		"description": "Today's image features white rhinoceros in Lake Nakuru, Kenya. Their journey illustrates the importance of conservation efforts. They have two subspecies: the near-threatened southern white rhinoceros and the critically endangered northern white rhinoceros. In the late 19th century, the southern white rhino, found in South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe and Kenya, was on the brink of extinction due to relentless poaching for their horns. But thanks to more than a century of dedicated management, their numbers have bounced back significantly. Unfortunately, the northern white rhino is in a precarious situation, with only two left—a mother and daughter. They're now under protection at Kenya's Ol Pejeta Conservancy.\nIndia is also home to its own rhino species, the Indian rhinoceros or greater one-horned rhinoceros. Historically, it roamed across the entire Indo-Gangetic Plain, but overhunting and agricultural expansion have drastically reduced its range, now limited to 11 sites in northern India and southern Nepal. Classified as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, its population is fragmented and confined to less than 20,000 square kilometres.",

		"description": "New Year's Eve, also known as Old Year's Day, is celebrated around the world with revelry, fireworks and for some, religious and cultural observances. Many countries celebrate with foods symbolic of prosperity, long life and good fortune for the coming year, and many people sing Scottish folk song 'Auld Lang Syne' at the stroke of midnight to remember old friends and past experiences. The new year is often personified as a baby, a tradition that dates back to ancient Greeks, often paired with an old man who represents the previous year.\nGet-togethers are a common way to ring in the new year, and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, throws a memorable one. Rio is known for many things, including colourful, exuberant celebrations, glorious beaches and the free New Year's Eve party at Copacabana beach, seen in today's image. Known as Réveillon to locals, this New Year's Eve soiree is the largest in the world, with millions of celebrators, including Rio natives who gather to honour their goddess of the sea.",

These animals have beneficial effects not only on water quality but also on land. With their iron-coated orange incisors, beavers fell trees, diligently constructing not just homes but habitats. Their dams create life-sustaining wetlands for countless species. Meanwhile, their lodges are masterpieces of security and comfort, the entrance strategically submerged to deter predators and provide privacy.

These sandstone balls—a phenomenon known as concretions—formed over millions of years as sedimentary layers built up around a central core of sand and stone held together by mineral cements. Erosion gradually wore away the outer layers to expose the spherical shapes we see today. This created a fascinating spectacle that only appears at low tide. Concretions are rare, and there has been plenty of wild speculation about where they come from, with some believing them to be extraterrestrial debris while others wondering if they are dinosaur fossils.

Now, it has grown into an annual event with more than a billion people in over 193 countries taking part.\nThis year, the campaign's focus is on plastics, which are a particularly serious form of pollution on land and in the oceans. Many species—including this green sea turtle—eat the plastic waste they find in the ocean, mistaking it for food. These same plastics pose an entanglement risk and can also break down to become microplastics. Every year some 25 million tonnes of plastic enter aquatic ecosystems. So, whether you're planting trees, cleaning up beaches or simply spreading the word, let's remember to promote sustainable living. After all, there's no planet B!",

It marks the shared death anniversary of William Shakespeare, Miguel de Cervantes and several other literary greats.\nIn India, the day aims to promote and raise awareness about reading and book publishing across the nation. Interestingly, each year, UNESCO crowns one city as the 'World Book Capital.' The chosen city then carries out activities aimed at promoting reading for the awarded year; this year it is Strasbourg, France. So, have you picked out a book to read yet?",

Despite their small size, Adélie penguins are sleek swimmers and can dive as deep as 175 metres in search of shrimp-like krill or fish. They are social animals which gather in small colonies for foraging, hunting and protection. While it may seem mischievous, Adélies steal pebbles from nearby nests to strengthen their own, safeguarding their eggs and chicks from Antarctica's harsh conditions and predators.",

These shrubs, known for their intricate network of stilt roots, play a crucial ecological role. Acting as 'green shields,' they provide essential protection against coastal erosion and help mitigate the potentially catastrophic effects of natural calamities. Having evolved unique mechanisms to absorb additional oxygen and expel salt, they endure conditions that are fatal to most flora. Their intricate salt filtration and robust roots enable them to withstand saltwater submersion and wave impact, while thriving in the low-oxygen mud of the intertidal zone's upper regions. Analysis of satellite imagery in 2014 has unveiled this hidden ecological treasure along Karnataka's coast. Despite mangroves being traditionally associated with India's east coast, Karnataka boasts a significant expanse of these vibrant saline-water ecosystems.",

These hummingbirds are typically vibrant in colour, but leucism means that they have decreased pigmentation, resulting in a paler appearance. Unlike albino birds, these hummingbirds retain some colour in their eyes. They are equipped with specialised adaptations like a long tongue for feeding on nectar from flowers. However, their diet is not limited to nectar alone; they also supplement their nutrition by consuming small insects and other arthropods. Their lighter plumage reduces protective camouflage, making them more vulnerable to predators such as hawks and feral cats.",

Hidden beneath its desert scenery are more than 119 caves—formed when sulphuric acid dissolved the surrounding limestone. This national park, founded on this day in 1930, is also home to North America's largest underground chamber—the Big Room. From colossal stalactite formations hanging like chandeliers to stalagmite structures reaching for the ceiling, every nook and cranny is a masterpiece crafted over millions of years. This UNESCO World Heritage Site also organises events like bat flight viewings, which allow visitors to watch thousands of bats as they swoop in and out of the cavern. So, are you ready to explore the depths?",

One of the best-known monuments in the area is Doria Castle, built in the 15th century as a defensive fortress to protect the village from frequent pirate attacks. Thanks to the construction of the Genoa–La Spezia rail line in the 19th century, the village became more accessible by land. The cobblestone streets and absence of cars make it ideal for walking around. While here, you might want to visit the Chapel of Santa Marta and the Sanctuary of Madonna di Reggio.

Bees come in a range of sizes, from just 0.20 centimetres all the way up to 3.9 centimetres, and there are over 20,000 known species. They are one of the most important pollinators in the world.

It's no overstatement to say that bees are vital for humans' survival.\nHoney bees, like the one in today's image, construct nests from wax and produce a surplus amount of honey. This excess means that humans can harvest honey without endangering the bees themselves.

They catch their prey mid-flight, returning to a perch where they can beat stinging insects to stun them, which makes them safe to eat. These birds are designed to hunt: their dazzling green plumage helps camouflage them in dappled jungle light, their curved beak is perfect for picking off insects with precision and their eyes can move individually, which makes them all the better for spotting bees.",

This year's theme focuses on land restoration, desertification and drought resilience.\nPictured here is Madagascar's Masoala National Park, part of the Rainforests of the Atsinanana UNESCO World Heritage Site. This park, which covers over 2,408 square kilometres, is a wildlife haven, harbouring 10 lemur species like red ruffed lemur and aye-aye, birds like red owl and helmet vanga, as well as other species such as Madagascar day geckos and tomato frogs. In times past, illegal rosewood loggers threatened this region, but the strength of unity and conservation has made a stand. So, let's take inspiration from Masoala and champion the planet that cradles us all. After all, there is no planet B.",

This day is about honouring and protecting the world's oceans and serves as a reminder of the critical role oceans play in supporting life on Earth. These gargantuan water bodies, after all, teem with wonders, from the tiniest plankton to the grandest whales like the humpbacks we see here. The oceans also produce almost half of the oxygen on our planet thanks to the photosynthesis of plankton—tiny plants, algae and bacteria. Moreover, they absorb a significant amount of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, helping mitigate the impacts of climate change caused by human activities.\nOceans face many threats, including rising sea temperatures thanks to global warming, plastic pollution and ocean acidification, which threatens many marine species. The theme for this year's World Oceans Day is 'Awaken New Depths.' This motto encourages us to delve deeper into the ocean's complexities and take urgent actions to ensure that these fascinating, ocean-dwelling animals continue to grace our planet for generations to come.

But the city's charm isn't just in its gastronomic delights. Step into the past's embrace at Osaka Castle, a majestic relic of Japan's rich history and a symbol of unwavering resilience.

The Registan Square is encircled by three Islamic schools, namely the Ulugh Beg Madrasah, the Sher-Dor Madrasah and the Tilya-Kori Madrasah, characterised by the Islamic architectural style, which typically features elaborate repetitive patterns and ornamental forms. The influence of Registan's magnificence is seen everywhere, from the Safavid monuments of Persia to the Mughal buildings of India and Pakistan.

Surfing involves riding a wave using a board, regardless of the stance. Ancient surfers often rode waves on their belly and knees. Today, surfing typically means riding a wave standing on a surfboard, known as stand-up surfing.\nWith more than 7,500 kilometres of coastline, encompassing its island groups, India presents a plethora of prime surfing locations. The peak of wave activity is typically between May and September, coinciding with the pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons.

		"description": "Amid the arid expanse of the Mojave Desert in Nevada, US, lies the natural grandeur of the Valley of Fire State Park. This park, which stretches across 186 square kilometres, is named after the fiery red Aztec Sandstone, an Early Jurassic geological formation made up of ancient sand dunes. The park's highlight, Fire Wave, is a geological marvel that appears like a frozen wave with its red, pink and white stripes.\nIn the park, you will come across mysterious petroglyphs, rock carvings made by scratching on the rock's surface, left by the Ancestral Puebloans, who were farmers from the nearby Moapa Valley. It is likely they practiced hunting and performed religious ceremonies in this area. If you are a history buff, you might want to try and decode the cryptic messages carved on the rock faces. Well, put on your hiking shoes and get ready to wander, to wonder and to witness the Valley of Fire State Park.",

		"description": "Dive deep beneath the waves surrounding the Banggai Islands in Indonesia and meet the Banggai cardinalfish. Cardinalfish can grow over 7 centimetres and have tiny shimmery bodies with black vertical stripes and white-edged fins, which help them disguise. Unlike some finned creatures that migrate long distances, these pint-sized fish inhabit a small world, rarely straying far from their local reefs.\nEach young cardinalfish begins life being guarded by their fathers, who carry the eggs in their mouths for up to 30 days to shield them from the aquatic perils. Within these jaws, young fish embark on a silent metamorphosis, soon to emerge, ready to explore the currents. In their early stages, they form dense schools for protection against predators and hide among the spines of sea urchins and anemones. The diet of these opportunistic feeders primarily consists of small fish, crustaceans and plankton. Their existence whispers tales of resilience—a creature to cherish and protect for the spectacle of life it presents.",

		"description": "Welcome to Florence, the cradle of the Renaissance! Let the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore transport you through time. More than just a church, this Gothic structure, with its red-tiled dome, is steeped in centuries of history. Built over an older cathedral dedicated to Santa Reparata, construction began in 1296 under the supervision of architect Arnolfo di Cambio.\nFilippo Brunelleschi, an Italian architect and designer, engineered its dome, which is the largest brick dome ever constructed. It was built without the support of traditional wooden frameworks; its completion in 1436 was the final stage of the cathedral's construction. It's not just the outside that dazzles; inside there are artistic treasures to discover, from Giorgio Vasari's fresco 'The Last Judgement' to Paolo Uccello's intricate clock face. The cathedral complex is also home to the Baptistery, a small basilica, and Giotto's Campanile, a free-standing bell tower. Step inside, and you're walking on history—every visit gives a glimpse of the past and a demonstration of human potential.",

At the time, homosexuality was illegal, and raids against LGBTQIA+ establishments were common. However, on that night, the patrons of the Stonewall Inn, fed up with the continued harassment, decided to stand their ground. Violence escalated, leading to clashes between protesters and police. In the following days, there was more rioting as people gathered to protest the raids.\nOn June 28 the following year, gay pride marches were held in New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago to mark the anniversary of the riots. Similar marches soon started to be held annually in hundreds of places across the US and the rest of the world. June 28 is now celebrated as International LGBTQIA+ Pride Day. In 2016, the Stonewall Inn, Christopher Park and several nearby streets were officially dedicated as the Stonewall National Monument. So, today is the perfect time to remember those who have fought for LGBTQIA+ rights before, during and after Stonewall.",

Meerkats are highly social animals, living in tight-knit groups called mobs, which can consist of up to 30 individuals.\nThese groups are a cooperative effort, with meerkats foraging together, grooming each other, babysitting and taking turns as sentinels to watch for predators. These critters create extensive burrows where they spend the night and retreat to escape the midday heat–meerkats love their afternoon siesta. Classed as 'least concern' on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species, these tiny mammals are vital for controlling insect populations in their desert habitats.

Another Marine Day tradition is to give something back to the ocean by throwing mudballs into the water; these balls are packed with microorganisms that help to purify the sea. Today's image takes us to Tateishi Park in Yokosuka. This scenic spot has stunning views of Sagami Bay and Mount Fuji, making it the perfect place to celebrate Japan's coastal waters on Marine Day.",

		"description": "Imagine swaying gently under a canopy of leaves, a soft breeze coaxing you into a serene slumber while you gaze at the stars above. Invented by the Indigenous peoples of Central and South America, hammocks were called 'Hamacas' and were originally woven for sleep and relaxation. Back then hammocks were made from the bark of trees, whereas now they can be made of various materials like cotton, nylon and canvas. They come in different shapes and sizes, like Nicaraguan hammocks, which are usually made of woven material with a wooden spreader bar. These sleeping swings have sailed across oceans as sailor beds, swung from the trees as forest dwellers' bedrooms and nowadays, add a touch of chill to hip outdoor retreats. They have health benefits, too; gentle rocking can improve your sleep and even relieve stress. So go ahead, jump into a hammock, and let it gently sway your worries away for a while.",

With origins as a self-ruling city, in the Middle Ages, this walled Bavarian town once flourished with 6,000 inhabitants, making it the Holy Roman Empire's second-largest city at the time. The growth of Rothenburg ob der Tauber slowed in the 17th century, preserving its original character.\nPictured here is Burgtor or the castle gate, which was built after the original Rothenburg Castle was destroyed by an earthquake in 1356. Within the castle gate is an 'eye-of-the-needle' door, designed to be the only way in and out of the castle when the main gates closed at night. But Rothenburg's magic isn't confined to its walls. It's also a gateway to the approximately 460-kilometre Romantic Road that runs from Würzburg to Füssen, covering Bavaria's castle-studded valleys. Upon return, things can get festive at the Käthe Wohlfahrt Christmas Village, a dream for holiday enthusiasts. So, 'burg' up for a medieval adventure.",

Running from July 15 to 21, Coral Reef Awareness Week is the perfect time to honour them. Coral reefs are formed by tiny marine organisms called coral polyps, which create vast colonies that serve as homes to a diverse array of marine species. As we turn our attention to their beauty and benefits, it's vital to recognise the lurking threats–climate change, pollution and harmful human activities.\nPictured here is Mayotte, a paradise beneath the Indian Ocean's surface. This French Island boasts one of the world's largest and deepest lagoons, encircled by a coral reef of nearly 160 kilometres long. Mayotte's lagoon is home to over 250 species of coral and over 3,500 marine species. But it is facing numerous threats, including overfishing and coral bleaching, where corals expel the algae that live in their tissues, leading to a loss of colour and essential energy sources. So, this week, let's pledge to preserve coral reefs like this one. Dive in, because every splash counts.",

Jaguars arrived in the Americas some 2 million years ago, migrating from Eurasia through the Bering Strait. Today, they inhabit diverse habitats, from the woodlands of southwestern United States to the rainforests of northern Argentina.\nOften found near bodies of water, jaguars are excellent swimmers, ambushing prey by leaping into the water. True carnivores, jaguars rely exclusively on meat for their nutritional needs. They feed on a wide range of animals, including deer, armadillos, monkeys and lizards. Their strong teeth and jaws can also bite through turtle shells and crocodile heads. In the Brazilian Pantanal, a small population of jaguars primarily feeds on aquatic reptiles and fish. So, the next time you are on a jungle trail, keep your eyes peeled and your senses sharp – remember: every rustle of leaves could be a jaguar on the prowl!",

Initially celebrated as National Moon Day in the United States, the day was recognised globally by the United Nations in 2021. Apollo 11, the pioneering space mission that first landed humans on the moon, was launched on July 16, 1969. It culminated in the astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin taking the first steps on the moon on July 20, 1969.\nThe Chandrayaan programme is India's ongoing lunar exploration series led by ISRO. It includes a lunar orbiter, an impactor, a soft lander and a rover. The programme has had three missions, yielding two orbiters and two lander-rover pairs. While Chandrayaan-2's lander and rover crashed, Chandrayaan-3 successfully landed on 23 August 2023, making India the first nation to land at the lunar south pole and the fourth to achieve a soft landing on the moon, following the Soviet Union, the USA and China. Moon missions have found no signs of life, but it could be a future site for human colonisation. The discovery of water ice, especially in the dark craters at the poles, makes it more hospitable for potential settlers. So, until you have a chance to live there, keep dreaming under the same moon that has captivated humanity since time immemorial.",

The Brahmanical caves, including the Kailasa Temple, were carved between the 7th and 10th centuries. From the 9th to the 12th centuries, the final phase, produced the Jain caves. The caves here exemplify the harmonious coexistence of three major religions—Buddhism, Brahmanism and Jainism—showcasing ancient India's spirit of tolerance.

The day commemorates our country's major military success against Pakistan during the war. After the 1971 Indo-Pakistani War, direct armed conflicts were rare until the 1990s when tensions rose due to separatist activities in Kashmir and nuclear tests by both nations in 1998. Despite the Lahore Declaration in 1999, Pakistan initiated the covert Operation Badri, leading to the Kargil War that lasted for almost 3 months.\nIn response to Operation Badri, India launched Operation Vijay, which involved intense combat in high-altitude mountainous terrain, presenting significant challenges for the Indian troops. Nevertheless, their bravery, determination and superior military strategy enabled them to achieve victory on July 26, 1999, a date now celebrated as Kargil Vijay Diwas.

Initially championed by the greeting card industry, Friendship Day saw a resurgence, especially in Bangladesh and Malaysia, along with India, fueled by social networking sites and the widespread use of mobile phones, digital communication and social media.\nFrom exchanging friendship bracelets to sharing social media posts and messages, people have come up with their own special traditions to appreciate their pals. This is a good day to reflect on the many ways friendship impacts our lives, much like the symbiotic relationship between the impala and the red-billed oxpecker, pictured here in South Africa. Both these animals get something out of this relationship: the oxpecker gets food by eating ticks from the impala's skin, while the impala gets to stay clean. This animal duo showcases nature's version of companionship. So, reach out to your friends to express gratitude and simply say, 'I appreciate you.'",

A member of the mint family, lavender originated in the Mediterranean, India and the Middle East. These purple-hued plants have thrived through various civilisations. It was used by the Egyptians for mummification; traces of lavender were discovered in the tomb of Tutankhamun. It was also treasured by the Romans for its healing and cleansing properties.\nLavender is planted during the spring season, reaching its peak bloom in July. It doesn't just look good, it smells great too, and is said to help people relax. The fragrant oil is a staple in wellness practices, including aromatherapy, where it's used for stress relief, and is a valued ingredient in the perfume industry. This plant is also used in the kitchen, adding a floral touch to dishes and drinks. So, next time you feel stressed, let a few drops of the lavender essential oil calm you down.",

The islet is all that remains of a volcano that erupted about 230,000 years ago. According to Hawaiian mythology, Pele the fire goddess was in love with a man named Mo'o. The trouble was that Mo'o was in love with another woman. Pele's revenge was typically violent: she cut her rival in two, her body becoming Molokini, while her head became Pu'u Olai, a cinder cone on Maui.\nThese days, Molokini Crater is a prime scuba and snorkelling destination; the islet's crescent shape protects divers from waves and currents, allowing them to enjoy the reef, where visibility can reach up to 45 metres. This habitat is home to at least 250 species of fish, including black triggerfish and parrotfish, 38 species of hard coral and some 100 species of algae. So, come on in, the water's lovely. Just be sure not to anger Pele.",

		"description": "Think you can win a staring contest with one of these? With piercing yellow eyes against a grey-brown face, spotted owlets are often seen when small birds spot them during the day and mob them. Once located, these primarily nocturnal owls will often stare down intruders, bob their heads and emit a loud 'chirurrr-chirurrr-chirurrr' screech, or what's sometimes described as laughter or chuckling.\nStanding around 20 centimetres tall, speckle-plumed spotted owlets can be found from Iran to Vietnam. This one was photographed in Bangkok, Thailand. They primarily eat insects and small mammals like bats and mice, which they often store to eat later when food is scarce. Spotted owlets are a remarkably resilient species that flourish in environments such as semi-deserts, rocky areas, forests, farmlands and urban areas. While they aren't endangered, the spotted owlet's population is thought to have declined in the last four years, perhaps owing to loss of habitat and increased urbanisation.",

During a jungle expedition, he found the entrance to a cave with a roaring underground river, which was later named Hang Sơn Đoòng, or 'cave of the mountain river.' In 2009, the British Cave Research Association led an expedition to explore the site. It was then that they realised something incredible: it was the world's largest cave.\nHow large, you ask? Hang Sơn Đoòng's main passage is 4.9 kilometres long, 149 metres wide and 201 metres high. That's tall enough to fit a 40-storey skyscraper! Inside, there is a 60-metre calcite barrier called the 'Great Wall of Vietnam' and stalagmites stretching as tall as 79 metres. It even has its own weather system; clouds form inside the cave due to temperature differences between the cave air and the outside air. Moreover, a subterranean river links Hang Sơn Đoòng to the nearby Hang Thung cave, suggesting yet undiscovered depths. Given its fragile ecosystem, strict regulations are in place to preserve Hang Sơn Đoòng's pristine condition. Tours of the cave are limited to 1,000 visitors per year.",

This habitat loss brings them into closer contact with humans, which can lead to serious problems for both elephants and humans.\nToday's image features a herd of African elephants roaming the vast expanses of Amboseli National Park, Kenya. Elephants live in groups that are made up of several families, which are led by an older female elephant called a matriarch. Males leave to live alone or in bachelor herds, joining females during mating. Sadly, all three species of elephants are endangered.

Today, World Lizard Day, is the perfect time to learn about these cold-blooded creatures. With more than 7,000 species, these animals have adapted to a wide range of environments—from deserts to rainforests. Take the gecko, for example. These little climbers have specialised toe pads that let them scale walls and even walk on ceilings. Then there's the chameleon, known for its colour-changing skin. While many think it's all about blending in, chameleons also change colour to communicate and regulate their temperature.\nNow let's focus on the peculiar creature in today's image that's trekking across the arid landscape in Australia's Watarrka National Park. Its pace is deliberate, its skin a maze of spiky armour. Meet the thorny devil, also known as the thorny dragon or Moloch. With clever hydrophilic skin that channels moisture to its mouth, this reptile can hydrate just from the dew on its body. It can thrive in extreme desert conditions that would be inhospitable to many. So, the next time you spot a lizard, take a moment to appreciate these cool, scaly wonders of the animal kingdom.",

The celebration is observed on the last day of the Hindu lunar month of Shravana, usually in August.\nThe term 'Raksha Bandhan' means the bond of protection, obligation or care in Sanskrit. Historically, the term referred to a different ritual where priests would tie amulets or threads on their patrons' wrists and receive gifts in return, a practice still followed in some areas. Over time, the sister-brother version of the festival, with roots in folk traditions, became more popular. The festival had different names in folk culture, depending on the region, like 'saluno,' 'silono' and 'rakri.' While it is typically a North Indian tradition, Raksha Bandhan is also celebrated in Central and Western India, Nepal, and among Hindu communities overseas, like in Fiji, as well as Pakistan and Mauritius.

		"description": "Today, let us step into Golconda Fort in the bustling city of Hyderabad. This fort once housed a vault that safeguarded some of the world's most famous gems, including the legendary Koh-i-Noor and Hope diamonds. The origins of the fort date back to the 11th century when it was first established as a modest mud fort by Pratāparudra of the Kakatiya Empire. It's also believed that the Kakatiya ruler Ganapatideva, who reigned from 1199 to 1262, constructed a stone outpost on the hilltop to protect the empire's western frontier.\nThis outpost would later evolve into the iconic Golconda Fort. In 1518, Sultan Quli of the Qutb Shahi dynasty expanded and transformed the fort into a formidable citadel, eventually designating the surrounding city as the capital of the Golconda Sultanate. In 2014, UNESCO added the Golconda Fort complex to its tentative list of World Heritage Sites in the region under the collective title 'Monuments and Forts of the Deccan Sultanate.' Although the fort is now abandoned, its historical importance still resonates strongly.",

Their dark scales are a masterstroke of camouflage, giving them an edge in hunting a variety of aquatic and terrestrial prey. Their role extends beyond predation, however. They indirectly protect our agricultural interests by maintaining balance within their ecosystem, preventing overpopulation of species such as piranhas and capybaras, which can affect local agriculture and livestock.",

		"description": "On August 30, India unites with the global community to shine a spotlight on whale sharks. Originally discovered off South Africa's coast in the 1820s, these creatures have patrolled the seas for more than 240 million years. The whale shark holds the record as the largest fish on Earth, reaching lengths up to 12 metres, with one exceptional individual measuring a remarkable 18.8 metres. Found in tropical oceans around the world, these filter feeders glide through the water, mouth wide open, straining plankton and small fish. Each pattern on their dotted, starry skin is as unique as a human fingerprint.\nSadly, the International Union for Conservation of Nature lists whale sharks as endangered due to overfishing, habitat loss and climate change. Amid adversity, there is hope, like in Cenderawasih Bay in Indonesia, a whale shark oasis that's pictured here. In this bay, these titans dine on the generosity of fishermen who feed them baitfish for luck, reflecting a unique bond between man and marine life.",

The exact origins of the festival are not clear, but it has been a prominent public celebration in Pune since the time of King Shivaji, who ruled from 1630 to 1680. Later freedom fighter Bal Gangadhar popularised it in Maharashtra in 1893. This move aimed to foster a 'Hindu nationalist identity' and resist British colonial rule.\nGanesh Chaturthi is observed with the installation of clay Ganesha idols both in homes and in grand public displays set up on temporary stages called pandals. The festivities conclude with a grand public procession, featuring music and collective chanting. On Ananta Chaturdashi, or the tenth day, the idol is carried to a nearby river or sea for immersion, known as 'visarjana'.

They feature a striking staircase formation, with a two-step cascade created by three layers of basalt.\nBefore these falls became the spot we know today, they had quite a journey. Spanish explorer Alvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca might have been the first European to see the falls. In 1907, businessman Domingo Ayarragaray saw the potential of this area and built a hotel and roads. The falls became such a sensation that they were designated as national parks in both countries—Argentina's Iguazu National Park in 1934 and Brazil's Iguaçu National Park in 1939.

Experts are divided on the timeline of the Polynesians' arrival, though many researchers suggest that it occurred around the 8th century. Take in the mesmerising sunrise featured in today's image and explore the striking volcanic craters and lush, grassy plains where the imposing statues stand. The World Heritage property of Easter Island spans more than 68 square kilometres, including four nearby islets.\nCurious about the island's name? The original inhabitants call it Rapa Nui, meaning 'Great Rapa,' referring to the land's topographic similarity to Rapa Island, part of the Austral Islands. Dutch explorer Jacob Roggeveen, the first European to visit, named it Paasch-Eyland, or 'Easter Island' in English, to mark his arrival on Easter Sunday. And although Easter may seem a long way from today, you can explore this unique World Heritage site year-round. Dive into its vibrant history and let the island's charm sweep you away.",

Named after Anna Masséna, Duchess of Rivoli, it's one of an estimated 366 hummingbird species, and is the most common species on North America's western coast. With its shimmering emerald feathers and sparkling rose-pink throat, this little bird is a sight to behold. Hummingbirds are known for their incredible speed; they can flap their wings up to 80 times per second, allowing them to hover in place and even fly backward. Emily Dickinson aptly describes their swift movement: 'A Route of Evanescence / With a revolving Wheel—.' Their high metabolism requires them to eat constantly, so they spend their days flitting from flower to flower, sipping nectar and catching insects.",

These marsupials, smaller cousins of the kangaroo, are native to Australia and New Guinea. Wallabies have around 30 different species, including brush wallabies, rock-wallabies, hare-wallabies, nail-tail wallabies and swamp wallabies. These agile and sprightly mammals are herbivores, nibbling on grasses, leaves and fruits. With a height of 30 to 105 centimetres, wallabies have strong hind legs that help them take impressive leaps and serve as a defence against predators. During mating season, male wallabies engage in boxing bouts to show dominance to grab females' attention. Social creatures, wallabies form small groups called 'mobs,' which provide safety and mutual grooming. Their playgrounds are forests that echo with the thudding of their hops as they navigate their home range with ease.",

It's traditionally observed on the 15th day of the eighth month in the Chinese lunar calendar. Dating back more than 3,000 years to China's Shang Dynasty, this festival celebrates moon watching and the end of the harvest season. During the festivities, mooncakes—round delicacies filled with sweet bean paste, salted egg yolks or lotus seeds—are often shared among friends and family. Lanterns of different shapes, sizes and hues, symbolising good fortune, illuminate the night. Asian communities across the world come together to showcase a mélange of cultural performances, heartfelt renditions of the Moon Festival's poetic tales.\nAs depicted in today's image, Gardens by the Bay in Singapore has been transformed into a mystical realm during this event.

He spent much of his final days on Ocracoke Island until his death in 1718. The island's residents speak the unique 'Hoi Toider' dialect, a blend of Elizabethan English, Irish and Scottish accents.

Meticulously carved from yellow sandstone blocks, these cenotaphs showcase the elegance of Rajasthani architecture, combining elements of Hindu and Islamic styles. Embellished with exquisite paintings, sculptures and inscriptions, these were built in four distinct sizes, each reflecting the royal hierarchy.\nThe story of this site begins with Jait Singh II, a descendant of Maharawal Jaisal Singh, the founder of Jaisalmer State. In the 16th century, he commissioned a dam that created a water tank, turning the surrounding barren landscape into a lush area. After his passing, his son, Lunkaran, established a garden by the lake and erected a memorial chhatri on a hill overlooking it. Over the years, more cenotaphs were added for Lunkaran and other members of the clan. The last chhatri, dedicated to Maharawal Jawahir Singh, remains unfinished.",

Sea otters are native to the northern and eastern coasts of the North Pacific Ocean. Weighing 13–45 kilograms, they're expert foragers, diving to the seabed to find food. These clever critters are smart as well as cute: they use rocks to crack open shellfish, making them one of the few animals that use tools. There used to be as many as 300,000 in the wild, but they were heavily hunted for almost two centuries, as their dense fur was highly prized. By 1911, it is thought that only around 2,000 were left. Thankfully, an international hunting ban, conservation efforts and reintroduction programs have helped them rebound, and they are now found in about two-thirds of their historic habitat. Despite this success, some populations are still struggling, and sea otters are still an endangered species.",

World Space Week is a celebration of all the science and technology that go into exploring and researching our universe, and how it benefits us back on Earth. As well as helping us to understand the universe we live in, space exploration has played an important role in helping scientists develop new medicines, create new power sources and even improve farming techniques. This year's theme is Space and Climate Change; events will be held in 83 countries to celebrate the vital role that space technology plays in understanding and monitoring how Earth's climate is changing.\nSpace exploration has also led to amazing photographs of our solar system, like the one featured here today. Europa is one of Jupiter's 95 known moons. Its surface is mainly made up of frozen water, which has broken up and refrozen, creating the patterns seen on its surface. In fact, although Europa is just a quarter of the size of Earth, it may contain two times the amount of water found in our planet's oceans. Space Week is the perfect time to take a moment to appreciate the wonders of our solar system, and beyond!",

Through gentle nudging, vocalisations and demonstrations, elephant mothers pass down vital knowledge that helps their young survive in the wild. Sadly, these precious animals face significant threats from habitat loss and poaching. As we admire these majestic creatures and strive to protect them, we can learn valuable lessons about empathy, cooperation and the importance of community.\nToday's image features the Tsavo East National Park, Kenya. This park, situated in Kenya's Taita-Taveta County, covers an impressive 13,747 square kilometres. Established in April 1948, this park encompasses a semi-arid region formerly known as the Taru Desert. Along with Tsavo West National Park, it creates a sprawling conservation area of roughly 22,000 square kilometres. Renowned as a global hotspot for biodiversity, Tsavo East offers a pristine sanctuary for a wide variety of wildlife.",

Octopuses are cephalopods, marine animals like squids and cuttlefish that have tentacles. Among their many species is the mototi octopus, pictured here. It was discovered in 1999 around Rapa Island in the South Pacific and is known for the 'fake eyes' or ocelli—vibrant blue and yellow rings—between its eyes and arms. Found in the Indo-Pacific region, including Indonesia, Australia and Okinawa in Japan, mototi octopuses are masters of disguise. They usually have a dull orange-cream-brown colour but when alarmed, they can quickly shift to striking maroon with white stripes along their body and arms. Also known as poison ocellate octopuses, these cephalopods are highly venomous. But you don't need to worry about running into one, because they tend to be shy and solitary, often hiding in crevices, shells or man-made objects like bottles and cans.",

		"description": "Slender white trunks reaching skyward and leaves fluttering even in the gentlest breeze—aspen trees are a symbol of the American wilderness. Found across the western states, especially in Utah and Colorado, these trees are the most widespread native species in North America. Their fall foliage is breathtaking, with their leaves turning a vibrant yellow that lights up the landscape, as seen in today's photo, which was taken near Marble, Colorado, USA.\nAspens are not only beautiful but also biologically fascinating. They grow in large colonies that originate from a single root system, making them some of the largest living organisms on Earth. Each tree in the colony is genetically identical. When an aspen tree is cut down or damaged, the root system remains alive, allowing new shoots to emerge and grow, which helps create a resilient network that can survive harsh conditions, including wildfires. This species quickly colonises areas that have been recently burnt down and can regenerate even after frequent fires. Aspen trees are more than just a treat for the eyes; they are an example of nature's resilience.",

Wood ducks, like the one in today's image, nest in tree cavities close to water and sometime take advantage of man-made boxes.\nThey typically breed in wooded swamps, shallow lakes, marshes, ponds and creeks throughout the eastern United States, the west coast, parts of southern Canada and Mexico's west coast. Sometimes, they nest as far as a mile from their water source. The females use feathers and other soft materials to line their nests, which are usually elevated, offering some protection from predators like raccoons, owls and hawks. During the breeding season, from February to April, you'll find the females laying 7–15 eggs. After breeding in the eastern and western United States and southern Canada, these ducks migrate southward in the fall to avoid harsh winter conditions. By October and November, they move towards milder climates in the southeastern United States and occasionally into Mexico.",

The Royal Alcázar of Seville, in the southern region of Andalusia, stands on the site of a 10th century citadel, which was expanded over the following 200 years. When Christian forces captured the city in 1248, the Alcázar was almost totally rebuilt in the Mudejar style, which takes inspiration from the intricate patterns and decorative motifs found in Islamic architecture. Within the Alcázar, there are several courtyards lined with delicately carved columns. One of these is the Patio de las Doncellas, or Courtyard of the Maidens, pictured here today.\nIn the centre of this beautiful space is a pool, whose still waters provide reflections of not only the blue Andalucian sky above, but of the intricate latticework of the courtyard's arches. Look a little closer at these arches, and you'll see carved shells, Hands of Fatima—a symbol said to bring protection—plants and Arabic script. Behind the columns, the walls are decorated with colourful ceramic times decorated with geometric patterns. These tiles, known as azulejos, are a hallmark of Andalusian decoration. Outside, there is a large garden, full of fountains and tree-lined paths—a perfect spot to cool off from the hot Spanish sun.",

Every July, roughly 2 million of these determined grazers, along with zebras and other herbivores, set off on a journey to the Maasai Mara in Kenya in search of lush pastures and fresh water.\nThe great migration, considered one of the seven wonders of the natural world, is a safari spectacle where survival is the prize. One of the most dramatic moments of the migration is the crossing of the Mara River. Thousands of wildebeests gather at the riverbank, aware that danger lurks beneath the surface—the crocodiles—not to mention the lions and leopards that patrol the banks. When the first wildebeest takes the plunge, it's a wild rush as the rest of the herd follows, creating a chaotic scene. Some make it across, while others become part of the food chain. As October rolls around and the rains return to the Serengeti, the herds begin their journey back south, completing the cycle once again.",

Sloths are mainly leaf eaters, although they also snack on fruits and tree sap to keep them going. To help them break down those tough, fibrous leaves, they have a special multi-chambered stomach. With their super slow metabolism, digestion takes its sweet time, and they don't need much food each day to get by. It's not just their stomachs that move at a leisurely pace; they're so slow-moving that algae often develop on their fur, giving a greenish tint, which handily also provides them camouflage.",

Federico Zuccari, who built the palace, was well-versed in monsters. His painting of the Last Judgement in Florence Cathedral and his illustrations of Dante's Inferno are replete with mythical beings.\nThe monster door originally led to the palazzo's garden because Zuccari enjoyed making his guests experience the contrast between the scary entrance and the beautiful serenity of the garden. These days, the door leads to the Bibliotheca Hertziana, a library specialising in Italian art history, from the Middle Ages to the modern day, which has occupied the site of the garden since 1912. If you're looking for more monstrous mouths in Rome, not far from the Palazzo Zuccari is the Bocca della Verità, an ancient Roman mask.

Madame Sherri's dramatic arrivals in town, often in a chauffeur-driven Packard, draped in furs, became the talk of the locals. As her fortune declined, her 'castle' fell into disrepair and was vandalised. In 1959, she returned to find her property in ruins and never came back. A fire destroyed the house in 1963, leaving behind only the stone foundation, an iconic staircase and a large fireplace leading to a lone chimney.\nToday, the forest where her house once stood spans over 2 square kilometres and offers scenic hiking trails through woodlands, hemlock groves and around peaceful brooks, a picturesque setting for outdoor enthusiasts. Managed by the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests, this area was named in honour of Madame Sherri, and it also includes trails that lead to the ruins of her former estate.

		"description": "In the ghostly silence of Bodie in California, United States, it feels like time stands still. This once-booming gold rush town was established in 1860. Bodie was named after W.S. Bodey, a prospector who discovered gold but tragically died in a blizzard before seeing the town's rise. When large deposits of gold were found there, it grew to nearly 10,000 residents, with saloons, dance halls and breweries lining its streets. But as the gold ran dry, so did the town's fortunes. The mines closed, the population dwindled and by 1915, the place was abandoned. Bodie's streets are now empty, its wooden buildings frozen in decay.\nMuch like Bodie, India has its own share of once-thriving places that have fallen into eerie silence, transforming into ghost towns. These were once vibrant, bustling communities full of life, but over time, they were consumed by darkness and loss, leaving only traces of their former glory. Now, these places—like Hampi, Kuldhara, Lakhpat, Mandu and Dhanushkodi—are deserted, cold and haunting, much like Bodie's empty streets and decaying buildings. Stepping into these forgotten towns is like walking into the past, where the echoes of what once was linger in the air.",

		"description": "Glistening like a jewel under the sun, the Golden Temple is not just a place of worship—it's an experience for the soul. A gurudwara in Amritsar, Punjab, it is also known as Sri Darbar Sahib or Sri Harmandir Sahib. The site's journey began in 1577, when Guru Ram Das, the fourth Sikh Guru, completed the man-made pool surrounding the temple. Fast forward to 1604, and it was the fifth Guru, Guru Arjan, who placed the sacred Adi Granth within the temple, shaping its spiritual significance. Despite facing destruction multiple times at the hands of Mughal and Afghan invaders, the Sikhs showed resilience, rebuilding the temple each time.\nIn 1809, Maharaja Ranjit Singh stepped in, giving the temple its present look by reconstructing it with marble and copper, and later, covering its sanctum with gold leaf in 1830—hence the name, Golden Temple. What makes this gurudwara truly special is its unique design. Built lower than the land around, it represents humility and equality. The Golden Temple, with its four entrances on all sides, symbolises its open doors to people of all backgrounds, warmly welcoming everyone regardless of caste, creed or religion.",

In general, 'pumpkins' refer to the mature edible fruits of all five Cucurbita species, which are typically not baked.\nIn India, pumpkins are a popular warm-season fruit that is widely cultivated across the country and goes by different names such as kashiphal, sitaphal or lal kaddu. These fruits come in various shapes, including oblong, round and oval, with weights ranging from 2 to 20 kilograms. The flesh colour varies from pale yellow to deep crimson, and they are normall between 3.5 and 5.5 centimetres thick. Pumpkins are grown extensively for both their immature and mature fruits and hold importance due to their high carotene content and excellent storage life.",

With its keen vision, eerie vocalisations and silent flight, this owl has historically been revered and feared. In folklore and mythology, owls were considered symbols of wisdom and omens of death. On Samhain, the Celtic precursor to Halloween, the owl was believed to be the kin of roaming spirits.\nThe owl in today's image is far more than a character in ghostly tales. Often called the 'tiger of the air,' the great horned owl, named for its signature feathers that look like horns, is one of the most fearsome and adaptable predators in the ornithological world. Primarily active at night, the owl has large, powerful talons that exert around 2,100 kilopascals of pressure, which it uses to grab prey like small rodents and skunks. It has incredible night vision, but its eyes are fixed, so it must turn its head a whopping 270 degrees to see everything. So, whether you hear it hooting from treetops or see it flying in the night, this owl proves that not all scary apparitions are supernatural.",

Also known as Lady Glamis, a noblewoman accused of witchcraft by King James V, she is believed to still lament her fiery execution in 1537. Others say the Grey Lady might be the ghost of Marie de Guise—mother of Mary, Queen of Scots—mourning her lost power amid the turmoil of religious reform. Then there's the Dung Man, a prisoner who attempted to escape in a wheelbarrow full of excrement. He died from the fall when the cart was emptied from the castle wall. The lost piper, who vanished into underground tunnels, continues to play a haunting melody beneath the city. And in 2001, the shadowy figure of a man in a leather apron emerged during a paranormal research project, leaving volunteers with a chilling memory. Spooked yet?",

Now, over 500,000 bison roam again, many in protected areas like Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, United States, featured in today's image. From the buffalo nickel to state flags, they are a deeply embedded symbol in American culture. Bison are North America's largest mammals, and they have been introduced as far away as Russia.

The highlight of the festival is the release of 'khom loi' or 'khom loy'—floating paper lanterns—into the night sky, creating a beautiful sight as the heavens fill with a sea of warm, golden lights. Locals and visitors gather around temples and palaces to send their wishes skyward, hoping for good fortune in the year to come. In addition to the lantern release, the city is adorned with vibrant parades, traditional dance performances and stunning decorations.",

Blind at birth, these little ones are vulnerable in the first few weeks of their lives and depend entirely on their mothers. At around eight weeks old, they meet the rest of the pride.

The Romans established January 1 as the beginning of the year in 153 BCE, but this fell out of favour throughout Europe during the medieval era. Since 1582 and the widespread adoption of the Gregorian calendar, however, much of the world now celebrates the new year today. In addition to watching fireworks, drinking champagne and making resolutions in the wee hours of the morning, other global traditions include making noise, eating lucky foods and giving gifts.\nIf you're wondering what polar bears like the ones in today's image have to do with the new year, the answer is simple: polar bear plunges. Countries around the world hold winter events where participants enter frigid, often icy bodies of water and communities in the United States, Canada, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom do this on New Year's Day.

		"description": "'Don't adventures ever have an end? I suppose not. Someone else always has to carry on the story.' Today, on Tolkien Day, fans around the world honour the master storyteller who crafted the epic adventures of Middle-earth: J.R.R. Tolkien. While Tolkien may have started the tale, it's his readers who carry it forward, generation after generation, diving into the pages of 'The Hobbit,' 'The Lord of the Rings' and beyond. For today's featured image, it is only fitting to visit a place that might have inspired the literary legend: the Radcliffe Camera, or Rad Cam, at the University of Oxford in England.\nOriginally a science library, the domed, circular building now serves as a reading room for the Bodleian Library. This 18th-century building is said to be an inspiration for Sauron's temple to Morgoth on Númenor in Tolkien's fiction. Though Tolkien himself didn't study there—he was a student at Exeter College—he would have passed by the Rad Cam countless times during his years as a professor of English Language and Literature at Oxford. In a similar vein, Amish Tripathi, a former banker, has taken up the mantle of storytelling, weaving India's mythological heritage into modern blockbusters. Hailed as 'India's Tolkien' and 'Asia's Paulo Coelho,' he continues the tradition of crafting epic sagas that captivate readers and inspire a devoted following.",

		"description": "Welcome to a spot where rivers meet borders in the most stunning way: Bản Giốc – Detian Falls, featured in today's image. Tucked between the karst hills of Daxin County in China and Trùng Khánh district in Vietnam, these falls tumble along the Quây Sơn River. Over 25 metres tall and more than 80 metres wide, it holds the distinction of being the widest waterfall in Vietnam. Located over 270 kilometres north of Hanoi, the waterfalls have gradually worn away their crest over the years, inching upstream. For most of the year, they flow as two distinct cascades, but come summer, when the rains swell the river, they merge into one big fall. Even with better roads, easier public transport and drone videos showing off the jaw-dropping beauty of the falls, Bản Giốc remains refreshingly off the beaten path. Mass tourism hasn't caught up yet, and on most weekdays, you'll find only a handful of visitors—just you, the locals and the sound of cascading water.\nJust as Bản Giốc stuns with its beauty, Chitrakoot Falls in India captivates with its scale and seasonal transformation. This waterfall, often called the 'Niagara Falls of India,' is renowned for its breathtaking width. During the monsoon season, it stretches up to an impressive 300 metres, making it the widest waterfall in the country, with water tumbling down from a height of about 30 metres. Interestingly, the fall's width changes with the seasons, adding a dynamic charm to its beauty.",

These beautifully designed tanks, with their perfectly laid stone steps, were crafted to make access to the water easy. These tanks have deep cultural significance and are highly revered. Historically, Pushkaranis were built for ritualistic temple practices or as royal amenities during the Vijayanagara Empire. In Hampi, almost every grand temple has one tank, serving both spiritual and functional purposes. The Pushkarani in front of the Sri Krishna Temple, seen in today's image, is one of the most elegant and accessible tanks here.\nThe structure's symmetry showcases the skilled craftsmanship of its time. Beyond the ceremonial significance, it served as a vital resource for the community, providing water for public use. Dedicated to Bala Krishna, the infant form of Lord Krishna, this temple is a treasure trove of history and architecture. With intricately carved pillars and a grand sanctum, it continues to attract travellers and history buffs alike.",

This Romanesque church, originally built in 450 CE, features a sturdy square bell tower added in the 9th century, enhancing the basilica's exterior. Its design features three naves, divided into two rows of 12 columns each. Featured in today's image is the basilica's real showstopper: the basement crypt, or burial chamber is a stunning model of early religious design. Complete with vaulted ceilings that slope down into rows of stone columns, its floor is a work of art itself. It's inlaid with beautifully intricate mosaic tiles that have withstood the test of time.\nBuilt on soft marshland, Ravenna faces ongoing structural challenges because the entire city is gradually sinking. This is particularly evident in the crypt, which now remains perpetually submerged under about a foot of water. But instead of battling the slow flood, Ravenna has embraced it, filling the pool with goldfish that glide between the ancient columns and above the submerged mosaics. Visitors here often toss coins into the water, likely wishing for good luck, making this crypt more of a wishing well than a burial site.",

The Moeraki Boulders, some of which are over two metres in diameter, have been shaped by nature over millions of years. Each boulder started as a pebble on the seabed around 65 million years ago. Over time, layers of mud and silt built up around them, cemented together by calcite. Thanks to erosion and the movement of the sea, the boulders eventually emerged. According to local Māori legends, the Moeraki Boulders are remnants of eel baskets, calabashes and kūmara that washed ashore from the wreck of Āraiteuru, a great sailing canoe.\nThe legend also connects the rocky shoals extending from Shag Point to the petrified hull of the canoe, while a nearby rocky promontory is said to represent the body of its captain. The intricate patterns on the boulders are believed to be the preserved traces of the canoe's fishing nets, further weaving the story of the vessel into the landscape. Today, new boulders are still appearing, while the elements are slowly breaking down existing ones.",

The experience varies from well-preserved sections like Mutianyu to wild, unrestored parts such as Jiankou. The Great Wall of China isn't just a wall, but a symbol of perseverance and strength.\nSimilarly, Kumbhalgarh, often called the 'Great Wall of India,' embodies its own history and enduring legacy. It is in the Aravalli Hills in the Rajsamand district of Rajasthan. Situated about 48 kilometres from Rajsamand city and 84 kilometres from Udaipur, this impressive structure was built in the 15th century by Rana Kumbha.

At the heart of this vast, arid expanse is Sossusvlei, seen in today's image. A salt and clay pan surrounded by towering dunes, Sossusvlei tells a story of contrasts. Every 10 years or so, an extraordinary event occurs when the Tsauchab River floods the pan, transforming it into a stunning turquoise lake. From the adaptable gemsboks to the ingenious Namib desert beetle that drinks fog droplets that collect on its back, the Namib is brimming with stories of survival and resilience.\nThe Thar Desert—also known as the Great Indian Desert—shares a similar vastness, stretching across the north-western part of the Indian subcontinent. This desert approximately covers 200,000 square kilometres across India and Pakistan. Ranking as the 18th-largest desert in the world, it is also the 9th-largest hot subtropical desert. Around 85% of this desert is in India, with the remaining 15% in Pakistan.

Created in 1972, Abraham Lake is a man-made reservoir that spans more than 50 square kilometres along the North Saskatchewan River. Thanks to glacier-fed waters from the Rocky Mountains, the lake stays transparent even in the coldest months. The glacial meltwater carries fine sediment that scatters sunlight, while natural filtration through rocks keeps pollutants to a minimum.\nThe snowy season attracts photographers and visitors from around the world who are eager to capture a rare sight at Preacher's Point: the bubbles. These frozen globes form when microorganisms break down dead plants and animals on the lake bed, releasing methane. As the gas rises, it gets trapped by the ice, creating layers of bubbles in various sizes and shapes. It's wild to think that they're flammable and chilling under your feet. The ice is thickest in January and February, making the bubbles clearly visible. If you're planning to check it out, just remember to stick close to the shoreline for your safety.",

		"description": "An imperial city in northern central Morocco, Meknes is steeped in history. Meknes reflects the Moroccan style of architecture, with one of its most impressive landmarks being Heri es-Swani, seen in today's image. Heri es-Swani was originally constructed as a stable and for storing vast amounts of grain to sustain the settlement and the Sultan's armies. Its design was both practical and impressive—thick walls and an innovative cooling system helped maintain the food supply. Twenty-two rows of symmetrical arches divided the space into corridors that used to have vaulted ceilings. Back then, mules climbed onto the roof terrace to deliver grain, which was then dropped through specially designed holes in the ceiling below. The structure housed more than 12,000 horses. Today, it stands as an empty shell, acting as a scenic backdrop ready to be explored.\nSimilarly, India's architectural legacy reflects its rich history, cultural diversity and religious roots. From the intricate Hindu temple designs and majestic Indo-Islamic styles to Rajput grandeur, Mughal elegance and the unique Indo-Saracenic fusion, Indian architecture is a testament to centuries of innovation and artistic expression. Both Meknes and India's architectural wonders highlight how design can harmonise functionality with cultural identity, leaving a legacy that continues to inspire.",

As part of this tradition, Calennig, meaning 'New Year's gift' in Welsh, plays a central role, linking the celebration to customs from the Julian calendar era. Even after most of the world switched to the Gregorian calendar in 1582, some Welsh communities clung to their old ways. Traditionally, the day involves children going door-to-door, singing songs and offering good wishes in exchange for gifts like coins, food or sweets. A unique feature is its clove-decorated apples. These aren't for snacking, though; they're miniature symbols of luck and prosperity.\nWhile these old traditions have evolved in some parts of Wales, the spirit of Calennig thrives. Cities like Cardiff, the capital of Wales, have transformed the celebration into large-scale events, complete with fireworks, markets and community gatherings. If your New Year's resolutions are already wobbling by January 13, Calennig offers a do-over. So why not embrace a little Welsh magic?

It all began in 1908 when President Theodore Roosevelt designated the area as a national monument. Later in 2013, Pinnacles earned its status as a national park. This land owes its formations to an ancient volcanic eruption that occurred 23 million years ago. The fiery beginnings made towering spires, cliffs and talus caves—created by falling boulders wedged into narrow canyons. Over millennia, tectonic forces shifted the landmass northward, leaving the park far from its volcanic birthplace. Talk about a journey!\nThis place offers a variety of trails, from easy walks to challenging climbs. The High Peaks Trail, featured in today's image, tests your stamina with steep climbs and narrow passages, while Bear Gulch Reservoir provides a more relaxed stroll. Moreover, Pinnacles is home to a range of wildlife including bobcats, jackrabbits and black-tailed deer and bird species like woodpeckers and bats, making it attractive for wildlife enthusiasts.

Although it's the smallest of the eight pelican species worldwide, it's still a large bird, measuring about 1.2 metres in length and having a wingspan of over 1.5 metres. The brown pelican is a piscivore, meaning its diet mainly consists of fish. Dixon Lanier Merritt's limerick famously begins, 'A wonderful bird is the pelican; his bill can hold more than his belly can,' and it's spot on—its pouch can store up to three times the volume of its stomach. This versatile feature acts as a scoop, a tool for cooling off during hot weather and a feeding trough for young pelicans. The brown pelican faced near extinction twice, first due to hunting and later from the impact of pesticides like DDT. Today, it's an Endangered Species Act and Environmental Protection Agency success story.\nIn India, the spotlight turns to the spot-billed pelican, another member of the pelican family, renowned for its distinctive features and adaptability.

The entire cave complex stretches on for around 4 kilometres, although visitors can only access about 300 metres of the total. Inside, there's a labyrinth of lit pathways winding past stalactite and stalagmite formations, leading to an over 100-metres-long saltwater lake.\nNeptune's Grotto is near the town of Alghero on the northwest coast of Sardinia, the second largest island in the Mediterranean. It has been inhabited for at least 10,000 years, but its most important ancient civilisation, the Nuragic peoples, lived there from around 1800 BCE until the 2nd century CE. At this time, villages were built around nuraghes, a kind of round tower fortress. Today, there are still around 7,000 of these nuraghes across the island and they have become a symbol of Sardinia.

From the tiny least pygmy squirrel—more than 13 centimetres long—to the Bhutan giant flying squirrel at more than one metres, these mammals come in all shapes and sizes. Today's image features a Eurasian red squirrel, photographed in the Netherlands. The red squirrel can be found across Europe and Russia, from western Spain and Portugal all the way to eastern Siberia. Their diet mainly consists of nuts, fungi, seeds and berries, but they will occasionally eat birds' eggs. In addition to being the national mammal of Denmark, they also play a part in old Norse mythology. Ratatoskr is a red squirrel who scurries up and down Yggdrasil, the sacred tree, carrying messages and spreading gossip.\nIndia is home to a diverse array of squirrel species, including the Indian palm squirrel and the Indian giant squirrel. The Indian palm squirrel, a native rodent, is a familiar sight in many regions, known for its adaptability. Meanwhile, the Indian giant squirrel, or Malabar giant squirrel, stands out with its vibrant colours and impressive size. This arboreal, herbivorous species thrives in India's forests, living a diurnal life high in the canopy, adding charm and vitality to the country's rich wildlife.",

Tucked in the heart of Jordan's arid desert landscapes, this ancient city once thrived as the capital of the Nabataean Kingdom in the 2nd century BCE. It was also a hub of the spice trade, connecting distant regions like China, Egypt, Greece and India. The city was abandoned for around 500 years before being rediscovered in 1812, earning it the 'Lost City' moniker.\nAd-Deir, seen in today's image, dates to the 1st century CE. Its design is characterised by a combination of Hellenistic and Mesopotamian influences. Although the exact purpose of the structure is debated, it's believed to have been used as a church during the Byzantine period. Standing nearly 45 metres tall and 48 metres wide, its massive facade is carved directly into the sandstone cliffs, showcasing the Nabataeans' ingenious craftsmanship and architecture. The journey to this landmark involves a steep hike up 800 stone steps, winding through rocky terrain. At the top, you're rewarded with panoramic views of the rugged Petra valley that make the climb more than worth it.",

Located in the geothermal area beside the Hvítá River in Iceland, this geyser erupts every 6 to 10 minutes, shooting hot water 14 to 20 metres into the air, sometimes erupting up to 40 metres.\nThe geothermal valley is also home to a variety of geothermal wonders, including bubbling mud pools, steaming fumaroles and other geysers. Strokkur geyser remained active until the early 20th century when an earthquake once again blocked its conduit. In 1963, following recommendations from the Geysir Committee, locals cleared the obstruction from the basin's bottom, restoring its activity. Since then, the geyser has been erupting regularly. There is science behind its eruption—magma beneath the Earth's crust heats groundwater until the pressure builds up, forcing the water explosively to the surface. Strokkur draws visitors from around the world eager to witness its powerful displays.",

Found on all continents except Antarctica and Australia, it's one of the most widely distributed bird species. In India, it can be spotted in the open grasslands and vast stretches of the Little Rann of Kutch, as well as the surrounding desert landscape. This raptor belongs to the genus Asio, whose members are characterised by feather tufts ('ears') on their heads. The short-eared owl only reveals its tufts when feeling defensive.\nBecause of the irregular wingbeats, its flight is on the floppy side, much like a moth or bat. It likes to glide a few metres above the ground in open fields and grasslands, swooping down feet first to grab its prey. Owls primarily hunt at night, but this silent hunter is also active during the day and at dusk. Its daylight hunts often line up with the peak activity of small rodents called voles—its favourite meal. Known to relocate to areas with higher rodent populations, the short-eared owl even wanders nomadically in search of better food supplies during years when vole populations are low.",

		"description": "Today's image features one of the simplest yet most essential inventions in human history: the umbrella, or parasol. Over 4,000 years ago, in ancient Egypt, Assyria and China, these foldable canopies were first used to shield people from the sun. It wasn't until the 17th century that the umbrella, as we know it today, gained popularity in Europe, initially as a luxury item primarily for women. Fast-forward a few centuries, and these weather shields have become a staple in pop culture, too. Remember Mary Poppins with her iconic umbrella that helped her fly, or Rihanna's hit song 'Umbrella'?\nBeyond their functionality, they've also made their mark in art and fashion. They often feature in artistic installations, such as the vibrant display at Borough Market in London, pictured here. But have you ever wondered why so many of them are left behind on trains? They're among the most commonly lost items worldwide!",

This masterpiece of early Buddhist art is near Datong in Shanxi province, northeastern China. Carved into sandstone cliffs over 1,500 years ago during the Northern Wei dynasty (386–534/535 CE), the grottoes contain 254 caves. The highlight is the massive Buddha in Cave 5, which is over 15 metres tall. But don't stop there—each cave offers something unique. Some are like ancient storyboards, depicting tales from Buddhist scriptures, while others showcase detailed carvings of monks, deities, musicians and even scenes of daily life under Wei rule. Caves 16–20, known as the 'Tanyao Five Caves,' were the first to be carved at Yungang, overseen by the monk Tanyao. While you're there, be sure to explore Cave 20's seated Buddha idol in a meditation posture, with a standing attendant Buddha on one side.\nThe reverence for Buddhist artistry transcends borders, as seen in the Great Buddha statue in Bodh Gaya, Bihar—a prominent attraction for pilgrims and tourists alike. Towering at 18.5 metres, the statue depicts the Buddha seated in the serene dhyana mudra (meditation pose) atop an open-air lotus. The construction, started in 1982, took seven years and involved 12,000 skilled stonemasons. It used a blend of sandstone and red granite. Inside, a spiral staircase winds up to the chest, with interior walls showcasing 16,300 miniature bronze Buddha images.",

It served as the capital of the Vajjika League of Vrijji mahajanapada, dating all the way back to the 6th century BCE. Vaishali also played a starring role in Buddhism, as it was here that Gautama Buddha delivered his final sermon before attaining parinirvana around 483 BCE.\nThat's not all—Vaishali is also home to one of the most beautifully preserved Ashokan pillars, featured in today's image. Through stylistic and technical analysis, experts have pieced together a tentative timeline for the Ashokan pillars. The Vaishali pillar is believed to be one of the earliest, recognised by its short, sturdy column, the simplistic design of its rigid lion and the plain, undecorated square abacus. This pillar features a single lion capital and stands near the site of an ancient Buddhist monastery and a sacred coronation tank. Interestingly, the lion atop the pillar faces north, symbolising the direction Buddha took on his final journey. While more pillars are scattered across the region, they lack their original capitals, making this one a rare and remarkable find.",

Over time, climate change caused water levels to drop; these days, the lake is normally dry, except in winter when it's covered in over 5 centimetres of water. The name 'Tyrrell' comes from the local Wergaia word for 'sky,' a nod to the Boorong Aboriginal People's interest in astronomy. Spanning more than 180 square kilometres, Lake Tyrrell is a haven for wildlife, including Mallee reptiles, kangaroos and emus.\nIn recent years, the lake has become a tourist hotspot. People come from all over the world during the winter months, drawn by its mirror-like surface that reflects the endless Australian sky, making it the perfect photo op.

Humpbacks can grow over 15 metres long and weigh more than 35,000 kilograms. They travel over 16,000 kilometres annually, feeding in polar waters and breeding in warmer seas. Though their numbers have partially recovered, they still face challenges like fishing gear entanglement and ship collisions. Efforts to protect whales extend beyond awareness days. Sanctuaries like the Indian Ocean Whale Sanctuary play a vital role in safeguarding diverse species, including the awe-inspiring blue whale, fin whale, humpback whale and sperm whale, providing a refuge where these marine giants can thrive.",

It was named Fatehpur Sikri, meaning 'City of Victory,' in 1573, following his victorious campaign in Gujarat. Beyond being a military stronghold, it flourished as a hub for scholars, poets and artists, reflecting emperor's vision of cultural and intellectual excellence. The city was entirely abandoned in 1610, marking the end of its role in Mughal history.\nFatehpur Sikri showcases Akbar's genius in combining Islamic and Hindu architectural styles. The building style of the city draws inspiration from Timurid forms and designs, reflecting the grandeur typical of the Mughal Empire. Additionally, Gujarati influences can be observed in the intricate details and decor of the palaces, adding another layer of cultural richness. Encircled by an 11-kilometre-long fortification wall with majestic gateways, its highlights include the Imperial Palace Complex, the intricately designed marble tomb of Sheikh Salim Chishti and the grand mosque.

A single square centimetre of their fur can hold more than 70,000 hairs, making it one of nature's most effective insulators. River otters were once endangered due to pollution and habitat loss. Yet, thanks to conservation efforts, their populations are rebounding in many regions across Europe.\nOtters are naturally playful, often sliding down snowy or muddy banks and diving underwater to find pebbles to play with. These solitary creatures communicate using a repertoire of whistles, squeaks and even scent, which also helps them mark their territorial boundaries. If you find yourself near a serene river in their range, keep an eye out—you might just spot one of these elusive river-dwellers.",

They're also found in Canada—like the cub in today's image, photographed in Churchill, Manitoba. Polar bears spend over half of their time hunting for seals on the sea ice, although they usually catch just one or two for every 10 that they try to catch. Their reliance on sea ice for hunting means that they are highly vulnerable to climate change. Sea ice is rapidly disappearing as the planet heats up, and polar bears are at risk of malnutrition and starvation as their hunting grounds vanish. Shrinking ice sheets also mean that these bears have to swim farther to find food, which depletes their energy reserves.

		"description": "A breathtaking maze of sandstone formations and awe-inspiring views awaits you at Bryce Canyon National Park in Utah. People have lived in this area for at least 10,000 years, including the Anasazi, Pueblo and Paiute Peoples. The hoodoos—tall, thin spires of rock formed by erosion—in the park inspired Paiute mythology: they believed them to be the Legend People turned to stone by the trickster Coyote.\nThe first European Americans arrived in the area in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and some eventually settled there in the 1850s. Bryce Canyon was named after Ebenezer Bryce, who had a homestead nearby. On this date in 1928, it was declared a national park. These days, the park is famous for its hoodoos. Every year, over 2 million visitors come to marvel at these geological formations. In fact, Bryce Canyon National Park has the highest concentration of hoodoos anywhere on Earth.",

Known for its dramatic cliffs, dense rainforests and cascading waterfalls, this UNESCO World Heritage Site is a treasure trove of natural beauty and biodiversity. Among the most iconic features of the Blue Mountains region are the eucalyptus trees, pictured here. Home to 92 species of eucalyptus, this area offers visitors a chance to marvel at these resilient trees, which are central to Australian wildlife. Their aromatic leaves provide food for koalas, while their bark and canopy create habitats for countless birds and insects. Also nestled within the mountains is the Megalong Valley. Just a two-hour drive from Sydney, this region is home to getaway cabins, wineries and the Megalong Valley Tearooms, a charming retreat where you can enjoy freshly baked scones paired with local jams.\nIn India, eucalyptus trees thrive across various regions of India, including Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana, Kerala and the Nilgiri Hills. They flourish best in deep, fertile, well-drained, loamy soil with sufficient moisture. They can also be spotted in the lush landscapes of Nagarhole and Bandipur National Parks in Karnataka.",

This year's theme is 'Wildlife Conservation Finance: Investing in People and Planet.' The events emphasise exchanging ideas, presenting solutions and diving into how innovative finance can help stop biodiversity loss and create a more sustainable future. Schools, conservation groups and wildlife parks host events such as nature walks, workshops, art contests, wildlife photography competitions and conservation talks to raise awareness. One species worth learning about is the southern yellow-billed hornbill, pictured here, a bird found throughout Southern Africa and commonly spotted in Kruger National Park in South Africa.\nRecognisable by its bright yellow, curved bill, this bird is often seen hopping on the ground in search of food. Its diet includes insects, seeds, fruits, berries, nuts and small reptiles, making it a key player in the ecosystem as both a predator and seed disperser. Social creatures, these hornbills are usually found in pairs or small groups, often foraging together. Their calls—whistling, grunting and cackling—echo across the savannah.",

Built in 1591 by Sultan Mohammed Quli Qutb Shah, the Charminar is an architectural marvel shrouded in legend.\nWhat does the Charminar symbolise? The true purpose behind its creation remains a mystery. It is commonly believed that this grand square-shaped structure was constructed in honour of Qutb Shah's wife, Bhagmati. Another widely accepted belief is that the Charminar was built to mark the end of a devastating plague that had gripped the city. It is said that the Sultan fervently prayed for his people's relief, and when the epidemic subsided, he commissioned this monument as an expression of gratitude to Allah. The site is a focal point of major celebrations, especially during Eid-ul-Adha and Eid al-Fitr, given its proximity to the revered Makkah Masjid.",

And then there's Cheow Lan Lake—a reservoir created for hydropower in 1982 when the Rajjaprabha Dam was built. Over time, the lake transformed the landscape into something you'd think was straight out of a movie, as featured in today's image. The dam, originally known as the 'Cheow Lan Project,' was later renamed Rajjaprabha, meaning 'light of the kingdom,' a tribute to King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who ruled from 1946 to 2016.\nJust as Khao Sok thrives as a biodiversity hotspot, the Brahmaputra Valley semi-evergreen forests echo a similar richness. It forms a tropical moist broadleaf ecoregion spanning Northeast India, southern Bhutan and parts of Bangladesh.

Native to North America, these sheep are known for their distinctive curled horns, which can weigh more than 10 kilograms. Rams use their massive horns in intense head-butting contests. During these battles, males hurl themselves at each other in charges of over 30 kilometres per hour. Ewes, on the other hand, tend to keep things more low-key, forming smaller groups with their lambs. Adapted to the desert environment, bighorn sheep can go long periods without water, relying on moisture from plants to survive.\nValley of Fire State Park, seen in today's image, is one of the best spots in Nevada to observe these desert dwellers. This park is named for its fiery red sandstone formations that seem to glow under the sun. Beyond its natural beauty, the park holds deep historical significance, with petroglyphs left by ancient Indigenous peoples. It has also earned a place in pop culture as a filming location for scenes from 'Star Trek Generations.'

This fortress has seen it all—battles, power shifts and royal connections. Originally built in the 14th century, the medieval castle was designed to guard the Loire River and control access to the region. Over time, it evolved into a residence for nobility, most notably serving as the home of Maximilien de Béthune, Duke of Sully, who was a trusted minister of King Henry IV. Today, after multiple restorations, the castle welcomes visitors eager to uncover its history. It also stands as an example of French Renaissance architecture.\nMany of the so-called forts in India are castles or fortresses.

Researchers believe that both Galápagos land iguanas and marine iguanas evolved from a common ancestor that likely rafted from Central or South America. They've adapted in remarkable ways, from flattened tails for swimming to salt glands that allow them to expel seawater by sneezing.\nTheir dark colour helps them absorb heat quickly after swimming in the cold waters. These reptiles are not very social; they are often seen sunbathing in groups to conserve heat, especially during cold nights. Visiting the Galápagos Islands is a unique chance to see marine iguanas in their natural home.

The term 'Ides' referred to the midpoint of the month in the Roman calendar, often marking the full moon. It was a time of celebration, with festivals and public gatherings. However, in 44 BCE, the Ides of March became synonymous with political upheaval, betrayal and an event that would trigger the fall of the Roman Republic. On that fateful day, Julius Caesar, Rome's powerful dictator, was assassinated by a group of senators. The conspirators, including his close ally Brutus, believed they were saving the Republic from Caesar's growing authority. Caesar was attacked near the Theatre of Pompey, but the tension of that moment echoed through the Roman Forum—the beating heart of Rome's political and social life.\nStrolling through the Forum, in present-day Italy, you can now see the remnants of history and the ruins of a once-mighty empire. Among its many treasures is the Temple of Saturn, pictured here. One of the Forum's oldest and most revered structures, it once guarded the Roman treasury, a stark symbol of the Republic Caesar's assassins claimed to protect.",

		"description": "In the world of clever hunting, the black heron rules the roost. This bird thrives in shallow, open waters and at the edges of freshwater lakes and ponds. It's also commonly spotted in marshes, rice fields, seasonally flooded grasslands and along riverbanks.\nAt first glance, this feathered genius seems like any other wading bird, with its long legs, slender neck and pointed beak that aid in hunting. But when it hunts, this jet-black African species showcases an extraordinary skill—it takes the shape of an umbrella, as seen in today's image. While fishing, the heron dips its head, extends its wings around its body, and forms a shaded canopy. This clever technique is known as canopy feeding. One common theory is that small fish, seeking cover, are attracted to the shade of the heron's wings and swim right into its trap. The shade acts like polarised sunglasses, reducing glare and improving the heron's vision under the water. Additionally, the heron might also be camouflaging itself, which further intensifies the trap for the fish.",

Celebrated for centuries in art and literature, the daffodil carries cultural significance worldwide, symbolising death, renewal and good fortune. As one of England's most cherished plants, the daffodil has been celebrated by many English writers for its cultural and symbolic significance, making it one of the most poetically revered flowers. From John Gower and Shakespeare to William Wordsworth and John Milton, daffodils have inspired countless verses in literary history.",

First established by the United Nations in 2013, this day encourages worldwide efforts, such as tree-planting campaigns, to raise awareness about the importance of forests and trees for future generations. One of the most breathtaking places to observe the richness of forests is the Danum Valley Conservation Area in Sabah on the Malaysian island of Borneo, starring in today's image. This over 400-square-kilometre sanctuary is home to an ancient, 130-million-year-old rainforest, teeming with rare species like Bornean orangutans, clouded leopards and over 270 bird species.\nBeyond Borneo's landscapes, forests are integral to daily life in countries like India, serving as both an economic pillar and an environmental shield. As one of the top 10 forest-rich countries, India, along with nine others, accounts for 67% of the world's total forest area. Apart from timber and fuel, it has a flourishing non-wood forest products industry, which includes latex, gums, resins, essential oils, fragrances, incense sticks, handicrafts, thatching materials and medicinal plants. Around 60% of these products are consumed locally and non-wood forest products contribute nearly 50% of the sector's total revenue, highlighting their economic and cultural significance.",

These extremely arid regions receive less than 7 centimetres of annual rainfall. Compared to other bush elephants, desert elephants have longer legs, broader feet and slightly smaller bodies. These resilient, herbivorous creatures migrate between waterholes, following ancient routes based on seasonal food and water availability. Male desert elephants often roam alone over vast areas, while female-led family groups stay near rivers, where food is more plentiful. Their incredible adaptability is showcased by their ability to travel long distances, sometimes more than 60 kilometres in a single night, to find their favorite myrrh bushes.\nThe Indian elephant, a subspecies of the Asian elephant, is native to mainland Asia and thrives in grasslands, dry and moist deciduous forests, as well as evergreen and semi-evergreen forests. As a megaherbivore, it consumes up to 150 kilograms of plant matter daily, adapting its diet to the habitat and seasons. Its meals range from fresh leaves, twigs and thorny shoots to flowering plants, fruits and grasses.",

The West Indian manatee, which includes the Florida manatee, can grow up to 4 metres long and weigh over 450 kilograms. These peaceful creatures spend most of their time grazing and napping. They have no natural predators, but human activity poses a major risk. Boat strikes are a leading cause of injury and death, as these marine mammals are too slow to dodge speeding vessels.

Every year, a renowned theatre figure is invited by ITI to deliver a message that resonates across the industry. Their words are translated into more than 50 languages and shared with people all over the world. So, what better place to celebrate today than at the Odeon of Herodes Atticus? Located at the foot of the Acropolis in Athens, Greece, this stone Roman theatre has been setting the scene for performances for nearly two millennia. Built in 161 CE by the wealthy Roman Herodes Atticus in memory of his wife, this ancient venue has hosted everything from classical tragedies to modern-day concerts. Despite the passing centuries, its acoustics still strike the right chord.\nIndian theatre is among the oldest theatrical traditions, dating back to the mid-first millennium BCE. Rich in textual depth, sculptural representation and dramatic expression, it shares a close connection with Indian music and dance. Rooted in the concept of Nritya—a Sanskrit term that blends drama, expressive dance and music—Indian theatre offers a multidimensional performance experience. Over time, its influence has extended beyond the subcontinent, shaping theatrical traditions in ancient China and other parts of the Far East.",

During the breeding season, the female lays two to three eggs in a cosy, cup-shaped nest tucked into a tree fork, as seen in today's image. The nest is woven with filaments of webbing and the Marasmius, a type of mushroom-producing fungus, known for its natural antibiotic properties.

The cave is located near Benagil, a quaint Portuguese village on the Atlantic coast in the municipality of Lagoa. Until the late 20th century, Benagil was a traditional fishing village, with its economy deeply rooted in ocean fishing. Over the years, it has transformed into a thriving tourist destination, thanks in part to its stunning beach, Praia de Benagil. The region, including the Benagil Cave, showcases a perfect harmony of nature's wonders and the charm of Portugal's coastline.",

When the sun is positioned well below the horizon, during this brief window, the lingering sunlight casts a deep blue hue across the sky.\nNaxos is renowned for its deposits of emery, a corundum-rich rock that was once among the finest natural abrasives used before modern alternatives emerged. The most fertile island in the Cyclades, it has a reliable water supply in the region. It is celebrated across Greece for its signature flavours, including the rich Arseniko Naxou cheese, flavourful potatoes, aromatic Kitron liqueur made from local citrus and Naxian honey, primarily sourced from thyme nectar. A sun-soaked island, Naxos is packed with beaches, villages and ancient ruins. Whether you're looking to rest on the sands of beaches like Agia Anna, Agios Prokopios or Plaka, or chase the wind at one of the island's top windsurfing and kitesurfing spots, there's no shortage of adventure here.",

Siblings Day is here—a day to appreciate the ones who stole your toys, tattled on you and yet somehow remain your biggest supporters. Siblings Day has gained recognition across several countries. The idea came from Claudia Evart, who established the day in memory of her late siblings. In India, the bond between siblings is celebrated each year through Raksha Bandhan, a tradition where sisters tie a rakhi—a sacred thread—around their brother's wrist. This heartfelt gesture symbolises love, protection and the deep connection shared between siblings.\nSiblinghood isn't just for humans—it's a big deal in the wild too! Red fox cubs, featured in today's image, take sibling rivalry and teamwork to a whole new level. Cubs are born in an underground den, blind and helpless. Their mother keeps them safe while the father brings food. But as their eyes open and legs strengthen, the real fun begins. Sibling play is essential, shaping their hunting and social skills while keeping things entertaining. Wrestling, pouncing and even playful ambushes are all part of the training. They mimic each other's behaviours, test their boundaries and develop their cunning instincts as a team. So, this Siblings Day, take a lesson from these animals—embrace the chaos, enjoy the fun and maybe let your sibling have the last snack—just this once.",

These beauties arrived in the country in the late 16th century, brought from the Ottoman Empire. By the 17th century, they became so valuable that a single bulb could cost more than a house. This period, known as 'tulip mania,' is considered one of the first recorded financial bubbles. When prices crashed in 1637, fortunes were lost, but the love for tulips remained.\nThe most famous tulip fields, like the one pictured here, are found in regions such as the Bollenstreek (Bulb Region), just outside Amsterdam. Rows of red, yellow, pink and purple stretch as far as the eye can see. Then there's Keukenhof, in Lisse, the world's most famous flower park, open only for a few weeks each spring. It showcases over seven million bulbs, including rare and exotic tulip varieties. The designs change every year, so no two visits are ever the same. If you miss the bloom, don't worry—the Netherlands keeps its tulip industry thriving year-round. The Dutch take their tulips seriously, and nowhere is this more evident than at the Aalsmeer Flower Auction, the largest flower market in the world. Here, millions of flowers, including tulips, are bought and sold daily, making their way to homes across the globe.",

Then, on April 12, 1961, one man left the planet and changed history forever. That morning, Soviet pilot Yuri Gagarin climbed into a small, spherical spacecraft named Vostok 1. The countdown began. The engines ignited. As the rocket roared toward the sky, he called out, 'Poyekhali!'—'Let's go!' And just like that, Earth had its first space traveller.\nFor 108 minutes, Gagarin orbited the planet, watching the world from a view no human had ever seen before. When he landed safely back on Earth, everything had changed. Humanity had entered the Space Age. His flight sparked the race to the Moon, the dream of living on Mars and much more. Decades later, in honour of his achievement, the United Nations declared April 12 as the International Day of Human Space Flight. Pictured here is the view from the cupola of the International Space Station, showing the vast South Pacific Ocean. It is a reminder of how small Earth is in the grand cosmos—and how far human spaceflight has taken us.",

Thailand's Songkran festival is a unique mix of spiritual traditions and all-out water fights. Held from April 13 to 15 this year, the holiday is deeply rooted in Buddhist customs and focuses on cleansing and starting afresh. During this time, people visit temples, offer food to monks and pour scented water over Buddha statues and elders' hands as a sign of respect. Those seeking a calmer way to celebrate might consider visiting Wat Tang Sai Temple in Ban Krut, seen in today's image. Perched on Thong Chai Mountain, this temple complex is home to an over 10-metre-tall Buddha statue and Thai-style pagodas. Built in 1996 to honour King Bhumibol Adulyadej (Rama IX) on his 50th year of reign (1946–2016), it remains an important spiritual site. With stunning coastline views, Wat Tang Sai offers a peaceful setting to meditate and feel the vibrations of Buddhist chants.\nInterestingly, around the same time, India celebrates Vaisakhi, a festival that also signifies a fresh start—though in a different way. Marking the beginning of the month of Vaisakh, Vaisakhi is primarily observed in Punjab and Northern India as a vibrant spring harvest festival. Celebrated annually on April 13 and occasionally on April 14, it carries cultural significance beyond agriculture, aligning with the Indian Solar New Year in several regions.",

Established by the International Association of Art in honour of Leonardo da Vinci's birthday, this global celebration promotes creativity in all its forms. Art has been a cornerstone of human civilisation for thousands of years, from prehistoric cave paintings to digital masterpieces. Beyond the sculptures and paintings found in galleries and museums, art also lives in street murals, sand sculptures and even beach art, as seen here, proving that creativity knows no bounds. World Art Day, officially observed in 21 countries, is a celebration for everyone, whether you're a collector, a creator or simply someone who finds joy in the colors and textures of everyday life.\nSo, take a moment today to embrace creativity—visit a local gallery, sketch in a notebook or pause to appreciate the artistry that surrounds you. Among the world's many artistic traditions, Indian art stands out as a rich tapestry of diverse forms, including painting, sculpture, pottery and textile arts like woven silk. Spanning the subcontinent, it encompasses regions that are now India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan and, at times, eastern Afghanistan. Whether in its traditional or modern expressions, Indian art is distinguished by a strong sense of design that unites its many styles.",

Shaped by the relentless forces of wind and water, this monument features three magnificent natural bridges—Sipapu, Kachina and Owachomo. These bridges were named to honour the Ancestral Puebloans who once lived here. Sipapu is the largest bridge, with a massive opening that could almost fit the dome of the United States Capitol. Kachina, pictured here, is equidistant from Sipapu and Owachomo. It was named after the petroglyphs and pictographs found at its base. Owachomo is believed to be the oldest of the three. Its thin, arching structure suggests it may eventually collapse.\nRecognising the significance of these natural wonders, President Theodore Roosevelt designated Natural Bridges as Utah's first national monument in 1908. Today, it remains a place of awe and solitude, where visitors can hike beneath the soaring bridges, gaze at some of the darkest night skies in the country, and step back into a landscape sculpted over millions of years.",

With its bold colours, this native South American bird isn't just about looks—it's got the moves too.\nThe Andean and Guianan cock-of-the-rock are renowned for their theatrical courtship dances, making them true head-turners of the feathered kingdom. Females are far less flashy, with brownish feathers that help them stay hidden. During the mating season, males gather in leks—noisy display arenas—where they hop, squawk and shake their heads in an effort to impress a female. She watches, picks the best dancer, mates and then flies off to build a concave, cup-shaped mud nest on a rocky surface. The female typically lays two white eggs and incubates them for 25 to 28 days, raising the chicks on her own. The Andean cock-of-the-rock thrives in the cloud forests of the Andes, favouring dense, fruit-rich areas in Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia. As a frugivore, it primarily eats fruit and helps spread seeds throughout its habitat. It occasionally consumes insects and small vertebrates.",

The eastern prairie fringed orchid brightens the trails, and ancient cedar trees cling to the rocky edges, seemingly defying gravity. Then there's the famed Grotto, situated on the shore between the Marr Lake and Georgian Bay trails. This stunning limestone cave, with its glowing blue waters, is worth every step of the hike. Whether you're here for the views, the wildlife or a refreshing dip in Georgian Bay, this park offers an unforgettable escape.",

The redwood groves of Redwood National and State Parks (RNSP) in California, United States, are home to some of the tallest trees on Earth, soaring over 110 metres high. The combined RNSP contain Redwood National Park, Del Norte Coast Redwoods State Park, Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park and Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park. Some of these redwoods were alive when the Mayans built their temples, and the Great Wall of China was under construction. Protected since 1968, the park preserves nearly half of the world's remaining old-growth redwoods.\nWalk through Stout Grove in Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park or Lady Bird Johnson Grove in Redwood National Park for a quiet stroll among the redwoods. You can also hike the Tall Trees Trail, a permit-only path where you can closely witness the tallest trees. The RNSP ecosystem is home to many animals, including Roosevelt elk, black bears, banana slugs and the endangered marbled murrelets. Ferns and moss thrive beneath the leafy canopy, while coastal fog provides essential moisture to the trees. Whether hiking beneath these towering giants or simply standing in their shadows, the experience is humbling.",

		"description": "Here's a place where the wild rules and nature moves at its own pace. Moremi Game Reserve stretches across the eastern side of Botswana's Okavango Delta, covering over 4,900 square kilometres. Established in 1963, it became Africa's first reserve created by local people—the Batawana, a Bantu ethnic group native to Southern Africa—to protect the region's wildlife from uncontrolled hunting. The combination of permanent water and dry land makes it one of the best places in Africa to observe wildlife in its natural habitat.\nOne animal you're almost certain to spot is the impala. These medium-sized antelopes are active mainly during the day. Males fight fiercely for dominance during the breeding season, or rut, locking horns in dramatic battles. After a six-month gestation period, females give birth to a single fawn. Outside the mating season, they stick together in herds—the territorial males, bachelor herds and female herds—always on the lookout for predators. When danger strikes, they freeze, only to explode into a sprint when the moment demands. They can leap more than 3 metres high, cover over 5 metres in a single bound and change direction mid-sprint. Whether grazing quietly or launching into a sudden dash, impalas are among Moremi's most adaptable residents.",

While the Loire Valley in France is packed with stunning châteaux (French for castles), Villandry stands apart, not for its towering turrets or medieval might, but for its gardens. Built in the 16th century by Jean le Breton, a minister to King Francis I, Villandry was always meant to impress. Unlike fortified castles built for war, it was designed for comfort, featuring large windows and an open, welcoming layout. Its gardens are arranged across terraces with distinct themes. The ornamental garden showcases geometric patterns like the one pictured here. The water garden offers a serene retreat, and the vegetable garden turns everyday crops into artistic displays.\nJantar Mantar in New Delhi embodies our quest to understand the cosmos. The term means 'instruments for measuring the harmony of the heavens' and is a striking collection of 13 architectural astronomy instruments. Built by Maharaja Jai Singh II of Jaipur from 1723 onward, this observatory played a crucial role in refining astronomical tables and predicting celestial movements. Designed to track the sun, moon and planets, its purpose aligns with what is now considered modern astronomy.",

This music form emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in New Orleans, a city alive with musical traditions from Africa, Europe and the Caribbean.\nToday, jazz is everywhere—from Brazilian bossa nova to Ethiopian Ethio-jazz, proving that a good groove knows no borders. It found its way to India in the 1920s, taking root in Mumbai and Kolkata as African American musicians introduced the genre to local audiences. Their performances captivated Goan musicians, who blended jazz influences into India's evolving Hindi film music. The jazz scene remains vibrant in cities like Mumbai, Pune, Delhi, Goa and Kolkata, keeping the spirit of this musica fusion alive.

The bridge initially opened to the public with four lanes on June 30, 2009, while all eight lanes became fully operational by March 24, 2010. By providing a faster alternative to the congested roads, the sea link cuts down peak-hour travel time between Bandra and Worli from 20–30 minutes to just 10 minutes, making commutes significantly smoother. As vehicles glide over its expanse, the bridge connects dreams, ambition and the unstoppable spirit of the state.",

The family's fortunes declined after the Battle of the Boyne in 1690, and with little money for upkeep, the castle gradually fell into ruin.\nDunluce Castle is steeped in legend, including the tale of its banshee. Maeve Roe, the only daughter of Lord MacQuillan, defied an arranged marriage and was locked away in the castle's turret. One night, as Maeve Roe and her lover fled by boat, a fierce storm struck, dragging them both to a watery grave. Locals say her ghostly cries still echo from the turret. Today, visitors can explore the windswept remains of this medieval fortress, imagining the feasts and battles that once took place here.

World Donkey Day, established by Dr. Abdul Raziq Kakar, a livestock expert from Pakistan, is all about celebrating these hardworking animals. Donkeys have a reputation for being stubborn, but that's just a misunderstanding. They're cautious thinkers. Unlike horses, which might bolt at danger, donkeys take a moment to assess the situation before reacting. From ancient trade routes to modern farms, donkeys have been essential to transportation and agriculture. In many parts of the world, they're still the backbone of rural economies, carrying supplies across difficult terrain where vehicles can't go. Despite their vital role, donkeys face serious challenges. Many endure overwork, poor treatment and abandonment.\nIndia's donkey population is in sharp decline, plummeting by 61% in just seven years. From 3.2 lakh in 2012 to a mere 1.2 lakh by 2019, this significant drop—as recorded in the last two livestock censuses—paints a worrying picture for a species long considered the humble workhorse of rural India.

This bond extends beyond infancy, as mothers continue to nurture and support their young even after weaning. Leopard mothers share territory with their cubs, providing protection and guidance as they grow. At around nine weeks, cubs begin eating meat, and by three months they start joining hunts, learning essential survival skills. By their first year, they can fend for themselves, but they typically stay with their mother for up to two years before venturing out on their own. In times of scarcity, mothers have been known to share their kills, ensuring their cubs remain nourished and strong.

The iris is a flowering plant genus that has 310 recognised species, known for their bold and beautiful blossoms. The genus is named after the Greek word 'îris', meaning 'rainbow,' which is also the name of the Greek goddess of rainbows. During the Edo Period (1603-1867), a fascination with breeding Japanese irises led to an explosion of new varieties. Today, there are over 2,000 types, which are planted in March and nurtured by tsuyu, Japan's rainy season.

Its most recognisable feature—the three massive granite peaks known as the Torres—stands over 2,400 metres tall. These formations took shape through magma intrusion and uplift, followed by millions of years of glacial erosion, leaving behind the jagged spires seen today.\nThe park's lakes and rivers, fueled by melting ice, create a hydrological network that sustains its wildlife. Four major glaciers—Tyndall, Grey, Dickson and Zapata—are fed by the Southern Patagonian Ice Field. Originating from Dickson Lake, the Paine River flows through various bodies of water, including Paine Lake, Nordenskjöld Lake and Pehoé Lake.

Lead, zinc, coal, sulfur, barium and silver were extracted from these rugged hills but transporting them was a logistical nightmare. In 1924, Italian engineer Cesare Vecelli revolutionised ore transport in the region. He designed Porto Flavia as a system of tunnels and silos carved into a limestone cliff, allowing ore to be loaded directly onto cargo ships. The port, named after Vecelli's daughter, Flavia, remained in use until mining declined in the mid-20th century.\nOn the eastern coast of India, the city of Visakhapatnam tells a similar story of maritime legacy, though shaped by different forces. It is the largest and most populous metropolitan city in Andhra Pradesh. Once known as Vizagapatam, this coastal hub has a rich maritime legacy that dates to ancient times. It served as a significant port city, with historical trade links stretching as far as the Middle East and Rome. In those early days, ships would anchor offshore, while goods were ferried to and from the coastline using traditional masula boats.",

		"description": "London's most famous clock tower isn't called Big Ben—that name belongs to the massive over 12,000 kilograms bell inside. It has marked time for Londoners since 1859, ringing from what is now known as the Elizabeth Tower. In 2012, officials renamed the Clock Tower as Elizabeth Tower to honour Queen Elizabeth II during her Diamond Jubilee. The clock has stopped only for maintenance and rare disruptions, such as bomb damage during World Wars I and II. Each of its four clock faces spans more than 6 metres, with the minute hands measuring over 4 metres. At more than 90 metre tall, the tower is part of the grand Palace of Westminster, home to the UK Parliament.\nFor centuries, the Palace of Westminster has stood at the heart of British politics. Originally built by Edward the Confessor in the 11th century, the palace has hosted Parliament since the 13th century. Previously a royal residence, it remained one until a fire in 1512 forced Henry VIII to relocate. A second devastating fire in 1834 destroyed most of the medieval complex, leading to the Gothic Revival design seen today. Architect Charles Barry led the reconstruction, while his assistant, Augustus Pugin, designed the intricate details. Covering an area of 1,12,476 square metres, the palace houses the House of Commons, the House of Lords and Westminster Hall, which dates back to 1097.",

Rising five storeys high, this architectural gem resembles a beehive from afar, with its lattice of tiny windows and ornate jharokhas. Step closer, and you'll discover a design that is brilliantly functional. Thanks to over 900 openings, the air flows freely, creating a constant, cooling breeze. Hence, the name translates to 'Palace of the Winds.' In 1799, Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, the grandson of Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh, commissioned the creation of this remarkable structure. The architect behind its design was Lal Chand Ustad.\nThis palace was built with royal women in mind, offering them the freedom to witness life on the vibrant Johari Bazaar streets below. What truly sets this monument apart, though, is its bold engineering. It is the tallest building of its kind in the world without a foundation—without solid base, yet it's stood firm for centuries.

Alongside butterflies, bats and hummingbirds, bees pollinate nearly 90% of the world's wild flowering plants and over 35% of the food crops we rely on. World Bee Day, marked every May 20, honours these vital pollinators and celebrates Anton Janša, a pioneer of modern beekeeping. Janša saw bees as the noblest of insects, an idea now backed by science.\nUnfortunately, bee populations are in danger. Pesticide exposure, habitat loss and climate change are driving their numbers down, threatening both global food security and biodiversity. The good news is that small actions can make a big difference. Support local beekeepers, plant pollinator-friendly flowers and avoid chemical pesticides.

Biodiversity ties into everything, from sustainable farming and clean water to climate action and disaster preparedness. India is one of the world's most biodiverse countries, home to nearly 10% of global species. Its ecological wealth is deeply woven into its culture, shaped over thousands of years. But this delicate balance is under threat—from rising populations and climate change to weak enforcement of environmental laws. As species edge toward extinction, it's not just the natural food chain that suffers, but also the livelihoods and traditions of millions who rely on this biodiversity to sustain their way of life.\nToday's image features Madagascar's Avenue of the Baobabs. In the Menabe region of western Madagascar, Grandidier's baobabs line the unpaved Road No. 8. Also known as giant baobabs, they are the largest and most famous of Madagascar's baobab species. Locally known as renala or reniala ('mother of the forest'), these trees are remnants of the lush tropical forests that once covered this island country. Now, they stand alone as survivors of widespread deforestation.

Before contributing, please take a moment to review the observation guidelines.\nHere we see a fascinating Amazonian phenomenon—a Julia butterfly on the nose of a yellow-spotted river turtle in Ecuador's Amazon River region. Butterflies in the Amazon are known to sip the tears of turtles, which provide a vital source of sodium, a mineral in short supply. The yellow-spotted river turtle is one of the largest river turtles in South America. While these turtles are well-adapted to the waters, they face a range of threats from humans, birds, snakes, large fish, frogs and mammals. In the 1960s, they were heavily exploited for the American pet trade, leading to strict regulations on their importation.

In fact, the concept of stepwells dates all the way back to the Indus Valley Civilisation, with ancient sites like Dholavira showcasing some of the earliest examples of this ingenious way to manage water in arid climates.\nWhile many of these ancient structures are scattered across India, one example stands right in the heart of New Delhi. Agrasen Ki Baoli, featured here, offers a surprising pocket of calm. This 60-metre-long, 15-metre-wide stepwell is believed to have been built by the Aggarwal community in honour of their ancestor, Agrasen, though no official records confirm it. With 108 stone steps and three visible levels lined with arched niches, this baoli is a rare sight in the capital.

But it doesn't have to be that way. On World Otter Day—the last Wednesday of May—let's shine a light on the challenges these lovable mammals face and help protect their place in the wild.\nOtters belong to the Mustelidae family, a diverse group that includes weasels, badgers and minks, and are found on every continent except Australia and Antarctica. With 13 species worldwide, including the European otter, giant otter and sea otter—pictured here—these semi-aquatic animals are adapted for life in water. Their webbed feet, dense fur and strong tails make them excellent swimmers. Beyond their cuteness, otters play a vital role in ecosystems. India is home to three of the world's 13 otter species—the smooth-coated, Eurasian and small-clawed otters. While the smooth-coated otter is found across the country, the other two are limited to the Himalayas, northern Ganges and southern India.

That's the Little Pigeon River, threading its way through the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee, United States. Long before tourists tubed it and fly fishers praised it, this river was how people stayed afloat. The Cherokee tribe fished in it. Settlers built grist mills along it. Towns like Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge grew up with it. Even the river's name is a nod to the past—the passenger pigeon, once common in the area, vanished by the early 1900s. The West, Middle and East prongs come together to form a system that cuts through the Smokies and flows into the Pigeon River. Trails like the Gatlinburg Trail run alongside the river, offering flat paths with water views and shady rest spots. Some hikes, like the Ramsey Cascades trail, follow the river deeper into the park and reward you with impressive waterfalls.\nAnother driver quietly charts its course across a very different landscape. The Bhadar River winds its way through the Saurashtra peninsula in western Gujarat. Starting near Jasdan, it flows southward before veering southwest and continuing westward, eventually meeting the Arabian Sea close to Porbandar.

At over 1,400 kilometres long, it's one of the longest continuous barrier reefs in the world.\nIndia's coral reefs are among the country's oldest and most vibrant ecosystems, offering shelter to diverse marine species while acting as natural barriers that shield coastlines from erosion. These reefs are primarily found in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Gulf of Mannar, Gulf of Kutch, Palk Strait and Lakshadweep. While most are fringing reefs, the Lakshadweep reefs are distinct atolls. Additionally, patchy coral formations can be seen along the intertidal zones of the central west coast, including areas like Ratnagiri and Gaveshani Bank.",

		"description": "For decades, voices across Telangana echoed with the hope of identity and self-governance. Once part of the Telugu-speaking Hyderabad princely state, the region was merged with Andhra Pradesh in 1956. What followed was one of South India's longest statehood movements. After years of protests and political pushback, the dream became a reality on 2 June 2014. Telangana Day now honours that hard-won journey—a story of resilience, separation and a future reclaimed.\nThat future now takes visible form in the heart of Hyderabad. The new Telangana Secretariat is not just an administrative hub, but also a statement of vision and values. Officially named the Dr. B. R. Ambedkar Telangana State Secretariat, this grand complex pays tribute to the architect of the Indian Constitution. Designed by Chennai-based architects Ponni and Oscar Concessao and built by Shapoorji Pallonji, it blends modern governance with sustainable design. Towering beside it, a 38-metre statue of Ambedkar watches over—a symbol of justice, dignity and progress.",

		"description": "Two wheels, no fuel and a whole lot of purpose—cycling is affordable, eco-friendly and easy on the planet. Something as simple as cycling can significantly boost your health, and swapping the car for a bicycle is an easy way to stay active. Moreover, cycling helps reduce pollution, eases traffic congestion and offers an affordable transport option for those without access to cars. Because of all these benefits, the United Nations dedicated June 3 as World Bicycle Day—a day to celebrate everything this amazing two-wheeler stands for.\nIf there's one place that brings the cycling spirit to life, it's the Netherlands. Today's image captures bicycles lined up on a bridge in Utrecht. More than half the journeys around the city happen on bikes, surpassing cars and other transport options. Nearly everyone lives within 15 minutes of essentials—and over 90% can reach key places in just 10. This wasn't always the case. It was only in the 1970s, sparked by an oil crisis, rising car-related issues and strong social movements, that the country started prioritising bikes over cars. Since then, cities have embraced bike-friendly streets, dedicated lanes and traffic lights for cyclists. And thanks to the famously flat landscape, cycling here feels as natural as walking.",

On the island's eastern coast lies Cala Luna, featured here—a beach in the Gulf of Orosei. Rising at the mouth of Rio Illune, this beach is at the end of the Codula di Luna canyon. It is a haven of golden sand, surrounded by white cliffs that rise more than 250 metres into the sky—perfect for rock climbing. Here, the waters are shallow at first, before deepening into crystal-clear depths ideal for snorkelling, diving and fishing. In the local Nuoro dialect, the word for 'Luna,' meaning 'moon', is rendered as 'elune,' a name that perfectly captures the essence of this enchanting cove. Adding to the mystique, the beach's crescent shape echoes its lunar inspiration. For centuries, shepherds from the village of Baunei would embark on an eight-hour walk to reach this secluded spot, considering it a journey as far as the moon itself.\nStretching along the Bay of Bengal, Marina Beach in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, is a natural urban coastline renowned for its length and cultural significance. Extending from Fort St. George in the north to Foreshore Estate in the south, the beach spans approximately 6 kilometres, making it one of the longest urban beaches in the world. Known for its broad, sandy expanse—averaging 300 metres in width and reaching up to 437 metres at its widest—the Marina is a major city landmark.",

Led by the United Nations Environment Programme, this day has been observed annually on June 5 since 1973. This year, hosted by the Republic of Korea, the event focuses on ending plastic pollution. Plastic contamination has crept into every part of the world—from oceans and forests to our own bodies in the form of microplastics. This year's campaign aims to spark change at every level of society.\nAnd that brings us to today's image, a mural that's turning heads and making a difference in Guatire, Venezuela. A local artist, Oscar Olivares, created one of the world's largest eco-murals—made entirely from plastic bottle caps. The over 350-square-metre artwork is made of 400,000 bottle caps and depicts two blue macaws spreading their wings across a once-plain cement wall. Children, seniors and everyone in between rolled up their sleeves to glue caps, piece by piece, converting waste into something meaningful. Through this project, Olivares not only crafted something beautiful, but also sparked conversations about sustainability and showed people the power of collective action. Because sometimes, a big change starts with something as small as a bottle cap.",

On June 6, 1944, over 156,000 Allied troops landed on the beaches of Normandy, France, launching Operation Overlord, also known as D-Day. This complex assault, involving coordinated air, sea and land forces, marked the beginning of the campaign to liberate Western Europe from Nazi control.\nOne of the key sites was Arromanches-les-Bains, pictured here. Though not among the initial landing beaches, this quiet coastal town became vital in the days that followed. It was here that the Allies built Mulberry harbour B, a massive, temporary port assembled in record time to offload troops, vehicles and supplies. In the months after D-Day, more than 2.5 million men and 500,000 vehicles landed at Arromanches. Remnants of the harbour still lie offshore, a symbol of the ingenuity and planning behind the operation. Arromanches is also home to the Musée du Débarquement, the first museum dedicated to D-Day and the Battle of Normandy, a place where history lives on through stories of courage and resilience.",

In 1156 CE, he built an artificial lake to meet the water needs of the city's inhabitants. Thus, came into being the Gadsisar Rainwater Lake, originally named Jaisalasar Lake after its creator, Rawal Jaisal. In the 14th century, Maharawal Gadsi Singh rebuilt the lake, and it was renamed in his honour—marking a new chapter in its enduring legacy.\nLocated just 1.5 kilometres from Jaisalmer Fort, this lake became the city's water source for generations. Today, fed by the Indira Gandhi Canal, the waters of this historic lake flow endlessly, ensuring it never dries and continuing to sustain the legacy of those who dreamed of a thriving oasis. The lake is surrounded by small temples and chattris—cenotaphs dedicated to the region's most revered figures. A boat ride offers an intimate view of these ancient structures. As evening falls, the lake becomes a canvas for the setting sun, with golden hues shimmering across the water, creating a magical, unforgettable atmosphere.",

This year's theme is 'WONDER: Sustaining What Sustains Us'. It highlights how the ocean supports life as we know it—influencing weather, food chains and economies.\nOff the coast of Vancouver Island in Canada, Steller sea lions glide through chilly waters, as seen in today's image. These marine mammals are heavy—females average 260 kilograms, while males are more than 500 kilograms. Males are noticeably larger than females and are known for their loud roars, thick necks and flatter snouts. Their deep vocalisations include belching, growling and snorting to warn others and communicate underwater. Males get loud to defend turf, while moms and pups use unique calls to find each other in a crowded rookery. Despite their size, they're preyed on by orcas and large sharks. These sea lions are considered near-threatened, with populations declining in parts of Alaska. Ocean conservation keeps them—and countless other mammals—afloat.",

		"description": "There is something mesmerising about cities that wear their history on their sleeves—and Dubrovnik, Croatia, is one of them. Once known as the independent Republic of Ragusa, this city was a major maritime power and trading hub from the 14th to the 19th century. Situated in southern Dalmatia along the Adriatic Sea, its success was built on diplomacy and seafaring. The Walls of Dubrovnik, built between the 13th and 17th centuries, stretch close to 2 kilometres, with towers, forts and bastions still standing strong. The current layout of the walls follows a city plan from 1292, when Dubrovnik was rebuilt after a fire under Venetian rule.\nInside these walls is the Old City—a compact grid of polished limestone streets, baroque churches and centuries-old residences. Everything here, including the 15th-century Rector's Palace, Sponza Palace and the Church of St. Blaise, reflects the city's independent past. The Franciscan Monastery, Europe's oldest still operating pharmacy, adds another layer of charm to this vintage place. Dubrovnik might seem familiar. That's because it has represented the cities of King's Landing and Qarth in 'Game of Thrones', putting it on the pop culture map. It's not just a touristy location—it's a city that has been writing its own script for over a thousand years.",

Everglades National Park, located in Florida, is the largest tropical wilderness in the United States, spanning more than 6,000 square kilometres. It protects the southern 20% of the original Everglades and is home to numerous rare and endangered species, including the Florida panther, American crocodile and West Indian manatee. Often referred to as 'River of Grass,' the park's unique ecosystem, fed by a slow-moving river from Lake Okeechobee to Florida Bay, is a significant breeding ground for tropical wading birds. The park also plays a crucial role in water conservation and flood control, as its wetlands serve as natural filters and buffers against storms.\nPeriyar National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary, located in Kerala's Idukki and Pathanamthitta districts, is one of the country’s most prominent wildlife reserves. Famous for its elephant and tiger populations, the sanctuary covers 925 square kilometres, with 350.54 square kilometres designated as a national park in 1982.

These long-legged locals, the greater flamingos, bring a splash of pink to Namibia's windswept Atlantic coast. These birds are the largest of their kind, and they're not shy about showing off. Towering over 120 centimetres tall with spoon-shaped bills and stilt-like legs, they're easy to spot. That bubblegum pink hue? That's all diet. Flamingos feed on algae, crustaceans and tiny invertebrates packed with carotenoids—the same pigments that make carrots orange. The more they eat, the pinker they get. In other words, they're what they eat, right down to the blush. In the air, flamingos are sleek flyers, cruising long distances in a V-formation. Their migration habits are still being studied, but it's clear they go where the wetlands flow—from inland salt pans to coastal sanctuaries, always in search of food and safe nesting zones.\nCome winter, their journey often leads them to India, where a warm welcome awaits. Chilika Lake, the country's largest coastal lagoon, becomes a seasonal haven for these elegant visitors. But Chilika isn't alone, flamingos also find refuge in places like the Sewri Mudflats in Mumbai, Bhigwan in Maharashtra, Pulicat Lake (straddling Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu), the Kutch salt flats in Gujarat and the Thane Creek Flamingo Sanctuary.",

Efforts to preserve its beauty began in the 1930s, culminating in its official designation as a park on June 12, 1944. Big Bend remains one of the most remote and least-visited national parks in the country. It's not just one landscape, it's three: the Chihuahuan Desert, the Chisos Mountains (pictured here) and the Rio Grande. Big Bend sits on the United States–Mexico border, and its history reflects that blend. Indigenous peoples, Spanish explorers, ranchers, miners and modern travellers have all left their footprints. Petroglyphs, ruins and old trails show the land's story began long before it became a park.\nThe park is home to over 1,200 species of plants, more than 450 species of birds and a wide variety of mammals, reptiles and amphibians. You might spot a roadrunner zipping across the dirt, or a bobcat silently slipping through the underbrush.

In 1907, Grace Clayton, who lost her father in the Monongah mining disaster, suggested a service to honour fathers who died in the incident. Although the idea didn't gain traction initially, it was revived in 1909 by Sonora Smart Dodd of Spokane. She sought to pay tribute to her father, a Civil War veteran who raised six children alone. Her determination sparked a movement, laying the foundation for the day we now dedicate to dads.\nIn the spirit of Father's Day, featured here is a lesser male rhea, also known as Darwin's rhea, with his chicks in the Torres del Paine National Park, Patagonia, Chile. A male lesser rhea mates with several females and leads them to a shared nest, where they lay eggs in succession before leaving and returning periodically to add more. From the moment his chicks hatch, the male lesser rhea takes full charge—guiding them through the brush, communicating with gentle whistles and sheltering them under his wings in times of danger or cold. Remarkably, he often adopts lost chicks, raising a mixed-age brood. For nearly six months, he teaches and protects them, with many staying close until maturity.

His work laid the foundation for understanding turtle behaviour and fighting for their protection. There are seven species of sea turtles gliding through the world's oceans: green, loggerhead, hawksbill, leatherback, Kemp's ridley, olive ridley and flatback. Most of them are either endangered or vulnerable.\nBeyond supporting thriving fishing grounds, Indian coastal waters and beaches also serve as vital feeding and nesting areas for a range of marine species — including sea turtles. The coastal regions and islands are home to five sea turtle species: the Olive Ridley, Green, Hawksbill, Loggerhead and Leatherback turtles.

Welcome to the maritime forest of Cumberland Island National Seashore on the southernmost stretch of Georgia's Atlantic coast. Salt spray, sandy soil, hurricanes? The trees here stand their ground. Live oaks bend but don't break. Saw palmettos crowd the ground like leafy bodyguards, while Spanish moss hangs from branches like nature's fringe. This maritime forest is one of the best remaining examples of this rare habitat in the United States. Thanks to its national seashore status, the island has been spared from the concrete creep seen on other coastlines.\nWhat you see here is the forest as it's been for centuries—a few ruins from the days of Scottish American industrialist Thomas Carnegie and the occasional feral horses grazing through. The horses are descendants of animals left by settlers long gone, and they're now unofficial mascots of the area. Alongside them, you might spot armadillos digging through the undergrowth, woodpeckers hammering tree trunks, or raccoons engaging in tiny heists. Trails like the South End Trail or the Parallel Trail weave through dense foliage, sometimes giving glimpses of marshes or hidden historic sites. So next time you think of the coast, remember: the real drama isn't always on the shore. Sometimes, it's rooted just beyond the dunes.",

		"description": "Featured here is the Asian swallowtail, beautifully captured on a red spider lily. Found across Northeast Asia and even parts of Hawaii, this striking butterfly uses its keen colour vision to find flowers, especially those from citrus families. These butterflies mate multiple times over the course of their lives, which contributes to greater genetic diversity among their offspring. During the breeding season, males use a combination of physical displays and visual cues to attract potential mates.\nFemales, in turn, often mate with several partners. Once mating is complete, they choose egg-laying sites based on habitat quality and food availability. As egg-laying approaches, female butterflies disperse across the landscape, guided by specific environmental signals. Their decisions on how many eggs to deposit in a given area depend on several factors: the condition of the habitat, the number of adult butterflies present, the availability of young leaves, levels of sunlight (with a preference for sunnier spots) and the height of host plants.",

Besides Kenya and Uganda, they roam the vast plains of Tanzania's Serengeti, a name derived from the Maasai word 'seringit,' meaning 'endless plains.' Today's image captures a tender moment between a Masai giraffe mother and her calf in this stunning landscape. The Masai giraffe is easily recognised by its jagged, irregular spots and inhabits various regions across eastern Africa. It is the largest giraffe species and the tallest land animal on Earth. Males typically weigh up to 1,300 kilograms and can reach heights of 5.5 metres. In the wild, they live around 30 years, often longer in captivity. A notable feature is its long neck, made up of seven vertebrae, which accounts for about one-third of its total height.",

Visitors can walk behind the falls into a small cave, offering a unique perspective and making it a favourite spot for photographers. Floodlights illuminate the waterfall at night, creating a magical scene.\nKunchikal Falls is a majestic waterfall located in Nidagodu village near Masthikatte, in the Shimoga district of Karnataka in India. Formed by the Varahi River, the waterfall cascades over a series of rugged rock formations, creating a stunning, multi-tiered drop. According to the World Waterfall Database, Kunchikal Falls has a total height of 455 metres, making it the tallest waterfall in India.

With its roots in ancient India, yoga has long been a go-to for finding balance—both in body and mind. And it's not just a personal practice anymore. In 2014, the United Nations decided it was worth honouring globally, officially marking 21 June as the International Day of Yoga, a global nod to this age-old path to wellness.\nOne of the places where the spirit of yoga comes alive in every corner is Rishikesh in Uttarakhand, often called the 'Yoga Capital of the World.' Among the city's many landmarks is Lakshman Jhula, once the crossing for locals, pilgrims and selfie-takers alike. This suspension bridge stretches across the Ganges, blending natural beauty with spiritual energy. It connected the villages of Tapovan and Jonk—two sides of the river in two different districts.

Established in 2017 by Rainforest Partnership—a nonprofit environmental organisation—the day raises awareness about the importance of rainforests and mobilises efforts to protect them. In the US, the occasion is marked with community tree- plantings, school projects and social media campaigns that highlight conservation successes. Many botanical gardens host special exhibits, while environmental groups run fundraising challenges to support on-the-ground protection efforts.\nOne notable region of the Amazon rainforest is in Ecuador. Although smaller than Brazil's share, it's considered one of the most biologically dense areas on Earth. It also shelters an extraordinary range of life—jaguars, macaws, black caimans, electric eels and medicinal plants, many still unknown to science. This part of the rainforest is home to Indigenous groups, including uncontacted tribes whose territories are legally protected. But their way of life is increasingly threatened by industrial activities, especially oil drilling. World Rainforest Day reminds us that the protection of rainforests is possible through personal choices and collective action. From reducing paper use to supporting rainforest-friendly products, people can make tangible impacts that reach Ecuador's Amazon and beyond.",

What you see at Arches National Park, Utah, United States, is the result of over 300 million years of erosion, uplift and weathering. These arches were formed when salt beds were left behind by ancient seas. Over time, layers of sandstone cracked, shifted and slowly wore away, revealing more than 2,000 natural arches. These formations are made mostly of Entrada and Navajo sandstone. The park was recognised as a national monument in 1929 and was later upgraded to national park status in 1971.\nDelicate Arch, in Arches National Park, is one of the most recognisable natural arches in the American Southwest. Originally known by several other names—including 'the Chaps' and 'Salt Wash Arch'—it wasn't officially called Delicate Arch until the 1930s, after a scientific expedition described it as 'delicate-looking.' It is Utah's unofficial mascot, appearing on everything from state license plates to a United States postage stamp issued in 1996 to mark 100 years of Utah statehood. The arch is accessible via a moderately difficult hike that climbs over slickrock and skirts steep drop-offs.

The splendid leaf frog, or splendid treefrog, is a rainforest resident with a flair for the dramatic: neon legs, sticky feet and a disappearing act. One minute it's a humble green leaf, the next it's a flash of colour mid-leap, startling predators. This frog lives high in the canopies of Central and South America, especially in Costa Rica, Panama and parts of Ecuador and Colombia. With vertical pupils and a golden glow, its oversized eyes help this frog spot prey in the dark. Thanks to sticky toe pads and strong limbs, it can cling to branches and leaves like a pro, even in the canopy's slippery heights. Breeding season gets creative. Females lay their eggs on leaves overhanging small pools or puddles. Once the eggs hatch, the tadpoles drop into the water below—no parental supervision required.\nJust as the splendid leaf frog steals the show in the rainforests of the Americas, an equally eye-catching star leaps through the streams of India's Western Ghats. The elegant dancing frog belongs to the Micrixalidae family and is a true native of this lush mountain range. Its appearance is just as striking as its name—its head and upper body sport a rich reddish-brown tone dotted with irregular yellow-grey spots, while the sides are shaded in deep black-brown. Adding to its unique look, its hind legs are marked with distinct dark brown bands.",

Fed up with years of harassment, LGBTQIA+ patrons fought back. What followed was six days of unrest—and the start of a movement. Led in part by trans activists like Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, the uprising challenged not only police brutality but society's silence. Stonewall wasn't the beginning of queer existence, but it was the moment people said 'no more' loud enough to be heard worldwide. Today, Stonewall stands as a symbol of resilience. It reminds us that Pride began with bricks, not branding. So, as rainbow flags wave each June, remember the power of resistance—and that the first Pride was a riot with a cause.\nIndia's relationship with LGBTQIA+ identities stretches back to ancient times, woven into its cultural and spiritual fabric in ways that differ from modern Western perspectives. Early references to homosexuality and trans identities were often neutral or even accepting—appearing in texts like the 'Nāradasmṛti,' a medical treatise, and the 'Pali Canon,' a collection of moral and legal codes. In contemporary times, especially in urban India, there has been a growing wave of acceptance and visibility, allowing LGBTQIA+ communities to reclaim their place in both history and modern society.",

The tropics span a broad region between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn, including parts of Asia, Africa, Oceania, Central America and South America. Nearly 40% of the global population lives in this band, which also hosts 80% of the world's biodiversity. It's rich in culture, nature and history—but also under pressure from rising temperatures, deforestation and fast-paced urban growth.\nFor a tropical tale with extra flavour, look no further than Pulau Ay, photographed here. Nutmeg was once one of the world's most sought-after commodities—and this tiny island in Indonesia's Banda Islands played a key role in its global trade. It once sparked global rivalries and deadly sea battles, influencing the geopolitical boundaries of the modern world. Today, Pulau Ay is a place where reefs shine, nutmeg continues to thrive and history lingers in moss-covered forts.

This fish is easily distinguished by the spine extending from each cheek—hence the name. Groups of spine-cheeked anemonefish form around a single dominant female, and if she disappears, the top male steps up—literally changing sex to take her place. It thrives in warm, shallow waters and sticks close to its chosen sea anemone. The closest marine companion of a spine-cheeked anemonefish is the bubble-tip anemone, as seen in the image. These anemones don't all look alike—their appearances often vary with age, depth and whether they host anemonefish.

These seabirds, known for their vast and noisy breeding colonies, called gannetries, nest on steep cliffs, remote rocky islands and sea stacks that rise from the ocean.\nFew birds hunt as dramatically as the northern gannet, which dives straight into the sea, as seen in today's image. Spotting prey from heights of over 30 metres, the bird folds its wings and hits the water at speeds of over 90 kmph. Its streamlined body, reinforced skull and built-in shock absorbers, such as spongy bone plates and air sacs beneath the skin, make these high-impact dives both powerful and safe. Once underwater, the gannet uses its wings and webbed feet to swim after fish, diving as deep as 21 metres and staying submerged for up to 30 seconds.

		"description": "Italy's Dolomites don't just tower; they enchant, turning every trail into a story. Fondly known as the 'Pale Mountains,' the Dolomites derive their name from dolomite—a carbonate mineral. Set in the northern Italian Alps, the range spans over 1,200 square kilometres and boasts 18 soaring peaks that rise above 2,500 metres. These mountains feature sheer cliffs, lofty walls and a maze of narrow, winding valleys. Amid the dramatic landscape of the Dolomites lies one of its most spectacular peaks, Seceda, featured in today's image. With a height of over 2,000 metres, it offers the highest panoramic viewpoint in Val Gardena, a scenic valley in the province of South Tyrol.\nWhile the Dolomites command awe with their jagged heights and Alpine charm, halfway across the globe, India's Aravalli Range speaks of ancient resilience. One of the oldest mountain ranges in the world, it dates back to the Proterozoic era (2.5 billion to 541 million years). Stretching for about 670 kilometres in a south-west direction, it begins near Delhi, winds through southern Haryana and Rajasthan and ends in Ahmedabad, Gujarat. Its highest peak, Guru Shikhar, rises to 1,722 metres on Mount Abu.",

This pivotal date marks the moment in 1816 when delegates from across the region gathered in the city of San Miguel de Tucumán to declare freedom from Spanish colonial rule. The road to independence was not easy; it followed years of internal struggles and revolutions influenced by global movements, including the American and French revolutions. But the resolve of the Argentine people prevailed.\nSince gaining independence, Argentina has taken important steps in shaping its national identity. The drafting of its first constitution in 1853 established a framework for democratic governance that continues to influence its political system. The country has also made notable contributions to global culture and sports. It has offered the world literary figures like Jorge Luis Borges, a rich culinary tradition centered on asado (a traditional barbecue) and legendary athletes such as Diego Maradona and Lionel Messi. Constitución railway station in Buenos Aires, pictured here, is a historic hub that reflects Argentina's drive for growth, connectivity and the spirit of unity that emerged during a transformative era.",

The event was inspired by Five Billion Day in 1987, which marked the approximate date when the global population hit that milestone. As cities expand, green spaces shrink and agriculture competes for limited land and water resources. But there is a way forward—investing in education, improving access to healthcare and building smarter cities can balance growth with sustainability.\nOn a global scale, India remains the most populous country in 2025 with over 1.46 billion people, followed by China at 1.41 billion. Tokyo, the world's largest city with around 37.2 million people, illustrates the realities of high-density urban life: overcrowded spaces, transport congestion and rising demand for services.

This stretch of savannah in southwestern Kenya teems with wildlife—from elephants stomping through bushes to cheetahs scanning the horizon. Yet sometimes it's the smaller creatures that grab attention—like the Thomson's gazelles featured in today's image.\nKnown as 'tommies,' Thomson's gazelles are among the fastest animals in Africa, reaching speeds of over 80 kilometres per hour. They thrive in the Mara's short grass plains, which provide a clear view of approaching predators. Though adults may seem to be grazing peacefully, their ears are always tuned to nearby movements. Mating occurs year-round, peaking just before the rainy season. Males hold territories, waiting for females to pass through. After a five- to six-month gestation period, the female gives birth to one fawn, weighing around 1 to 3 kilograms. For the first few weeks, the small gazelle stays hidden most of the day. The mother returns briefly to nurse, minimising attention from predators. These early days are crucial as the young learn to run and blend in.\nDespite their delicate appearance, tommies are tough. Many join the great migration during the dry season, relying on their agility and the awareness of wildebeests and zebras to evade danger in search of greener plains.",

If you're wondering where to see geology in action, Iceland is a great place to explore. Today's image takes us to Kálfshamarsvík—a secluded cove on the country's remote Skagi peninsula. Unlike Iceland's famous black sand beaches, this cove's shore is strewn with large, smooth pebbles, while its fiery volcanic past still reveals itself in the towering cliffs.

From late June to mid-July, this high plateau transforms into a purple sea of lavender. Situated more than 500 metres above sea level and spanning approximately 800 square kilometres, it is one of the largest areas in France dedicated to lavender cultivation. Lavender has flourished in Provence for centuries. The ancient Romans brought the plant to southern France, using it for bathing, cooking and healing. Today, 1,700 growers tend to do more than 200 square kilometres of these shrubs. They cultivate both traditional lavender—for perfumes and skincare—and lavandin, the longer-stemmed cousin often found in household cleaning products and air fresheners. So don't just leave it to chance—plan ahead, follow the scent trail, and let your summer bloom with lavender memories.\nKashmir, rich in medicinal plants, is becoming a key player in India's herbal economy, with lavender as a standout. With a steady demand and better-organised farming practices, lavender cultivation is proving to be a profitable venture for local farmers. Recognising this, the Government of India has been implementing transformative initiatives to enhance lavender production and boost exports, aiming to place Kashmir's purple bloom on the global map.",

		"description": "Being surrounded by a shimmering spiral of silver—that's what it feels like to encounter a school of blackfin barracuda at Shark Reef in Ras Mohammed National Park, Egypt. These streamlined fish, marked by sharp V-shaped stripes, move in near-perfect unison. Their slow, deliberate spirals aren't random—they're an evolutionary strategy that offers both safety in numbers and an edge in hunting. Blackfin barracudas are found throughout tropical waters, from the Red Sea to the central Pacific. During the day, they gather in tight, coordinated groups near the reef, scattering at dusk to pursue prey.\nRas Mohammed, at the southern tip of Egypt's Sinai Peninsula, is known for much more than striking fish formations. As the country's first marine protected area, it shelters over 1,000 fish species and more than 200 types of coral. The park is considered a living archive of ecological complexity, where even a fleeting school of barracuda reveals a deeper story of life beneath the surface.",

These ecosystems are among the largest intact temperate grasslands on Earth, stretching thousands of square kilometres of open steppe. They support around 200,000 nomadic herder families and provide habitat for rare species like the Mongolian gazelle and snow leopard. While the day isn't tied to a single founding organisation, it aligns with the mission of global conservation leaders like the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which has worked to protect biodiversity since 1948.\nThis global focus on conservation echoes in India's own long-standing commitment to nature. The country's efforts can be traced all the way back to Emperor Ashoka, whose pillar edicts stand among the earliest known records of environmental stewardship. Today, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change carries that legacy forward—leading initiatives that range from managing national parks and preserving native biodiversity to controlling pollution and promoting sustainable development.",

Every year, International Tiger Day draws attention to these powerful yet endangered big cats. Bengal tigers are more than their unmistakable orange coats and black stripes. They are apex predators, essential to the health and balance of the ecosystems they inhabit. By keeping prey populations like deer and wild boar in check, tigers help shape vegetation patterns and support the overall biodiversity of their environments.\nOne of the best places to see this delicate natural balance in action is Kanha National Park. Among India's oldest protected areas, it was first declared a reserve forest in 1879 and later a national park in 1955. It then became one of the first nine tiger reserves under Project Tiger in 1973, a landmark initiative launched to halt the steep decline in the species. Yet, despite decades of progress, tigers still face threats from habitat fragmentation, poaching and conflict with humans. That's why landscapes like Kanha remain critical—not just for tigers, but for the future of forests and wildlife conservation across the planet.",

Thanks to freshwater streams and fertile soil, early Hawaiians farmed taro (a root vegetable widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions) in stone terraces. Fishing, farming and a deep spiritual connection to the land (āina) shaped daily life. Remnants of temples and house sites still lie hidden in the valley's folds. By the 1920s, most residents had left due to disease, Western contact and shifting land use. In recent decades, off-the-grid seekers sought refuge here until state protections were implemented.

Comedy is the unofficial king of the festival, but there's also drama, dance, drag, musicals, magic, mime, spoken word, circus and acts that defy all categories. The 77th edition of the Edinburgh Festival Fringe featured performances by some of India's top comedians, including Vir Das, Sumukhi Suresh, Urooj Ashfaq, Kanan Gill, Anirban Dasgupta and Rahul Subramanian.

Their connection to the land was both spiritual and practical—and they left behind some of the park's most captivating features, including petroglyphs like those found in Fruita, featured in today's image. These rock panels showcase an ancient visual language, featuring human figures adorned with headdresses and jewelry. Alongside them are animals like bighorn sheep and lizards, as well as abstract shapes alluding to ceremonies, migrations and celestial events.\nInterestingly, echoes of this ancient artistic expression can also be found halfway across the world—in the Bhimbetka rock shelters of Madhya Pradesh. These caves are home to an extraordinary collection of prehistoric art, with paintings dating as far back as 10,000 BCE, and in some cases, possibly 40,000 years.

While sunflowers come in shades of red, orange and maroon, it's the classic yellow blooms with brown centres that are the most common. Beyond their good looks, sunflowers are grown for their tasty seeds, which are snacked on, pressed for cooking oil or offered as a treat for birds.\nIn India, sunflower is sown during the kharif season from late June to mid-July in light soils and up to late August in heavy soils.

		"description": "Not every science lesson requires a classroom. In La Jolla, California, United States, tide pools teach you about ocean life—right at your feet. Along the rocky shoreline of this San Diego coastal neighbourhood, tide pools form during low tide as seawater gets trapped in natural depressions. These shallow pools form naturally along La Jolla's rocky shorelines, especially near Windansea Beach, Shell Beach, South Casa Beach and Hospital Point. The water that remains trapped in sandstone and reef depressions creates habitats for everything from sea hares to brittle stars.\nOver time, the tide pools are created through the process of erosion—waves hit the sandstone and limestone coastlines until they carve out pockets that hold water. Twice a day, as the tide moves in and out, these spaces flood and drain, challenging the survival skills of everything inside. Winter months, when tides are lowest during daylight hours, are ideal for observing them. And remember, these pools are protected under California's Marine Life Protection Act. Enjoy the view, observe those residing in the depressions, take pictures, but don't disturb anything. It is marine biology in motion, and it's free.",

		"description": "It looks like this small creature is playing a game, right? But when a baby ring-tailed lemur wraps its tail around or gives it a tug, it's actually working on crucial skills. The infants spend their early weeks hanging tight to their mom, first clinging to her belly and later to her back. As they grow, they separate from their mom and tail-chasing becomes part of how they learn balance, coordination and group play. These primates use their long tails for communication as well. Raised like flags during group movement, the tails help them stick together in open terrain. Loud, rhythmic calls, scent markings and 'stink fights' between males add to the social drama. Ring-tailed lemurs are found only in southern and southwestern Madagascar, where they live in dry forests, spiny thickets and rocky outcrops.\nIt might be hard to imagine, but the distant relatives of lemurs may have once roamed the Kashmir region of India. Despite Madagascar being over 5,000 kilometres away, fossil hunters have uncovered compelling evidence to support this surprising link. After six years of dedicated research, a partial jawbone—just over two centimetres and a quarter long—was discovered in the Ramnagar region of Jammu and Kashmir.

When Krishna once injured his finger, Draupadi—moved by affection—tore a strip from her saree and gently tied it around his wound. In return, Krishna vowed to protect her whenever she needed help.

		"description": "As the Red Fort echoes with patriotic speeches, the nation celebrates its Independence Day today. Observed every year on August 15, the day marks India's freedom from British rule in 1947. Years of colonial control had fuelled Indian nationalism and deepened the collective desire for self-governance. It was on this day that the Indian Independence Act of 1947 came into force, transferring legislative powers to the Indian Constituent Assembly.\nThis historic milestone was the result of a long and determined freedom movement. The struggle was led by countless leaders, including Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and many others, who inspired the nation through non-violent resistance, civil disobedience, and relentless sacrifice. India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, marked the moment of independence by hoisting the national flag above the Lahori Gate of the Red Fort in Delhi, seen in today's image. Since then, the tradition continues as the serving prime minister unfurls the tricolour at the same iconic spot and addresses the nation each Independence Day.",

		"description": "If you think bees are just out for a sting, think again. These tiny winged workers are running the world's sweetest gig. About 35% of global food crop production relies on animal pollination—and honey bees are among the most important contributors. The value of crops pollinated by bees is estimated at hundreds of billions of dollars each year. But despite their superpowers, bees are in a sticky situation. Today's image shows a row of colourful beehives in Italy. Bees use colour to distinguish between hives, much like humans use house numbers. Blue, yellow, green and red hives help reduce confusion and prevent accidental hive invasions.\nBeekeeping has a long history in India, with references in ancient Vedic texts, Buddhist scriptures and Mesolithic rock paintings in Madhya Pradesh. While scientific beekeeping began in the late 19th century, historical records suggest that honeybees were tamed—and even used in warfare—much earlier. After independence, India promoted beekeeping through rural development programmes. Today, five key bee species support the country's honey and beeswax production, continuing a tradition thousands of years old.",

Standing over 30 metres tall, Lyngvig Lighthouse in Denmark was built in 1906 atop a more- than- 15-metre dune along the west coast of Jutland—the country's westernmost region. Made with a concrete foundation and brick walls, and finished with teak-framed windows and doors, the lighthouse originally required a team of three keepers. They maintained its light until 1965. It has been operating automatically ever since. Following a temporary closure in 2024 due to structural concerns, the lighthouse is now open to the public again.\nThousands of kilometres way, the Mahabalipuram Lighthouse, located in Tamil Nadu, has been guiding ships along the coast for over a century. The first modern light was set up in 1887 on the roof of the ancient Olakkannesvara Temple. The current circular masonry tower, built from natural stone, became fully operational in 1904.",

Tucked away in the Adirondack High Peaks in New York, United States, this less-than-a-square-kilometres alpine lake sits at over 800 metres between Mount Colden and Avalanche Mountain. Shaped by ancient glaciers, the lake is framed by dramatic cliffs and rugged terrain that echo its icy origins. Its most striking feature is the Trap Dike—an over 300-metre rock canyon flanked by steep walls, making the lake one of the most awe-inspiring sights in the Adirondacks. Massive avalanches carved these cliffs, leaving behind the dramatic landscape that gave Avalanche Lake its name.\nThe Avalanche Lake trail begins at the Adirondack Loj, a well-known launch point for adventures in the High Peaks.

It doesn't crawl along the seabed like its stingray cousins—it flies underwater. The species gets its name from—you guessed it—its protruding snout, which resembles an eagle's beak and its distinctive spotted back, which is unique to each individual, much like fingerprints. Their wing-like pectoral fins can span over 3 metres. Near the base of the long tail are venomous spines, in case a predator gets too close. These rays aren't aggressive, but they're not defenceless either.\nThese creatures are often seen alone, but when they travel in groups, it's a show worth watching. Dozens can glide together in perfect sync, like the ones photographed near San Cristóbal Island in Ecuador. They are also known to leap out of the water, sometimes completely clearing the surface, proving you don't need feathers to fly. Despite their elegance, spotted eagle rays are currently listed as near threatened. Their populations are declining due to various threats, including bycatch and habitat degradation.",

Globally, there are around 20 species of wheatears, but in North America, the northern wheatear is the one you're most likely to encounter.\nIt weighs less than a kilogram, but travels thousands of kilometres between its summer homes in Alaska and northern Canada to its wintering grounds in Africa. Its migration route is one of the longest for a bird its size, crossing oceans and continents. Unlike many backyard songbirds, wheatears prefer wide-open spaces with low vegetation, where they can sprint and pounce on insects. And while most North American birders might only catch them in the far north, wheatears are widespread across Europe, Asia and Africa.",

The wheat-covered slopes shift in colour with every passing season. In spring, the hills turn lush shades of green as young wheat and barley begin to grow, while summer transforms them into dry, golden browns as the crops near harvest.\nOften hailed as one of Washington State's most serene natural wonders, the Palouse owes its signature rolling hills to an ancient and fascinating geological story. These dune-like hills were shaped over thousands of years—not by rivers or tectonic shifts, but by windblown dust and fine silt, known as 'loess,' carried from the arid Southwest. During the Ice Ages, glaciers from Canada ground rock into fine 'glacial flour,' which flowed into the prehistoric Glacial Lake Missoula. When ice dams broke, floods swept across eastern Washington, leaving behind layers of silt. Prevailing winds later carried that dust to this region, settling it into the hills we see today.",

The miners themselves played a key role in building the cathedral that still bears her name. Originally envisioned on a much grander scale—twice its current size—the cathedral's fate was tied to the fortunes of the silver mines. In the years that followed, the Jesuits took over, gradually introducing Baroque elements into the original Gothic design.\nAcross continents and centuries, another marvel rises—this time from the sun-soaked shores of Kerala. Nestled in the heart of Fort Kochi, the Santa Cruz Cathedral Basilica—locally known as Kotta Palli or Kottepalli—is a striking blend of history, faith and architectural grandeur.

The Romans likely brought them over, and the Normans later made them common in hunting parks. Now, they're regulars in landscapes from Sussex to Scotland.\nIn summer, these animals sport a reddish-brown coat with white spots. Come winter, they trade it for a darker, greyer version. Bucks (males) grow broad, shovel-shaped antlers, unlike the pointy racks of red or roe deer. In autumn, the bucks clash antlers in the rutting season, competing for the attention of does (females). Fallow deer graze mainly on grasses and leaves, but they won't turn their noses up at herbs, shrubs or the occasional snack from a fruit tree. Despite their poise, they're quick to bolt if spooked.

Over the next ten days, communities come alive with prayer, music and cultural performances. The festival culminates in a vibrant procession on Ananta Chaturdashi, as the murtis are immersed in rivers or seas in a ritual known as visarjana, symbolising a respectful farewell.\nIn recent years, growing environmental awareness has influenced how the festival is observed. Many people now opt for eco-friendly idols made from a mixture of cow dung and clay, like the one featured here. Instead of immersing the murtis in natural water bodies, some families allow them to disintegrate in a barrel of water at home, later using the dissolved clay to nourish their gardens.

The killing might have continued if not for two Boston socialites, Harriet Hemenway and Minna Hall, who led a boycott of the feather trade. Their activism helped launch the National Audubon Society.\nToday, far from the fashion houses of the West, egrets thrive in the wetlands of the Indian subcontinent.

Whale sharks are the biggest fish in the sea, but don't let the word 'shark' fool you. They're plankton-eating giants with no interest in humans. Found in warm waters from the Maldives and Mozambique to Mexico's Yucatán coast, they often show up in food-rich, calm waters. Their mouths can stretch over a metre wide, but they feed by suction, not biting.\nIndia, too, is home to this magnificent species, particularly along its western coast, where Gujarat sees the highest numbers. Yet, despite their presence, scientific understanding of whale sharks in Indian waters remains limited.

The camel thorn trees that once grew here didn't collapse or vanish. The extreme aridity and high salt content in the soil stopped the natural process in its tracks. Under those conditions, even decay gave up. The trees were embalmed by the desert—sun-dried, rigid and rooted in place for up to 900 years.

These are whitewashed stone houses topped with dry-stacked limestone roofs shaped like upside-down ice cream cones. It's an ancient building technique, and in this case, a clever one. Alberobello's trulli aren't hidden one-offs. Entire districts—like Rione Monti and Aia Piccola—are packed with these quirky structures. Some are still lived in, while others have been transformed into cafés, souvenir shops and pint-sized museums. You'll even find a church built in trullo style.\nMeanwhile, in the quake-prone deserts of western India, another form of vernacular brilliance emerged: the bhunga. Developed after the 1819 earthquake in Kutch, these circular mud homes were designed to withstand seismic shocks. Built from locally sourced materials like mud, bamboo and timber, bhungas are as practical as they are beautiful—naturally regulating temperature and resisting both earthquakes and desert storms. Found mainly in Banni and Paccham, they stand as a testament to traditional knowledge and are often hailed as 'architecture without architects.'",

		"description": "Millions of incredible animals roam, fly, swim and slither across our planet. Among the most iconic of these is the grizzly bear, a symbol of the American wilderness. Young grizzlies often 'play-fight' to build strength, sharpen skills and establish social bonds. These heavyweight champs can weigh up to 410 kilograms and still sprint faster than most humans. Once widespread across the western United States, grizzlies now primarily roam Alaska and parts of the Northern Rockies.\nMale grizzly bears typically live around 22 years, while females tend to live longer—up to 26 years—largely because they avoid the risky breeding-season fights that males engage in. Generally solitary and active, grizzlies keep to themselves except for mothers with cubs. However, in coastal regions, they often congregate around rivers, lakes and streams during salmon spawning season.",

It is Chingam, the first month of the Malayalam calendar, a season that ushers in Onam each year, corresponding to August–September in the Gregorian calendar. This festival unfolds over four to ten days, with Atham marking the start and Thiruonam the last day. The festivities include boat races, cultural performances, sports, dances, martial arts, vibrant pookkalam (floral rangoli), prayers, shopping, acts of charity and lavish feasts shared with loved ones.\nAnd while each tradition has its charm, the call of the river is perhaps the most stirring, especially in Aranmula. Amid Onam's vibrancy, the Aranmula Boat Festival, featured here, unfolds on the serene Pampa River near the Parthasarathy Temple in Pathanamthitta. Since 1972, spirited snake boat races have added a competitive edge to the festivities, drawing thousands of spectators. Each pair of boats is a vision of pageantry, adorned with gleaming golden lace, fluttering flags and an ornamental umbrella at the centre.",

With over 4 kilometres of sand, a historic pier and the Pacific Coast Highway keeping things scenic, this beach is more than just a pretty shoreline. Let's start with the sand. Wide, clean and ready for volleyball or just flopping down with a good book, it's ideal for sunbathers and sandcastle architects alike. Then there's the Santa Monica Pier. Built in 1909 and still standing tall on wooden legs, it's got an amusement park called Pacific Park, arcade, restaurants and that famous solar-powered Ferris wheel.\nFrom the vibrant energy of Santa Monica, the journey to the other side of the world lands you at another coastal gem, Marina Beach in Chennai. Averaging 300 metres in width and expanding to 437 metres at its broadest point, it's one of the largest urban beaches in India. Here, the sea's beauty comes with a warning—its turbulent undercurrents make swimming off-limits. Still, that doesn't stop it from drawing about 30,000 visitors on a typical weekday, all eager to soak in the coastal breeze and the buzzing atmosphere.",

It is part of Tricity—a metropolitan area along the Gdańsk Bay that includes the neighbouring coastal cities of Sopot and Gdynia, along with nearby towns. The city likely takes its name from 'Gdania,' an earlier name for the Motława river that runs through it.\nThe city originated as a Slavic fort in the late 10th century and was first recorded in 997, when it came under the early influence of the Polish state. Over the centuries, Gdańsk has experienced Polish, German and independent rule, each leaving a mark on the region's identity. The Main City draws most visitors, especially to the lively promenade that runs along Ulica Długa (Long Street) and Długi Targ (Long Market). Flanked by decorative gates and lined with stately townhouses rebuilt in 17th-century style, this pedestrian stretch is steeped in charm. Once the ceremonial path for Polish royalty, it's now fondly known as the Royal Route. The path unfolds like a living museum, dotted with historic landmarks like the Highland Gate, Amber Museum, Uphagen's House, Main Town Hall, Neptune's Fountain and the grand Artus Court.",

India's National Literacy Mission sees literacy as more than just knowing how to read, write and do basic arithmetic—it's about putting those skills to work in everyday life. Functional literacy means understanding the causes of deprivation and working to change them. It involves gaining skills to improve one's economic status and overall well-being. Recognising its far-reaching impact, International Literacy Day—observed each year on September 8 since 1967—serves as a reminder of how vital literacy is in building a better, more sustainable future for all. This year, the theme explores literacy in a digital age, where technology continues to reshape how people learn, communicate and participate in society.\nBringing this vision to life in a youth-centric urban setting, library@orchard at Orchard Gateway in Singapore, featured here, reflects a bold shift in how libraries engage with younger audiences.

		"description": "Quick, clever and always on the move—meet the Eurasian red squirrel, a leafy treetop resident found across much of Europe and Asia. While it prefers the shelter of forests, this agile creature easily adapts to gardens and parks. It builds its nest, called a drey, high in the fork of a tree using twigs to form a domed structure about 25 to 30 centimetres wide. The female featured here is gathering moss—one of several soft materials, along with bark, leaves and grass, that line the nest and turn it into a snug, well-insulated retreat. These rodents may also take over tree hollows or abandoned woodpecker holes when available.\nTypically solitary and quite shy, they rarely share food or space. However, during colder months, it's not uncommon for several individuals to use the same nest to stay warm. Their social organisation is shaped by dominance hierarchies, both within and between the sexes. While males aren't always dominant over females, the top-ranking individuals tend to be older and larger. Dominant males also tend to occupy larger home ranges than subordinate males or most females.",

		"description": "'Make hay while the sun shines' may sound like an old proverb, but in farming it's a practical truth. Hay baling plays a crucial role in agriculture worldwide. It involves cutting, drying and packaging grasses to feed livestock during the colder months. The process depends heavily on the weather: the grass must be dry before it's baled, or it risks moulding. Farmers must act quickly once a dry spell arrives, making it a seasonal race.\nThe practice of baling dates back centuries, evolving from horse-powered balers of the 1800s to today's high-powered machines that can wrap and eject bales in minutes. In North Yorkshire, England—where today's image was taken—the rolling lowlands and upland meadows create ideal conditions for growing and curing high-quality hay. With grazing livestock such as sheep and cattle making up around 40% of farm holdings, hay is a key feed resource supporting the region's rural economy. So, when you see golden fields dotted with neat, sunlit rolls, you're witnessing the result of careful timing and hard work. It's a tradition that remains as important today as ever.",

It is also said that, now and then, butterflies can be spotted fluttering among the surrounding plants and trees. Dolphins are also known to make playful appearances just off the shore. Unlike busier beaches like Anjuna and Calangute, this peaceful cove offers a more intimate encounter. The beach is also renowned for its vibrant marine life; at low tide, colourful crabs and starfish appear along the shore. Adding to its charm, the lush green forests that embrace the cove create a stunning natural backdrop, making every visit a picture-perfect experience.",

First observed in 2022, World Dolphin Day shines a light on these intelligent marine mammals and the oceans they rely on. Over 40 dolphin species swim our seas, from the Māui dolphin to the Irrawaddy dolphin. They're expert navigators, problem-solvers and team players. Some even form superpods—temporary gatherings of hundreds or thousands of dolphins moving together offshore.\nOff the coast of Marsa Alam in Egypt, pods of spinner dolphins glide through the warm waters of the Red Sea—as seen in today's image. True to their name, they can leap and spin in the air up to seven times in a single jump. Found in tropical waters across the Pacific, Indian and Atlantic Oceans, they rest during the day in calm bays and hunt offshore at night.\nIndia is home to several freshwater species like the endangered Gangetic river dolphin. Threats such as polluted waters, shrinking habitats and accidental entanglement in fishing nets put their survival at risk. To turn the tide, India has rolled out dedicated conservation measures, most notably the 'Project Dolphin' initiative, aimed at safeguarding their natural homes and securing their future.",

They hunt with patient precision, gently picking insects, larvae and tiny crustaceans from the water's surface. Every movement reflects a subtle mastery of their environment, shaped by patience and instinct.\nBut these birds are more than graceful wanderers. Nesting on bare ground, they remain vulnerable to rising waters and human disturbance, serving as living indicators of ecological health. Their presence signals balance; their absence, a warning. To protect the stilts is to protect the fragile harmony of wetlands—those shimmering worlds where life breathes in silence.

The Montreal Protocol, signed in 1987, led to a swift phase-out of ozone-depleting substances. Today, satellites show that the hole over Antarctica is shrinking. Scientists believe it could be fully healed by mid-century.\nOn September 16, we mark the International Day for the Preservation of the Ozone Layer—a celebration of science, global cooperation and collective will.
