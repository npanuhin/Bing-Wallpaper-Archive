		"description": "Today's image features white rhinoceros in Lake Nakuru, Kenya. Their journey illustrates the importance of conservation efforts. They have two subspecies: the near-threatened southern white rhinoceros and the critically endangered northern white rhinoceros. In the late 19th century, the southern white rhino, found in South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe and Kenya, was on the brink of extinction due to relentless poaching for their horns. But thanks to more than a century of dedicated management, their numbers have bounced back significantly. Unfortunately, the northern white rhino is in a precarious situation, with only two left—a mother and daughter. They're now under protection at Kenya's Ol Pejeta Conservancy.\nIndia is also home to its own rhino species, the Indian rhinoceros or greater one-horned rhinoceros. Historically, it roamed across the entire Indo-Gangetic Plain, but overhunting and agricultural expansion have drastically reduced its range, now limited to 11 sites in northern India and southern Nepal. Classified as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, its population is fragmented and confined to less than 20,000 square kilometres.",

		"description": "Windswept cliffs, rugged beauty and dramatic ocean views—welcome to Land's End in Cornwall, England. Since ancient Greek times, when it was known as 'Belerion' or 'Place of the Sun' or in Arthurian legends about the lost land of Lyonesse, Land's End has always been a place of fascination. Land's End is the most south-westerly point on mainland Britain. It is most famous for being the starting point or end of charity races which run the length of the island of Great Britain from Land's End to John O'Groats - at Britain's north-easterly tip.\nThe first thing you'll notice about Land's End is the cliffs towering above the crashing waves. The sea carved these granite walls over millennia, creating one of the most striking coastlines in the United Kingdom. These cliffs are part of the South West Coast Path, an over 1000-kilometre trail popular among hikers that runs from Minehead in Somerset to Poole in Dorset. The Cornish Coastal Path, featured in today's image, is a section of this trail, and snow here is a rare occurrence because of Cornwall's mild coastal climate and proximity to the Atlantic Ocean. So, whether you're here to hike, relax or just stand at the frozen edge, Land's End is a memorable cliffhanger.",

These sandstone balls—a phenomenon known as concretions—formed over millions of years as sedimentary layers built up around a central core of sand and stone held together by mineral cements. Erosion gradually wore away the outer layers to expose the spherical shapes we see today. This created a fascinating spectacle that only appears at low tide. Concretions are rare, and there has been plenty of wild speculation about where they come from, with some believing them to be extraterrestrial debris while others wondering if they are dinosaur fossils.

Now, it has grown into an annual event with more than a billion people in over 193 countries taking part.\nThis year, the campaign's focus is on plastics, which are a particularly serious form of pollution on land and in the oceans. Many species—including this green sea turtle—eat the plastic waste they find in the ocean, mistaking it for food. These same plastics pose an entanglement risk and can also break down to become microplastics. Every year some 25 million tonnes of plastic enter aquatic ecosystems. So, whether you're planting trees, cleaning up beaches or simply spreading the word, let's remember to promote sustainable living. After all, there's no planet B!",

It marks the shared death anniversary of William Shakespeare, Miguel de Cervantes and several other literary greats.\nIn India, the day aims to promote and raise awareness about reading and book publishing across the nation. Interestingly, each year, UNESCO crowns one city as the 'World Book Capital.' The chosen city then carries out activities aimed at promoting reading for the awarded year; this year it is Strasbourg, France. So, have you picked out a book to read yet?",

Despite their small size, Adélie penguins are sleek swimmers and can dive as deep as 175 metres in search of shrimp-like krill or fish. They are social animals which gather in small colonies for foraging, hunting and protection. While it may seem mischievous, Adélies steal pebbles from nearby nests to strengthen their own, safeguarding their eggs and chicks from Antarctica's harsh conditions and predators.",

These shrubs, known for their intricate network of stilt roots, play a crucial ecological role. Acting as 'green shields,' they provide essential protection against coastal erosion and help mitigate the potentially catastrophic effects of natural calamities. Having evolved unique mechanisms to absorb additional oxygen and expel salt, they endure conditions that are fatal to most flora. Their intricate salt filtration and robust roots enable them to withstand saltwater submersion and wave impact, while thriving in the low-oxygen mud of the intertidal zone's upper regions. Analysis of satellite imagery in 2014 has unveiled this hidden ecological treasure along Karnataka's coast. Despite mangroves being traditionally associated with India's east coast, Karnataka boasts a significant expanse of these vibrant saline-water ecosystems.",

These hummingbirds are typically vibrant in colour, but leucism means that they have decreased pigmentation, resulting in a paler appearance. Unlike albino birds, these hummingbirds retain some colour in their eyes. They are equipped with specialised adaptations like a long tongue for feeding on nectar from flowers. However, their diet is not limited to nectar alone; they also supplement their nutrition by consuming small insects and other arthropods. Their lighter plumage reduces protective camouflage, making them more vulnerable to predators such as hawks and feral cats.",

Hidden beneath its desert scenery are more than 119 caves—formed when sulphuric acid dissolved the surrounding limestone. This national park, founded on this day in 1930, is also home to North America's largest underground chamber—the Big Room. From colossal stalactite formations hanging like chandeliers to stalagmite structures reaching for the ceiling, every nook and cranny is a masterpiece crafted over millions of years. This UNESCO World Heritage Site also organises events like bat flight viewings, which allow visitors to watch thousands of bats as they swoop in and out of the cavern. So, are you ready to explore the depths?",

Vernazza got its name from the indigenous wine, 'vernaccia,' meaning 'local' or 'ours.' One of the best-known monuments in the area is Doria Castle, built in the 15th century as a defensive fortress to protect the village from frequent pirate attacks. Thanks to the construction of the Genoa–La Spezia rail line in the 19th century, the village became more accessible by land. The cobblestone streets and absence of cars make it ideal for walking around. While here, you might want to visit the Chapel of Santa Marta and the Sanctuary of Madonna di Reggio. Did you know that this region inspired the 2021 animated film 'Luca'?

Bees come in a range of sizes, from just 0.20 centimetres all the way up to 3.9 centimetres, and there are over 20,000 known species. They are one of the most important pollinators in the world. They help keep trees, flowers and crops alive, which helps secure food chains as well as boosting biodiversity by keeping a wide range of plants alive. It's no overstatement to say that bees are vital for humans' survival.\nHoney bees, like the one in today's image, construct nests from wax and produce a surplus amount of honey. This excess means that humans can harvest honey without endangering the bees themselves.

The birds in today's image are in Bardia National Park in Nepal, but they're found across many other South Asian countries, from India and Bangladesh to Sri Lanka and Thailand. They catch their prey mid-flight, returning to a perch where they can beat stinging insects to stun them, which makes them safe to eat. These birds are designed to hunt: their dazzling green plumage helps camouflage them in dappled jungle light, their curved beak is perfect for picking off insects with precision and their eyes can move individually, which makes them all the better for spotting bees.",

This year's theme focuses on land restoration, desertification and drought resilience.\nPictured here is Madagascar's Masoala National Park, part of the Rainforests of the Atsinanana UNESCO World Heritage Site. This park, which covers over 2,408 square kilometres, is a wildlife haven, harbouring 10 lemur species like red ruffed lemur and aye-aye, birds like red owl and helmet vanga, as well as other species such as Madagascar day geckos and tomato frogs. In times past, illegal rosewood loggers threatened this region, but the strength of unity and conservation has made a stand. So, let's take inspiration from Masoala and champion the planet that cradles us all. After all, there is no planet B.",

This day is about honouring and protecting the world's oceans and serves as a reminder of the critical role oceans play in supporting life on Earth. These gargantuan water bodies, after all, teem with wonders, from the tiniest plankton to the grandest whales like the humpbacks we see here. The oceans also produce almost half of the oxygen on our planet thanks to the photosynthesis of plankton—tiny plants, algae and bacteria. Moreover, they absorb a significant amount of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, helping mitigate the impacts of climate change caused by human activities.\nOceans face many threats, including rising sea temperatures thanks to global warming, plastic pollution and ocean acidification, which threatens many marine species. The theme for this year's World Oceans Day is 'Awaken New Depths.' This motto encourages us to delve deeper into the ocean's complexities and take urgent actions to ensure that these fascinating, ocean-dwelling animals continue to grace our planet for generations to come.

But the city's charm isn't just in its gastronomic delights. Step into the past's embrace at Osaka Castle, a majestic relic of Japan's rich history and a symbol of unwavering resilience.

The Registan Square is encircled by three Islamic schools, namely the Ulugh Beg Madrasah, the Sher-Dor Madrasah and the Tilya-Kori Madrasah, characterised by the Islamic architectural style, which typically features elaborate repetitive patterns and ornamental forms. The influence of Registan's magnificence is seen everywhere, from the Safavid monuments of Persia to the Mughal buildings of India and Pakistan.

Surfing involves riding a wave using a board, regardless of the stance. Ancient surfers often rode waves on their belly and knees. Today, surfing typically means riding a wave standing on a surfboard, known as stand-up surfing.\nWith more than 7,500 kilometres of coastline, encompassing its island groups, India presents a plethora of prime surfing locations. The peak of wave activity is typically between May and September, coinciding with the pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons.

		"description": "Amid the arid expanse of the Mojave Desert in Nevada, US, lies the natural grandeur of the Valley of Fire State Park. This park, which stretches across 186 square kilometres, is named after the fiery red Aztec Sandstone, an Early Jurassic geological formation made up of ancient sand dunes. The park's highlight, Fire Wave, is a geological marvel that appears like a frozen wave with its red, pink and white stripes.\nIn the park, you will come across mysterious petroglyphs, rock carvings made by scratching on the rock's surface, left by the Ancestral Puebloans, who were farmers from the nearby Moapa Valley. It is likely they practiced hunting and performed religious ceremonies in this area. If you are a history buff, you might want to try and decode the cryptic messages carved on the rock faces. Well, put on your hiking shoes and get ready to wander, to wonder and to witness the Valley of Fire State Park.",

		"description": "Dive deep beneath the waves surrounding the Banggai Islands in Indonesia and meet the Banggai cardinalfish. Cardinalfish can grow over 7 centimetres and have tiny shimmery bodies with black vertical stripes and white-edged fins, which help them disguise. Unlike some finned creatures that migrate long distances, these pint-sized fish inhabit a small world, rarely straying far from their local reefs.\nEach young cardinalfish begins life being guarded by their fathers, who carry the eggs in their mouths for up to 30 days to shield them from the aquatic perils. Within these jaws, young fish embark on a silent metamorphosis, soon to emerge, ready to explore the currents. In their early stages, they form dense schools for protection against predators and hide among the spines of sea urchins and anemones. The diet of these opportunistic feeders primarily consists of small fish, crustaceans and plankton. Their existence whispers tales of resilience—a creature to cherish and protect for the spectacle of life it presents.",

		"description": "Welcome to Florence, the cradle of the Renaissance! Let the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore transport you through time. More than just a church, this Gothic structure, with its red-tiled dome, is steeped in centuries of history. Built over an older cathedral dedicated to Santa Reparata, construction began in 1296 under the supervision of architect Arnolfo di Cambio.\nFilippo Brunelleschi, an Italian architect and designer, engineered its dome, which is the largest brick dome ever constructed. It was built without the support of traditional wooden frameworks; its completion in 1436 was the final stage of the cathedral's construction. It's not just the outside that dazzles; inside there are artistic treasures to discover, from Giorgio Vasari's fresco 'The Last Judgement' to Paolo Uccello's intricate clock face. The cathedral complex is also home to the Baptistery, a small basilica, and Giotto's Campanile, a free-standing bell tower. Step inside, and you're walking on history—every visit gives a glimpse of the past and a demonstration of human potential.",

At the time, homosexuality was illegal, and raids against LGBTQIA+ establishments were common. However, on that night, the patrons of the Stonewall Inn, fed up with the continued harassment, decided to stand their ground. Violence escalated, leading to clashes between protesters and police. In the following days, there was more rioting as people gathered to protest the raids.\nOn June 28 the following year, gay pride marches were held in New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago to mark the anniversary of the riots. Similar marches soon started to be held annually in hundreds of places across the US and the rest of the world. June 28 is now celebrated as International LGBTQIA+ Pride Day. In 2016, the Stonewall Inn, Christopher Park and several nearby streets were officially dedicated as the Stonewall National Monument. So, today is the perfect time to remember those who have fought for LGBTQIA+ rights before, during and after Stonewall.",

Meerkats are highly social animals, living in tight-knit groups called mobs, which can consist of up to 30 individuals.\nThese groups are a cooperative effort, with meerkats foraging together, grooming each other, babysitting and taking turns as sentinels to watch for predators. These critters create extensive burrows where they spend the night and retreat to escape the midday heat–meerkats love their afternoon siesta. Classed as 'least concern' on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species, these tiny mammals are vital for controlling insect populations in their desert habitats.

Another Marine Day tradition is to give something back to the ocean by throwing mudballs into the water; these balls are packed with microorganisms that help to purify the sea. Today's image takes us to Tateishi Park in Yokosuka. This scenic spot has stunning views of Sagami Bay and Mount Fuji, making it the perfect place to celebrate Japan's coastal waters on Marine Day.",

		"description": "Imagine swaying gently under a canopy of leaves, a soft breeze coaxing you into a serene slumber while you gaze at the stars above. Invented by the Indigenous peoples of Central and South America, hammocks were called 'Hamacas' and were originally woven for sleep and relaxation. Back then hammocks were made from the bark of trees, whereas now they can be made of various materials like cotton, nylon and canvas. They come in different shapes and sizes, like Nicaraguan hammocks, which are usually made of woven material with a wooden spreader bar. These sleeping swings have sailed across oceans as sailor beds, swung from the trees as forest dwellers' bedrooms and nowadays, add a touch of chill to hip outdoor retreats. They have health benefits, too; gentle rocking can improve your sleep and even relieve stress. So go ahead, jump into a hammock, and let it gently sway your worries away for a while.",

With origins as a self-ruling city, in the Middle Ages, this walled Bavarian town once flourished with 6,000 inhabitants, making it the Holy Roman Empire's second-largest city at the time. The growth of Rothenburg ob der Tauber slowed in the 17th century, preserving its original character.\nPictured here is Burgtor or the castle gate, which was built after the original Rothenburg Castle was destroyed by an earthquake in 1356. Within the castle gate is an 'eye-of-the-needle' door, designed to be the only way in and out of the castle when the main gates closed at night. But Rothenburg's magic isn't confined to its walls. It's also a gateway to the approximately 460-kilometre Romantic Road that runs from Würzburg to Füssen, covering Bavaria's castle-studded valleys. Upon return, things can get festive at the Käthe Wohlfahrt Christmas Village, a dream for holiday enthusiasts. So, 'burg' up for a medieval adventure.",

Running from July 15 to 21, Coral Reef Awareness Week is the perfect time to honour them. Coral reefs are formed by tiny marine organisms called coral polyps, which create vast colonies that serve as homes to a diverse array of marine species. As we turn our attention to their beauty and benefits, it's vital to recognise the lurking threats–climate change, pollution and harmful human activities.\nPictured here is Mayotte, a paradise beneath the Indian Ocean's surface. This French Island boasts one of the world's largest and deepest lagoons, encircled by a coral reef of nearly 160 kilometres long. Mayotte's lagoon is home to over 250 species of coral and over 3,500 marine species. But it is facing numerous threats, including overfishing and coral bleaching, where corals expel the algae that live in their tissues, leading to a loss of colour and essential energy sources. So, this week, let's pledge to preserve coral reefs like this one. Dive in, because every splash counts.",

Jaguars arrived in the Americas some 2 million years ago, migrating from Eurasia through the Bering Strait. Today, they inhabit diverse habitats, from the woodlands of southwestern United States to the rainforests of northern Argentina.\nOften found near bodies of water, jaguars are excellent swimmers, ambushing prey by leaping into the water. True carnivores, jaguars rely exclusively on meat for their nutritional needs. They feed on a wide range of animals, including deer, armadillos, monkeys and lizards. Their strong teeth and jaws can also bite through turtle shells and crocodile heads. In the Brazilian Pantanal, a small population of jaguars primarily feeds on aquatic reptiles and fish. So, the next time you are on a jungle trail, keep your eyes peeled and your senses sharp – remember: every rustle of leaves could be a jaguar on the prowl!",

Initially celebrated as National Moon Day in the United States, the day was recognised globally by the United Nations in 2021. Apollo 11, the pioneering space mission that first landed humans on the moon, was launched on July 16, 1969. It culminated in the astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin taking the first steps on the moon on July 20, 1969.\nThe Chandrayaan programme is India's ongoing lunar exploration series led by ISRO. It includes a lunar orbiter, an impactor, a soft lander and a rover. The programme has had three missions, yielding two orbiters and two lander-rover pairs. While Chandrayaan-2's lander and rover crashed, Chandrayaan-3 successfully landed on 23 August 2023, making India the first nation to land at the lunar south pole and the fourth to achieve a soft landing on the moon, following the Soviet Union, the USA and China. Moon missions have found no signs of life, but it could be a future site for human colonisation. The discovery of water ice, especially in the dark craters at the poles, makes it more hospitable for potential settlers. So, until you have a chance to live there, keep dreaming under the same moon that has captivated humanity since time immemorial.",

The Brahmanical caves, including the Kailasa Temple, were carved between the 7th and 10th centuries. From the 9th to the 12th centuries, the final phase, produced the Jain caves. The caves here exemplify the harmonious coexistence of three major religions—Buddhism, Brahmanism and Jainism—showcasing ancient India's spirit of tolerance.

The day commemorates our country's major military success against Pakistan during the war. After the 1971 Indo-Pakistani War, direct armed conflicts were rare until the 1990s when tensions rose due to separatist activities in Kashmir and nuclear tests by both nations in 1998. Despite the Lahore Declaration in 1999, Pakistan initiated the covert Operation Badri, leading to the Kargil War that lasted for almost 3 months.\nIn response to Operation Badri, India launched Operation Vijay, which involved intense combat in high-altitude mountainous terrain, presenting significant challenges for the Indian troops. Nevertheless, their bravery, determination and superior military strategy enabled them to achieve victory on July 26, 1999, a date now celebrated as Kargil Vijay Diwas.

Initially championed by the greeting card industry, Friendship Day saw a resurgence, especially in Bangladesh and Malaysia, along with India, fueled by social networking sites and the widespread use of mobile phones, digital communication and social media.\nFrom exchanging friendship bracelets to sharing social media posts and messages, people have come up with their own special traditions to appreciate their pals. This is a good day to reflect on the many ways friendship impacts our lives, much like the symbiotic relationship between the impala and the red-billed oxpecker, pictured here in South Africa. Both these animals get something out of this relationship: the oxpecker gets food by eating ticks from the impala's skin, while the impala gets to stay clean. This animal duo showcases nature's version of companionship. So, reach out to your friends to express gratitude and simply say, 'I appreciate you.'",

A member of the mint family, lavender originated in the Mediterranean, India and the Middle East. These purple-hued plants have thrived through various civilisations. It was used by the Egyptians for mummification; traces of lavender were discovered in the tomb of Tutankhamun. It was also treasured by the Romans for its healing and cleansing properties.\nLavender is planted during the spring season, reaching its peak bloom in July. It doesn't just look good, it smells great too, and is said to help people relax. The fragrant oil is a staple in wellness practices, including aromatherapy, where it's used for stress relief, and is a valued ingredient in the perfume industry. This plant is also used in the kitchen, adding a floral touch to dishes and drinks. So, next time you feel stressed, let a few drops of the lavender essential oil calm you down.",

The islet is all that remains of a volcano that erupted about 230,000 years ago. According to Hawaiian mythology, Pele the fire goddess was in love with a man named Mo'o. The trouble was that Mo'o was in love with another woman. Pele's revenge was typically violent: she cut her rival in two, her body becoming Molokini, while her head became Pu'u Olai, a cinder cone on Maui.\nThese days, Molokini Crater is a prime scuba and snorkelling destination; the islet's crescent shape protects divers from waves and currents, allowing them to enjoy the reef, where visibility can reach up to 45 metres. This habitat is home to at least 250 species of fish, including black triggerfish and parrotfish, 38 species of hard coral and some 100 species of algae. So, come on in, the water's lovely. Just be sure not to anger Pele.",

		"description": "Think you can win a staring contest with one of these? With piercing yellow eyes against a grey-brown face, spotted owlets are often seen when small birds spot them during the day and mob them. Once located, these primarily nocturnal owls will often stare down intruders, bob their heads and emit a loud 'chirurrr-chirurrr-chirurrr' screech, or what's sometimes described as laughter or chuckling.\nStanding around 20 centimetres tall, speckle-plumed spotted owlets can be found from Iran to Vietnam. This one was photographed in Bangkok, Thailand. They primarily eat insects and small mammals like bats and mice, which they often store to eat later when food is scarce. Spotted owlets are a remarkably resilient species that flourish in environments such as semi-deserts, rocky areas, forests, farmlands and urban areas. While they aren't endangered, the spotted owlet's population is thought to have declined in the last four years, perhaps owing to loss of habitat and increased urbanisation.",

During a jungle expedition, he found the entrance to a cave with a roaring underground river, which was later named Hang Sơn Đoòng, or 'cave of the mountain river.' In 2009, the British Cave Research Association led an expedition to explore the site. It was then that they realised something incredible: it was the world's largest cave.\nHow large, you ask? Hang Sơn Đoòng's main passage is 4.9 kilometres long, 149 metres wide and 201 metres high. That's tall enough to fit a 40-storey skyscraper! Inside, there is a 60-metre calcite barrier called the 'Great Wall of Vietnam' and stalagmites stretching as tall as 79 metres. It even has its own weather system; clouds form inside the cave due to temperature differences between the cave air and the outside air. Moreover, a subterranean river links Hang Sơn Đoòng to the nearby Hang Thung cave, suggesting yet undiscovered depths. Given its fragile ecosystem, strict regulations are in place to preserve Hang Sơn Đoòng's pristine condition. Tours of the cave are limited to 1,000 visitors per year.",

This habitat loss brings them into closer contact with humans, which can lead to serious problems for both elephants and humans.\nToday's image features a herd of African elephants roaming the vast expanses of Amboseli National Park, Kenya. Elephants live in groups that are made up of several families, which are led by an older female elephant called a matriarch. Males leave to live alone or in bachelor herds, joining females during mating. Sadly, all three species of elephants are endangered.

Today, World Lizard Day, is the perfect time to learn about these cold-blooded creatures. With more than 7,000 species, these animals have adapted to a wide range of environments—from deserts to rainforests. Take the gecko, for example. These little climbers have specialised toe pads that let them scale walls and even walk on ceilings. Then there's the chameleon, known for its colour-changing skin. While many think it's all about blending in, chameleons also change colour to communicate and regulate their temperature.\nNow let's focus on the peculiar creature in today's image that's trekking across the arid landscape in Australia's Watarrka National Park. Its pace is deliberate, its skin a maze of spiky armour. Meet the thorny devil, also known as the thorny dragon or Moloch. With clever hydrophilic skin that channels moisture to its mouth, this reptile can hydrate just from the dew on its body. It can thrive in extreme desert conditions that would be inhospitable to many. So, the next time you spot a lizard, take a moment to appreciate these cool, scaly wonders of the animal kingdom.",

The celebration is observed on the last day of the Hindu lunar month of Shravana, usually in August.\nThe term 'Raksha Bandhan' means the bond of protection, obligation or care in Sanskrit. Historically, the term referred to a different ritual where priests would tie amulets or threads on their patrons' wrists and receive gifts in return, a practice still followed in some areas. Over time, the sister-brother version of the festival, with roots in folk traditions, became more popular. The festival had different names in folk culture, depending on the region, like 'saluno,' 'silono' and 'rakri.' While it is typically a North Indian tradition, Raksha Bandhan is also celebrated in Central and Western India, Nepal, and among Hindu communities overseas, like in Fiji, as well as Pakistan and Mauritius.

		"description": "Today, let us step into Golconda Fort in the bustling city of Hyderabad. This fort once housed a vault that safeguarded some of the world's most famous gems, including the legendary Koh-i-Noor and Hope diamonds. The origins of the fort date back to the 11th century when it was first established as a modest mud fort by Pratāparudra of the Kakatiya Empire. It's also believed that the Kakatiya ruler Ganapatideva, who reigned from 1199 to 1262, constructed a stone outpost on the hilltop to protect the empire's western frontier.\nThis outpost would later evolve into the iconic Golconda Fort. In 1518, Sultan Quli of the Qutb Shahi dynasty expanded and transformed the fort into a formidable citadel, eventually designating the surrounding city as the capital of the Golconda Sultanate. In 2014, UNESCO added the Golconda Fort complex to its tentative list of World Heritage Sites in the region under the collective title 'Monuments and Forts of the Deccan Sultanate.' Although the fort is now abandoned, its historical importance still resonates strongly.",

Their dark scales are a masterstroke of camouflage, giving them an edge in hunting a variety of aquatic and terrestrial prey. Their role extends beyond predation, however. They indirectly protect our agricultural interests by maintaining balance within their ecosystem, preventing overpopulation of species such as piranhas and capybaras, which can affect local agriculture and livestock.",

		"description": "On August 30, India unites with the global community to shine a spotlight on whale sharks. Originally discovered off South Africa's coast in the 1820s, these creatures have patrolled the seas for more than 240 million years. The whale shark holds the record as the largest fish on Earth, reaching lengths up to 12 metres, with one exceptional individual measuring a remarkable 18.8 metres. Found in tropical oceans around the world, these filter feeders glide through the water, mouth wide open, straining plankton and small fish. Each pattern on their dotted, starry skin is as unique as a human fingerprint.\nSadly, the International Union for Conservation of Nature lists whale sharks as endangered due to overfishing, habitat loss and climate change. Amid adversity, there is hope, like in Cenderawasih Bay in Indonesia, a whale shark oasis that's pictured here. In this bay, these titans dine on the generosity of fishermen who feed them baitfish for luck, reflecting a unique bond between man and marine life.",

The exact origins of the festival are not clear, but it has been a prominent public celebration in Pune since the time of King Shivaji, who ruled from 1630 to 1680. Later freedom fighter Bal Gangadhar popularised it in Maharashtra in 1893. This move aimed to foster a 'Hindu nationalist identity' and resist British colonial rule.\nGanesh Chaturthi is observed with the installation of clay Ganesha idols both in homes and in grand public displays set up on temporary stages called pandals. The festivities conclude with a grand public procession, featuring music and collective chanting. On Ananta Chaturdashi, or the tenth day, the idol is carried to a nearby river or sea for immersion, known as 'visarjana'.

They feature a striking staircase formation, with a two-step cascade created by three layers of basalt.\nBefore these falls became the spot we know today, they had quite a journey. Spanish explorer Alvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca might have been the first European to see the falls. In 1907, businessman Domingo Ayarragaray saw the potential of this area and built a hotel and roads. The falls became such a sensation that they were designated as national parks in both countries—Argentina's Iguazu National Park in 1934 and Brazil's Iguaçu National Park in 1939.

Experts are divided on the timeline of the Polynesians' arrival, though many researchers suggest that it occurred around the 8th century. Take in the mesmerising sunrise featured in today's image and explore the striking volcanic craters and lush, grassy plains where the imposing statues stand. The World Heritage property of Easter Island spans more than 68 square kilometres, including four nearby islets.\nCurious about the island's name? The original inhabitants call it Rapa Nui, meaning 'Great Rapa,' referring to the land's topographic similarity to Rapa Island, part of the Austral Islands. Dutch explorer Jacob Roggeveen, the first European to visit, named it Paasch-Eyland, or 'Easter Island' in English, to mark his arrival on Easter Sunday. And although Easter may seem a long way from today, you can explore this unique World Heritage site year-round. Dive into its vibrant history and let the island's charm sweep you away.",

Named after Anna Masséna, Duchess of Rivoli, it's one of an estimated 366 hummingbird species, and is the most common species on North America's western coast. With its shimmering emerald feathers and sparkling rose-pink throat, this little bird is a sight to behold. Hummingbirds are known for their incredible speed; they can flap their wings up to 80 times per second, allowing them to hover in place and even fly backward. Emily Dickinson aptly describes their swift movement: 'A Route of Evanescence / With a revolving Wheel—.' Their high metabolism requires them to eat constantly, so they spend their days flitting from flower to flower, sipping nectar and catching insects.",

These marsupials, smaller cousins of the kangaroo, are native to Australia and New Guinea. Wallabies have around 30 different species, including brush wallabies, rock-wallabies, hare-wallabies, nail-tail wallabies and swamp wallabies. These agile and sprightly mammals are herbivores, nibbling on grasses, leaves and fruits. With a height of 30 to 105 centimetres, wallabies have strong hind legs that help them take impressive leaps and serve as a defence against predators. During mating season, male wallabies engage in boxing bouts to show dominance to grab females' attention. Social creatures, wallabies form small groups called 'mobs,' which provide safety and mutual grooming. Their playgrounds are forests that echo with the thudding of their hops as they navigate their home range with ease.",

It's traditionally observed on the 15th day of the eighth month in the Chinese lunar calendar. Dating back more than 3,000 years to China's Shang Dynasty, this festival celebrates moon watching and the end of the harvest season. During the festivities, mooncakes—round delicacies filled with sweet bean paste, salted egg yolks or lotus seeds—are often shared among friends and family. Lanterns of different shapes, sizes and hues, symbolising good fortune, illuminate the night. Asian communities across the world come together to showcase a mélange of cultural performances, heartfelt renditions of the Moon Festival's poetic tales.\nAs depicted in today's image, Gardens by the Bay in Singapore has been transformed into a mystical realm during this event.

He spent much of his final days on Ocracoke Island until his death in 1718. The island's residents speak the unique 'Hoi Toider' dialect, a blend of Elizabethan English, Irish and Scottish accents.

Meticulously carved from yellow sandstone blocks, these cenotaphs showcase the elegance of Rajasthani architecture, combining elements of Hindu and Islamic styles. Embellished with exquisite paintings, sculptures and inscriptions, these were built in four distinct sizes, each reflecting the royal hierarchy.\nThe story of this site begins with Jait Singh II, a descendant of Maharawal Jaisal Singh, the founder of Jaisalmer State. In the 16th century, he commissioned a dam that created a water tank, turning the surrounding barren landscape into a lush area. After his passing, his son, Lunkaran, established a garden by the lake and erected a memorial chhatri on a hill overlooking it. Over the years, more cenotaphs were added for Lunkaran and other members of the clan. The last chhatri, dedicated to Maharawal Jawahir Singh, remains unfinished.",

Sea otters are native to the northern and eastern coasts of the North Pacific Ocean. Weighing 13–45 kilograms, they're expert foragers, diving to the seabed to find food. These clever critters are smart as well as cute: they use rocks to crack open shellfish, making them one of the few animals that use tools. There used to be as many as 300,000 in the wild, but they were heavily hunted for almost two centuries, as their dense fur was highly prized. By 1911, it is thought that only around 2,000 were left. Thankfully, an international hunting ban, conservation efforts and reintroduction programs have helped them rebound, and they are now found in about two-thirds of their historic habitat. Despite this success, some populations are still struggling, and sea otters are still an endangered species.",

World Space Week is a celebration of all the science and technology that go into exploring and researching our universe, and how it benefits us back on Earth. As well as helping us to understand the universe we live in, space exploration has played an important role in helping scientists develop new medicines, create new power sources and even improve farming techniques. This year's theme is Space and Climate Change; events will be held in 83 countries to celebrate the vital role that space technology plays in understanding and monitoring how Earth's climate is changing.\nSpace exploration has also led to amazing photographs of our solar system, like the one featured here today. Europa is one of Jupiter's 95 known moons. Its surface is mainly made up of frozen water, which has broken up and refrozen, creating the patterns seen on its surface. In fact, although Europa is just a quarter of the size of Earth, it may contain two times the amount of water found in our planet's oceans. Space Week is the perfect time to take a moment to appreciate the wonders of our solar system, and beyond!",

Through gentle nudging, vocalisations and demonstrations, elephant mothers pass down vital knowledge that helps their young survive in the wild. Sadly, these precious animals face significant threats from habitat loss and poaching. As we admire these majestic creatures and strive to protect them, we can learn valuable lessons about empathy, cooperation and the importance of community.\nToday's image features the Tsavo East National Park, Kenya. This park, situated in Kenya's Taita-Taveta County, covers an impressive 13,747 square kilometres. Established in April 1948, this park encompasses a semi-arid region formerly known as the Taru Desert. Along with Tsavo West National Park, it creates a sprawling conservation area of roughly 22,000 square kilometres. Renowned as a global hotspot for biodiversity, Tsavo East offers a pristine sanctuary for a wide variety of wildlife.",

Octopuses are cephalopods, marine animals like squids and cuttlefish that have tentacles. Among their many species is the mototi octopus, pictured here. It was discovered in 1999 around Rapa Island in the South Pacific and is known for the 'fake eyes' or ocelli—vibrant blue and yellow rings—between its eyes and arms. Found in the Indo-Pacific region, including Indonesia, Australia and Okinawa in Japan, mototi octopuses are masters of disguise. They usually have a dull orange-cream-brown colour but when alarmed, they can quickly shift to striking maroon with white stripes along their body and arms. Also known as poison ocellate octopuses, these cephalopods are highly venomous. But you don't need to worry about running into one, because they tend to be shy and solitary, often hiding in crevices, shells or man-made objects like bottles and cans.",

		"description": "Slender white trunks reaching skyward and leaves fluttering even in the gentlest breeze—aspen trees are a symbol of the American wilderness. Found across the western states, especially in Utah and Colorado, these trees are the most widespread native species in North America. Their fall foliage is breathtaking, with their leaves turning a vibrant yellow that lights up the landscape, as seen in today's photo, which was taken near Marble, Colorado, USA.\nAspens are not only beautiful but also biologically fascinating. They grow in large colonies that originate from a single root system, making them some of the largest living organisms on Earth. Each tree in the colony is genetically identical. When an aspen tree is cut down or damaged, the root system remains alive, allowing new shoots to emerge and grow, which helps create a resilient network that can survive harsh conditions, including wildfires. This species quickly colonises areas that have been recently burnt down and can regenerate even after frequent fires. Aspen trees are more than just a treat for the eyes; they are an example of nature's resilience.",

Wood ducks, like the one in today's image, nest in tree cavities close to water and sometime take advantage of man-made boxes.\nThey typically breed in wooded swamps, shallow lakes, marshes, ponds and creeks throughout the eastern United States, the west coast, parts of southern Canada and Mexico's west coast. Sometimes, they nest as far as a mile from their water source. The females use feathers and other soft materials to line their nests, which are usually elevated, offering some protection from predators like raccoons, owls and hawks. During the breeding season, from February to April, you'll find the females laying 7–15 eggs. After breeding in the eastern and western United States and southern Canada, these ducks migrate southward in the fall to avoid harsh winter conditions. By October and November, they move towards milder climates in the southeastern United States and occasionally into Mexico.",

The Royal Alcázar of Seville, in the southern region of Andalusia, stands on the site of a 10th century citadel, which was expanded over the following 200 years. When Christian forces captured the city in 1248, the Alcázar was almost totally rebuilt in the Mudejar style, which takes inspiration from the intricate patterns and decorative motifs found in Islamic architecture. Within the Alcázar, there are several courtyards lined with delicately carved columns. One of these is the Patio de las Doncellas, or Courtyard of the Maidens, pictured here today.\nIn the centre of this beautiful space is a pool, whose still waters provide reflections of not only the blue Andalucian sky above, but of the intricate latticework of the courtyard's arches. Look a little closer at these arches, and you'll see carved shells, Hands of Fatima—a symbol said to bring protection—plants and Arabic script. Behind the columns, the walls are decorated with colourful ceramic times decorated with geometric patterns. These tiles, known as azulejos, are a hallmark of Andalusian decoration. Outside, there is a large garden, full of fountains and tree-lined paths—a perfect spot to cool off from the hot Spanish sun.",

Every July, roughly 2 million of these determined grazers, along with zebras and other herbivores, set off on a journey to the Maasai Mara in Kenya in search of lush pastures and fresh water.\nThe great migration, considered one of the seven wonders of the natural world, is a safari spectacle where survival is the prize. One of the most dramatic moments of the migration is the crossing of the Mara River. Thousands of wildebeests gather at the riverbank, aware that danger lurks beneath the surface—the crocodiles—not to mention the lions and leopards that patrol the banks. When the first wildebeest takes the plunge, it's a wild rush as the rest of the herd follows, creating a chaotic scene. Some make it across, while others become part of the food chain. As October rolls around and the rains return to the Serengeti, the herds begin their journey back south, completing the cycle once again.",

Sloths are mainly leaf eaters, although they also snack on fruits and tree sap to keep them going. To help them break down those tough, fibrous leaves, they have a special multi-chambered stomach. With their super slow metabolism, digestion takes its sweet time, and they don't need much food each day to get by. It's not just their stomachs that move at a leisurely pace; they're so slow-moving that algae often develop on their fur, giving a greenish tint, which handily also provides them camouflage.",

Federico Zuccari, who built the palace, was well-versed in monsters. His painting of the Last Judgement in Florence Cathedral and his illustrations of Dante's Inferno are replete with mythical beings.\nThe monster door originally led to the palazzo's garden because Zuccari enjoyed making his guests experience the contrast between the scary entrance and the beautiful serenity of the garden. These days, the door leads to the Bibliotheca Hertziana, a library specialising in Italian art history, from the Middle Ages to the modern day, which has occupied the site of the garden since 1912. If you're looking for more monstrous mouths in Rome, not far from the Palazzo Zuccari is the Bocca della Verità, an ancient Roman mask.

Madame Sherri's dramatic arrivals in town, often in a chauffeur-driven Packard, draped in furs, became the talk of the locals. As her fortune declined, her 'castle' fell into disrepair and was vandalised. In 1959, she returned to find her property in ruins and never came back. A fire destroyed the house in 1963, leaving behind only the stone foundation, an iconic staircase and a large fireplace leading to a lone chimney.\nToday, the forest where her house once stood spans over 2 square kilometres and offers scenic hiking trails through woodlands, hemlock groves and around peaceful brooks, a picturesque setting for outdoor enthusiasts. Managed by the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests, this area was named in honour of Madame Sherri, and it also includes trails that lead to the ruins of her former estate.

		"description": "In the ghostly silence of Bodie in California, United States, it feels like time stands still. This once-booming gold rush town was established in 1860. Bodie was named after W.S. Bodey, a prospector who discovered gold but tragically died in a blizzard before seeing the town's rise. When large deposits of gold were found there, it grew to nearly 10,000 residents, with saloons, dance halls and breweries lining its streets. But as the gold ran dry, so did the town's fortunes. The mines closed, the population dwindled and by 1915, the place was abandoned. Bodie's streets are now empty, its wooden buildings frozen in decay.\nMuch like Bodie, India has its own share of once-thriving places that have fallen into eerie silence, transforming into ghost towns. These were once vibrant, bustling communities full of life, but over time, they were consumed by darkness and loss, leaving only traces of their former glory. Now, these places—like Hampi, Kuldhara, Lakhpat, Mandu and Dhanushkodi—are deserted, cold and haunting, much like Bodie's empty streets and decaying buildings. Stepping into these forgotten towns is like walking into the past, where the echoes of what once was linger in the air.",

		"description": "Glistening like a jewel under the sun, the Golden Temple is not just a place of worship—it's an experience for the soul. A gurudwara in Amritsar, Punjab, it is also known as Sri Darbar Sahib or Sri Harmandir Sahib. The site's journey began in 1577, when Guru Ram Das, the fourth Sikh Guru, completed the man-made pool surrounding the temple. Fast forward to 1604, and it was the fifth Guru, Guru Arjan, who placed the sacred Adi Granth within the temple, shaping its spiritual significance. Despite facing destruction multiple times at the hands of Mughal and Afghan invaders, the Sikhs showed resilience, rebuilding the temple each time.\nIn 1809, Maharaja Ranjit Singh stepped in, giving the temple its present look by reconstructing it with marble and copper, and later, covering its sanctum with gold leaf in 1830—hence the name, Golden Temple. What makes this gurudwara truly special is its unique design. Built lower than the land around, it represents humility and equality. The Golden Temple, with its four entrances on all sides, symbolises its open doors to people of all backgrounds, warmly welcoming everyone regardless of caste, creed or religion.",

In general, 'pumpkins' refer to the mature edible fruits of all five Cucurbita species, which are typically not baked.\nIn India, pumpkins are a popular warm-season fruit that is widely cultivated across the country and goes by different names such as kashiphal, sitaphal or lal kaddu. These fruits come in various shapes, including oblong, round and oval, with weights ranging from 2 to 20 kilograms. The flesh colour varies from pale yellow to deep crimson, and they are normall between 3.5 and 5.5 centimetres thick. Pumpkins are grown extensively for both their immature and mature fruits and hold importance due to their high carotene content and excellent storage life.",

With its keen vision, eerie vocalisations and silent flight, this owl has historically been revered and feared. In folklore and mythology, owls were considered symbols of wisdom and omens of death. On Samhain, the Celtic precursor to Halloween, the owl was believed to be the kin of roaming spirits.\nThe owl in today's image is far more than a character in ghostly tales. Often called the 'tiger of the air,' the great horned owl, named for its signature feathers that look like horns, is one of the most fearsome and adaptable predators in the ornithological world. Primarily active at night, the owl has large, powerful talons that exert around 2,100 kilopascals of pressure, which it uses to grab prey like small rodents and skunks. It has incredible night vision, but its eyes are fixed, so it must turn its head a whopping 270 degrees to see everything. So, whether you hear it hooting from treetops or see it flying in the night, this owl proves that not all scary apparitions are supernatural.",

Also known as Lady Glamis, a noblewoman accused of witchcraft by King James V, she is believed to still lament her fiery execution in 1537. Others say the Grey Lady might be the ghost of Marie de Guise—mother of Mary, Queen of Scots—mourning her lost power amid the turmoil of religious reform. Then there's the Dung Man, a prisoner who attempted to escape in a wheelbarrow full of excrement. He died from the fall when the cart was emptied from the castle wall. The lost piper, who vanished into underground tunnels, continues to play a haunting melody beneath the city. And in 2001, the shadowy figure of a man in a leather apron emerged during a paranormal research project, leaving volunteers with a chilling memory. Spooked yet?",

Now, over 500,000 bison roam again, many in protected areas like Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, United States, featured in today's image. From the buffalo nickel to state flags, they are a deeply embedded symbol in American culture. Bison are North America's largest mammals, and they have been introduced as far away as Russia.

The highlight of the festival is the release of 'khom loi' or 'khom loy'—floating paper lanterns—into the night sky, creating a beautiful sight as the heavens fill with a sea of warm, golden lights. Locals and visitors gather around temples and palaces to send their wishes skyward, hoping for good fortune in the year to come. In addition to the lantern release, the city is adorned with vibrant parades, traditional dance performances and stunning decorations.",

Blind at birth, these little ones are vulnerable in the first few weeks of their lives and depend entirely on their mothers. At around eight weeks old, they meet the rest of the pride.

		"description": "Windswept cliffs, rugged beauty and dramatic ocean views—welcome to Land's End in Cornwall, England. Since ancient Greek times, when it was known as 'Belerion' or 'Place of the Sun' or in Arthurian legends about the lost land of Lyonesse, Land's End has always been a place of fascination. Land's End is the most south-westerly point on mainland Britain. It is most famous for being the starting point or end of charity races which run the length of the island of Great Britain from Land's End to John O'Groats - at Britain's north-easterly tip.",

Among them are the Tre Cime di Lavaredo, or the 'Three Peaks of Lavaredo,' seen on the right in today's image. A part of the Sexten Dolomites in northeastern Italy, they're one of the most famous mountain groups in the Alps. These three peaks—Cima Grande, Cima Ovest and Cima Piccola—are a UNESCO World Heritage Site that captivates adventurers and nature lovers alike. Much like these, India's northern region is home to awe-inspiring mountain ranges like the Himalayas and Karakoram. In these mountains you'll find some of the tallest peaks on the planet, including Mount Kangchenjunga, which holds the title of the world's third-highest peak.",

		"description": "Here's the red poinsettia, one of the plants from the spurge family, Euphorbiaceae. With its striking star-shaped leaves, the poinsettia has become a symbol of Christmas cheer, brightening homes and public spaces during winter. The history of the poinsettia can be traced back to ancient civilisations. The Aztecs, who called it cuetlaxóchitl, used it to make a reddish-purple dye and to treat fevers. But the plant's association with Christmas has roots in Mexican tradition, where it's known as 'la flor de Nochebuena' or 'Holy Night flower.' According to legend, a young girl, unable to afford a gift for Baby Jesus, was inspired to offer humble weeds, which miraculously transformed into the vibrant poinsettias we know today.",

Active only during the day, it has exceptional hearing and can plunge into the snow to capture rodents. With its long, tapered tail and a small head resembling a hawk, the northern hawk-owl is a striking sight. These owls don't migrate, so they can be spotted year-round. However, in winter they may move south from Canada into the northern United States to find food when it's scarce in their regular territory.",

Well, legend has it that Lake Misurina, pictured here, in Italy's Dolomites, was born from the sorrow of a giant named Sorapis. At more than 1,700 metres above sea level, it is the largest natural lake in the Cadore region, with its perimeter stretching more than two kilometres. The area around the lake is known for its beneficial climate, especially for those with respiratory conditions. Its crystal-clear waters and surrounding hotels provide a perfect getaway for up to 500 visitors. The lake played a role in the 1956 Winter Olympics, where it hosted speed skating events on natural ice, and it has even been immortalised in a pop song by singer Claudio Baglioni.",

Seen on the hill in today's image is the Hohensalzburg Fortress, home to the popular Fortress Advent market, brimming with holiday cheer. The streets come alive with parades featuring Krampus and Perchten, unsettling figures central to Austria's cherished folk traditions. When these fearsome characters storm down the streets, half dancing, half stomping, they leave everyone watching with chills. These parades are unlike anything else and are as much a part of Salzburg's Christmas spirit as the soul-soothing Advent Singing.",

		"description": "Step aside, regular beach houses—Reine's little red cabins are here to steal the show. One of the prettiest places in the Lofoten Islands of Norway, Reine is a fishing village with a population of around 300. A trading post since 1775, it has evolved from a commercial hub to become a sought-after tourist destination. The village's waterfront is lined with the traditional fishermen's cabins called rorbu or rorbuer, which are mostly red in colour, as seen in today's image. Once important to fishermen, these cabins have now become a popular pick for tourist rentals. In 1999, German painter Ingo Kühl set up a pop-up studio in a rorbu in Reine, where he painted scenes of the harbour framed by the towering mountain range. This village truly shines in winter, when you have the chance to see the northern lights twinkling in the night sky.",
