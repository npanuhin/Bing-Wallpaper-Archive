		"description": "Put on your tartan and let the bagpipes play—it's St. Andrew's Day! Scotland's national day is a public holiday there—though not everyone takes the day off. A fisherman by trade, St. Andrew was one of Jesus' apostles and a key figure in Christianity. Though he never set foot in Scotland, his influence is immortalised in the country's Saltire flag, which is said to represent the cross on which he was martyred.\nBrought over by Scottish immigrants in Canada, this day reflects the connection between Scotland and Canada. The North British Society of Halifax, Nova Scotia (now known as the Scots Society), was the first group in what would become Canada to celebrate St. Andrew in 1768. Today, the occasion is marked by parades, concerts, storytelling sessions and cultural festivals in communities with strong Scottish ties, such as Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia. Food plays a central role in celebrations, too. Expect hearty servings of Scottish staples like haggis, neeps and tatties (mashed rutabaga and potatoes). To mark this day, we're visiting Kilchurn Castle, one of Scotland's historic landmarks, in the west of the country. Perched on the banks of Loch Awe, the fortress was built in the mid-15th century by Sir Colin Campbell.",

		"description": "New Year's Eve, also known as Old Year's Day, is celebrated around the world with revelry, fireworks and, for some, religious and cultural observances. Many countries celebrate with foods symbolic of prosperity, long life and good fortune for the coming year. At the stroke of midnight, many people sing the Scottish folk song 'Auld Lang Syne' to remember old friends and past experiences. The new year is often personified as a baby, a tradition dating back to the ancient Greeks, and is frequently paired with an old man representing the previous year.\nHave you ever seen Parliament Hill in Ottawa, sparkle brighter than your resolutions? Parliament Hill, a central symbol of Canada's government, transforms into a vibrant spot to ring in the new year. The fireworks display is the highlight of the evening, lighting up the Ottawa River, as seen in today's image. Beyond the dazzling pyrotechnics, there's often music and entertainment that reflects the city's character. The fireworks light up the sky at midnight, drawing both locals and visitors together to celebrate in a shared moment of awe.",

In the past, Europeans would often use the smooth bark of beech trees for writing texts. In fact, in the modern Dutch language, the term for 'book' directly translates as 'beech tree.' As the sun shines through the forest canopy, wild anemones brighten up the woodland with their white petals. These blooms, representing delicate beauty and sincerity, have even starred in masterpieces by artists such as Monet and Vincent van Gogh.",

The area that spreads across 511 square kilometres was recognised as a national park in 1970. The Nuu-chah-nulth First Nations of the region have walked these lands for centuries. Today, seven of the 15 Nuu-chah-nulth tribes have at least 22 small reserves within the park and nine bordering it. Another notable feature of the reserve is the Coastal Western Hemlock Biogeoclimatic Zone. This temperate forest terrain is home to several animal species such as black bears, Vancouver Island cougars and martens.\nThe Broken Group Islands, seen in today's image, are a collection of small islands and islets scattered across Barkley Sound.

They were hunted for their fur, and their 'nuisance' freshwater abodes were destroyed. However, these buck-toothed, paddle-tailed dam builders have been gaining new respect in recent years. These animals have beneficial effects not only on water quality but also on land. With their iron-coated orange incisors, beavers fell trees, diligently constructing not just homes but habitats. Their dams create life-sustaining wetlands for countless species. Meanwhile, their lodges are masterpieces of security and comfort, the entrance strategically submerged to deter predators and provide privacy. The rodents have no trouble getting in, as they can hold their breath for up to 15 minutes. So, 'woodn't' it be nice to give a shout-out to these creatures on International Beaver Day?",

These sandstone balls—a phenomenon known as concretions—formed over millions of years as sedimentary layers built up around a central core of sand and stone held together by mineral cement. Erosion gradually wore away the outer layers to expose the spherical shapes we see today. This created a fascinating spectacle that only appears at low tide. Concretions are rare, and there has been plenty of wild speculation about where they come from, with some believing them to be extraterrestrial debris while others wondering if they are dinosaur fossils.

Lying on a narrow strip of land between two lochs, the site initially comprised 60 stones, although today only 36 remain. The exact purpose of the structure is still unknown; in 2008, an excavation project called the Ring of Brodgar Excavation was undertaken to try to learn more about the site, but the project has not yet reached any conclusive results.

Established in 1934, the park encompasses over 2,114 square kilometres of wilderness. The forests, which cover most of the park, are home to 1,500 species of flowering plants, 952 algae, 65 species of mammals and over 240 species of birds, making it an International Biosphere Reserve.\nCades Cove—seen in today's photo—is a valley within the Great Smoky Mountains National Park renowned for its stunning scenery and historic structures, including log cabins, barns and churches. While exploring the park, you can also visit historical areas like Roaring Fork, Cataloochee and Elkmont. If you wish to watch fireflies, then Elkmont is the place for you and if you are a geologist, there's something for you too: this park is home to late Precambrian rocks. So, set your spirit of adventure free and explore the timeless treasure: national parks!",

		"description": "Today is Earth Day—a day dedicated to celebrating the planet we call home and raising awareness of environmental problems. The seeds of this day were planted back in 1969 when Gaylord Nelson, the then-Wisconsin senator, witnessed events like the Cuyahoga River catching fire and the Santa Barbara oil spill and decided that the world needed an environmental initiative. A year later, the first Earth Day event was held. Now, it has grown into an annual event with more than a billion people in over 193 countries taking part.\nThis year, the campaign's focus is on plastics, which are a particularly serious form of pollution on land and in the oceans. Many species—including this green sea turtle—eat the plastic waste they find in the ocean, mistaking it for food. These same plastics pose an entanglement risk and can also break down to become microplastics. Every year some 25 million tonnes of plastic enter aquatic ecosystems. So, whether you're planting trees, cleaning up beaches or simply spreading the word, let's remember to promote sustainable living. After all, there's no planet B!",

Despite their small size, Adélie penguins are sleek swimmers and can dive as deep as 175 metres in search of shrimp-like krill or fish. They are social animals which gather in small colonies for foraging, hunting and protection.

It came about thanks to the efforts of Anna Jarvis, daughter of Ann Jarvis, a social activist. Jarvis was the one who organised the first Mother's Day service of worship and celebration. On this day, people express gratitude towards their mothers by giving gifts and cards, baking cakes and posting on social media. Well, how about writing a letter to your mother?",

The longest river in the country—the Fish River—has carved out the continent's largest canyon over millions of years. Winding through weathered layers of gneiss and dolomite rocks, the Fish River Canyon is around 160 kilometres long and about 548 metres deep. This popular site attracts adventure seekers with its hiking trail, which runs for 90 kilometres and the Fish River Canyon Ultra Marathon. Moreover, with Hartmann's mountain zebras, klipspringers and Eastern rock elephant shrews, the canyon is teeming with creatures big and small. So, whether you are there for hiking, trekking, camping or just soaking in the scenery, one thing's for sure: Fish River Canyon is a catch you won't soon forget.",

They can beat their wings over 40-50 times per second, enabling them to hover and even fly backwards with ease.\nDuring their courtship, the males exhibit a remarkable performance. They embark on dives, making squeaky sounds to impress their mates. They fly skyward up to 40 metres before plummeting at a breakneck speed of roughly 3 kilometres per hour, emitting a sonic 'whoosh' with their tail feathers. During breeding season, the female builds a round nest of 3-5 centimetres in diameter, where she raises her young alone. So, the next time you're outside, keep an eye—and ear—out for Anna's hummingbird.",

Once you learn to ride, you'll never forget how to wheel around. Thanks to Polish-American scientist Leszek Sibiliski's initiative, the United Nations declared June 3 World Bicycle Day in 2018.\nKarl von Drais, a German inventor, is credited with developing the first two-wheeler, the 'swiftwalker,' in 1817. The machine certainly needed some further thinking, since the wooden frame and wheels didn't have pedals. The modern versions of bikes were developed in the late 1800s, but the materials used for them are still constantly evolving to make the ride easier and more secure. So, hop on a bike to find your crew on Word Bicycle Day!",

The day was June 6, 1944, a date forever etched in time as D-Day. It marked the launch of Operation Overlord, the ambitious Allied invasion that became a turning point in World War II.

One such symbol is Les Braves, a sculpture gracing Omaha Beach. French artist Anilore Banon's design features three sections called 'Wings of Hope', 'Rise, Freedom!' and 'Wings of Fraternity'.

The Registan Square is encircled by three Islamic schools, namely the Ulugh Beg Madrasah, the Sher-Dor Madrasah and the Tilya-Kori Madrasah, characterised by the Islamic architectural style, which typically features elaborate repetitive patterns and ornamental forms.

This megacity on the Ganges Delta, home to over 10.2 million people, is one of the most densely populated cities on the planet. Once known as Jahangirnagar after ruling emperor Jahangir, Dhaka was the provincial capital of the Mughal Empire for 75 years in total. Dhaka has been nicknamed 'City of Mosques' because of the hundreds of elegant minarets that dot the city.\nHere, the cheers from football and cricket stadiums fill the air, and rickshaws, painted with colourful floral patterns, meander through the streets. UNESCO has even recognised the city's rickshaw art as the intangible cultural heritage of humanity. Watch out though, even if you're travelling in a stylishly painted rickshaw, it might take you a while to reach your destination: Dhaka has been recognised as the world's slowest city! Whether you're weaving through its alleys on a rickshaw or sampling its spicy street foods, Dhaka is sure to move you, quite literally! Dhaka awaits with open arms and a steaming cup of tea.",

		"description": "You might have seen lakes with some unique colours before, but the Indonesian island of Flores, with its volcano Kelimutu, may steal the show. Home to three lakes, each with its own hue and folklore, this natural wonder attracts travellers seeking an otherworldly experience. Volcanic vents deep within the Earth release steam and gas, which alter the lakes' mineral compositions, causing reactions that transform their appearance periodically.\nEach lake at Kelimutu has its own unique chemical makeup, which is why they can be different colours from each other at the same time and these colours can change independently. The westernmost lake, Tiwu Ata Bupu (Lake of Old People), normally has a blue hue. Meanwhile, Tiwu Ko'o Fai Nuwa Muri (Lake of Young Men and Maidens) tends to be green and Tiwu Ata Polo (Bewitched or Enchanted Lake) is usually red. The local Lio people revere these lakes, believing them to be the resting place of souls. So, why settle for the usual beachside vacation when you can explore a trio of colour-changing lakes?",

It is likely they practised hunting and performed religious ceremonies in this area. If you are a history buff, you might want to try and decode the cryptic messages carved on the rock faces.

Cardinalfish can grow up to 8 centimetres and have tiny shimmery bodies with black vertical stripes and white-edged fins, which help them disguise. Unlike some finned creatures that migrate long distances, these pint-sized fish inhabit a small world, rarely straying far from their local reefs.\nEach young cardinalfish begins life being guarded by their fathers, who carry the eggs in their mouths for up to 30 days to shield them from the aquatic perils. Within these jaws, young fish embark on a silent metamorphosis, soon to emerge, ready to explore the currents. In their early stages, they form dense schools for protection against predators and hide among the spines of sea urchins and anemones. The diet of these opportunistic feeders primarily consists of small fish, crustaceans and plankton. Their existence whispers tales of resilience—a creature to cherish and protect for the spectacle of life it presents.",

More than just a church, this Gothic structure, with its red-tiled dome, is steeped in centuries of history. Built over an older cathedral dedicated to Santa Reparata, construction began in 1296 under the supervision of architect Arnolfo di Cambio. Filippo Brunelleschi, an Italian architect and designer, engineered its dome, which is the largest brick dome ever constructed. It was built without the support of traditional wooden frameworks; its completion in 1436 was the final stage of the cathedral's construction.\nIt's not just the outside that dazzles; inside there are artistic treasures to discover, from Giorgio Vasari's fresco 'The Last Judgement' to Paolo Uccello's intricate clock face. The cathedral complex is also home to the Baptistery, a small basilica and Giotto's Campanile, a free-standing bell tower. Step inside and you're walking on history—every visit gives a glimpse of the past and a demonstration of human potential.",

At the time, homosexuality was illegal, and raids against LGBTQIA+ establishments were common. However, on that night, the patrons of the Stonewall Inn, fed up with the continued harassment, decided to stand their ground. Violence escalated, leading to clashes between protesters and police. In the following days, there was more rioting as people gathered to protest the raids.\nOn June 28 the following year, gay pride marches were held in New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago to mark the anniversary of the riots. Similar marches soon started to be held annually in hundreds of places across the US and the rest of the world. June 28 is now celebrated as International LGBTQIA+ Pride Day. In 2016, the Stonewall Inn, Christopher Park and several nearby streets were officially dedicated as the Stonewall National Monument. So, today is the perfect time to remember those who have fought for LGBTQIA+ rights before, during and after Stonewall.",

Within its glass and granite façade, the gallery houses a collection of over 93,000 artworks, including masterpieces of Canadian and Indigenous art, European classics and more.

Its most emblematic feature is the amphitheatre, seen in today's image. One of the largest in the Roman Empire, it could accommodate up to 25,000 spectators, more than double the city's population. Beyond this, there are remains of impressive public buildings, a temple built in honour of Trajan, baths and villas decorated with stunning mosaics.

But don't be fooled by their names; meerkats are not cats. They're small carnivores of the mongoose family, native to the deserts and grasslands of southwestern Africa. Meerkats are highly social animals, living in tight-knit groups called mobs, which can consist of up to 30 individuals. These groups are a cooperative effort, with meerkats foraging together, grooming each other, babysitting and taking turns as sentinels to watch for predators. These critters create extensive burrows where they spend the night and retreat to escape the midday heat–meerkats love their afternoon siesta.\nWorld Meerkat Day, founded at Taronga Western Plains Zoo in Australia on July 3, 2018, is celebrated all over the world. This day aims to raise awareness about meerkats and their ecological importance. Classed as 'least concern' on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species, these tiny mammals are vital for controlling insect populations in their desert habitats.

There are three types of rock: igneous are formed from solidified magma and lava; sedimentary rocks are layers of sedimentary particles such as sand; and metamorphic rocks are the result of heat and pressure on other kinds of rock.\nToday's image takes us to Cappadocia in central Türkiye, and its stony structures known as fairy chimneys. These cone-shaped pillars are made of tuff, a sedimentary rock that forms as volcanic ash and debris accumulates. On the sides of the rocks, ancient residents of the area carved homes and churches. The area is also famous for its underground cities, which were cut out of the tuff to provide shelter and safety. This is just one of the many uses for rocks that humans have come up with throughout history.",

Japan is made up of 14,125 islands and has 29,751 kilometres of coastline, so it's no wonder the sea plays such a key role in national life. As well as providing much of the country's food, the seas that surround Japan are vital for trading and communicating with other nations.\nTo celebrate this day, many people take a trip to the beach. Another Marine Day tradition is to give something back to the ocean by throwing mudballs into the water; these balls are packed with microorganisms that help to purify the sea. Today's image takes us to Tateishi Park in Yokosuka. This scenic spot has stunning views of Sagami Bay and Mount Fuji, making it the perfect place to celebrate Japan's coastal waters on Marine Day.",

This landscape houses a treasure trove of fossils dating back over 75 million years, offering scientists and visitors a glimpse into the Late Cretaceous period.\nThe first fossil discovered in this park was of an Albertosaurus in 1884, which led to an excavation that uncovered approximately 500 species, including the fossils of Tyrannosaurus rex and Centrosaurus. The sediments exposed in the badlands, seen in today's image, have been around for over 1.5 million years.

The growth of Rothenburg ob der Tauber slowed in the 17th century, preserving its original character. Pictured here is Burgtor or the castle gate, which was built after the original Rothenburg Castle was destroyed by an earthquake in 1356.\nWithin the castle gate is an 'eye-of-the-needle' door, designed to be the only way in and out of the castle when the main gates closed at night. But Rothenburg's magic isn't confined to its walls. It's also a gateway to the 460-kilometre Romantic Road that runs from Würzburg to Füssen, covering Bavaria's castle-studded valleys.

Running from July 15 to 21, Coral Reef Awareness Week is the perfect time to honour them. Coral reefs are formed by tiny marine organisms called coral polyps, which create vast colonies that serve as homes to a diverse array of marine species. As we turn our attention to their beauty and benefits, it's vital to recognise the lurking threats–climate change, pollution and harmful human activities.\nPictured here is Mayotte, a paradise beneath the Indian Ocean's surface. This French Island boasts one of the world's largest and deepest lagoons, encircled by a coral reef of nearly 160 kilometres long. Mayotte's lagoon is home to over 250 species of coral and over 3,500 marine species. But it is facing numerous threats, including overfishing and coral bleaching, where corals expel the algae that live in their tissues, leading to a loss of colour and essential energy sources. So, this week, let's pledge to preserve coral reefs like this one. Dive in, because every splash counts.",

Jaguars arrived in the Americas some 2 million years ago, migrating from Eurasia through the Bering Strait. Today, they inhabit diverse habitats, from the woodlands of the southwestern United States to the rainforests of northern Argentina.\nOften found near bodies of water, jaguars are excellent swimmers, ambushing prey by leaping into the water. True carnivores, jaguars rely exclusively on meat for their nutritional needs. They feed on a wide range of animals, including deer, armadillos, monkeys and lizards. Their strong teeth and jaws can also bite through turtle shells and crocodile heads. In the Brazilian Pantanal, a small population of jaguars primarily feeds on aquatic reptiles and fish. So, the next time you are on a jungle trail, keep your eyes peeled and your senses sharp–remember: every rustle of leaves could be a jaguar on the prowl!",

Initially celebrated as National Moon Day in the United States, the day was recognised globally by the United Nations in 2021. Human civilisations have gazed at the sky for millennia, contemplating the origins and mysteries of the moon. The advent of space exploration transformed the moon into the target of numerous missions.\nApollo 11, the pioneering space mission that first landed humans on the moon, was launched on July 16, 1969. It culminated in the astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin taking the first steps on the moon on July 20, 1969. Moon Day commemorates this historic event and serves as a reminder of the significant efforts required to launch the space program. Moon missions have found no signs of life, but it could be a future site for human colonisation. The discovery of water ice, especially in the dark craters at the poles, makes it more hospitable for potential settlers. So, until you have a chance to live there, keep dreaming under the same moon that has captivated humanity since time immemorial.",

Invented by the Indigenous peoples of Central and South America, hammocks were called 'Hamacas' and were originally woven for sleep and relaxation. Back then hammocks were made from the bark of trees, whereas now they can be made of various materials like cotton, nylon and canvas.\nHammocks come in different shapes and sizes, like Nicaraguan hammocks, which are usually made of woven material with a wooden spreader bar. These sleeping swings have sailed across oceans as sailor beds, swung from the trees as forest dwellers' bedrooms and nowadays, add a touch of chill to hip outdoor retreats. They have health benefits, too; gentle rocking can improve your sleep and even relieve stress. So go ahead, jump into a hammock, and let it gently sway your worries away for a while.",

It now offers refuge to diverse wildlife, like the mountain bluebird, elk, mule deer, white-tailed deer and Canadian goose. The park covers an area of 6,641 square kilometres.\nThe Canadian geese can be recognised by their black heads and white cheek patches, which are also known as 'chinstraps.' They are resilient travellers, enduring thousands of kilometres of migration, flying in a V-shaped formation. While in Banff National Park, you might come across geese teaching their goslings to navigate the waters. It is not just a park; it's a theatre where nature is on display.",

These limestone bridges, towering over a deep gorge, are named after three dragons: Tianlong (Sky Dragon), Qinglong (Azure Dragon) and Heilong (Black Dragon). Tianlong, standing at 235 metres, has a bridge-pier with maze-like caves in it. The Qinglong Bridge, which is 281 metres high, offers breathtaking views when the sun is out. Heilong Bridge is the widest of the three bridges at 193 metres and reaches a height of 223 metres. Visitors can explore the Wulong Karst National Geology Park and visit places like the Furong Cave, a 2,846-metre cave with huge limestone stalactites, which are mineral formations that hang from the ceiling. Standing beneath these magnificent natural bridges, you can't help but be humbled by the sheer power of time and nature.",

This event began in 1930 when Hallmark Cards founder Joyce Hall proposed it as a day for people to acknowledge their friends by sending greeting cards. From exchanging friendship bracelets to sharing social media posts and messages, Canadians have come up with their own special traditions to appreciate their pals.\nThis is a good day to reflect on the many ways friendship impacts our lives, much like the symbiotic relationship between the impala and the red-billed oxpecker, pictured here in South Africa. Both these animals get something out of this relationship: the oxpecker gets food by eating ticks from the impala's skin, while the impala gets to stay clean. This animal duo showcases nature's version of companionship. So, reach out to your friends to express gratitude and simply say, 'I appreciate you.'",

It was also treasured by the Romans for its healing and cleansing properties.\nLavender is planted during the spring season, reaching its peak bloom in July. It doesn't just look good, it smells great too, and is said to help people relax. The fragrant oil is a staple in wellness practices, including aromatherapy, where it's used for stress relief and is a valued ingredient in the perfume industry. This plant is also used in the kitchen, adding a floral touch to dishes and drinks. So, next time you feel stressed let a few drops of the lavender essential oil calm you down.",

The islet is all that remains of a volcano that erupted about 230,000 years ago. According to Hawaiian mythology, Pele the fire goddess was in love with a man named Mo'o. The trouble was that Mo'o was in love with another woman. Pele's revenge was typically violent: she cut her rival in two, her body becoming Molokini, while her head became Pu'u Olai, a cinder cone on Maui.\nMolokini Crater these days is a prime scuba and snorkelling destination; the islet's crescent shape protects divers from waves and currents, allowing them to enjoy the reef. This habitat is home to at least 250 species of fish, including black triggerfish and parrotfish, as well as 38 species of hard coral and some 100 species of algae. So, come on in, the water's lovely. Just be sure not to anger Pele.",

With piercing yellow eyes against a grey-brown face, spotted owlets are often seen when small birds spot them during the day and mob them. Once located, these primarily nocturnal owls will often stare down intruders, bob their heads and emit a loud 'chirurrr-chirurrr-chirurrr' screech, or what's sometimes described as laughter or chuckling.\nStanding around 21 centimetres tall, speckle-plumed spotted owlets can be found from Iran to Vietnam. This one was photographed in Bangkok, Thailand. They primarily eat insects and small mammals like bats and mice, which they often store to eat later when food is scarce. Spotted owlets are a remarkably resilient species that flourish in environments such as semi-deserts, rocky areas, forests, farmlands and urban areas. While they aren't endangered, the spotted owlet's population is thought to have declined in the last four years, perhaps owing to loss of habitat and increased urbanisation.",

One of the major challenges they face is the loss of their languages: it's estimated that of the 4,000 Indigenous languages in the world, around 2,600 are in danger of becoming extinct.\nIn the city of Cusco, Peru, the stone walls of Sacsayhuamán, seen in today's image, murmur tales of the mighty Inca civilisation. The Quechua word Sacsayhuamán means 'the place where the hawk is satisfied'. The citadel's walls, which extended over 540 metres, were built in the 15th century CE. The boulders used to make them were carved and placed without mortar. After the Inca Empire was defeated at a battle here in 1536, Sacsayhuamán was dismantled by the Spanish and the rest of the structure was covered in earth. It was rediscovered in 1934 when the site was excavated. On this day, let's learn the importance of preserving Indigenous cultures and wisdom, as we honour the Indigenous peoples.",

In 2009, the British Cave Research Association led an expedition to explore the site. It was then that they realised something incredible: it was the world's largest cave. How large, you ask? Hang Sơn Đoòng's main passage is 5 kilometres long, 150 metres wide and 200 metres high. That's tall enough to fit a 40-storey skyscraper! Inside, there is a 60-metre calcite barrier called the 'Great Wall of Vietnam' and stalagmites stretching as tall as 80 metres.\nIt even has its own weather system; clouds form inside the cave due to temperature differences between the cave air and the outside air. Moreover, a subterranean river links Hang Sơn Đoòng to the nearby Hang Thung cave, suggesting yet undiscovered depths.

Rockefeller Jr. The park is home to a virtually untouched ecosystem of plants and animals, such as grizzly bears, wolves, bison, moose and bald eagles.\nJust 16 kilometres south of Yellowstone National Park, the park's 64-kilometre-long Teton Range is one of North America's youngest mountain ranges. At less than 10 million years old, erosion has had little geological time to smooth the edges of the mountains, hence the Tetons' jagged peaks. Like its peaks, many of the park's lakes, including the 24-kilometre-long Jackson Lake, were carved out by glaciers hundreds of thousands of years ago.

Ocean City was a quiet fishing village until 1875, when the Atlantic Hotel opened its doors, marking the town's transformation into a burgeoning resort destination. Now, this coastal village is known among travellers from far and wide, including us Canadians seeking sunnier climes. The town's iconic four-kilometre-long boardwalk is lined with restaurants, shops and amusement parks. Pristine sandy beaches that stretch for 16 kilometres are perfect for sunbathing, beach volleyball or building sandcastles, and the ocean waters beckon for a refreshing swim. With plenty of adventure and a heritage deeply rooted in history, Ocean City is a charming retreat that draws visitors back time and again.",

Built between the 10th and 13th centuries, this remarkable site served as a Hindu temple dedicated to the god Shiva. It is on the rim of an extinct volcano, offering views of the surrounding paddy fields and the towering Dongrek Mountains of Cambodia in the distance.\nWith its earthen terraces, the promenade is one of the most striking features in this park filled with intricate stone carvings. Ahead of the promenade is the Phlab Phla, believed to be a bathing area used by royalty before entering the temple that we see here today. Next to it is a passage that stretches on for more than 150 metres, lined with sandstone pillars, which leads to the first of three naga (mythical serpent) bridges that symbolise the transition from the mortal realm to the divine. At the top, the beautifully preserved shrine showcases a wealth of religious motifs, including sculptures of Hindu stories. The annual festival of Phanom Rung, held in April, attracts many who gather to witness the sun's rays aligning with the 15 doorways of the temple and lighting up the inner sanctum.",

The region played a significant role in Maine's logging industry for more than 100 years, but towards the end of the 19th century, this activity began to decline. Efforts to preserve the landscape we see here today were spearheaded by philanthropist Roxanne Quimby. She and her foundation started purchasing land near Baxter State Park in 2001 and donated it to the US federal government in 2016, ensuring its preservation for future generations.\nKatahdin Woods and Waters' diverse ecosystem provides a home for a variety of fauna, including moose, black bear and Canada lynx, in addition to numerous bird species like bald eagle and wood duck. It offers many outdoor activities for visitors, such as hiking, canoeing and camping. The monument has some of the darkest skies in the country due to the lack of electrical lighting in its vast expanse, making it a great place for stargazing.",

These carnivorous creatures thrive in freshwater environments such as slow-moving rivers, lakes and seasonally flooded savannahs. From these waters, they hunt for birds, fish, turtles and occasionally big mammals. Black caimans play an important role in making sure ecosystems stay balanced by keeping their prey's populations under control.

In 1428, a major earthquake struck the area, which was felt in Barcelona more than 80 kilometres away.

These gentle giants have been around for more than 240 million years, but the first specimen was discovered off the coast of South Africa in the 1820s. As the world's largest fish, whale sharks can grow up to 12 metres, with one reaching a record 18.8 metre. Found in tropical oceans around the world, these filter feeders glide through the water, mouth wide open, straining plankton and small fish. Each pattern on their dotted, starry skin is as unique as a human fingerprint.\nSadly, the International Union for Conservation of Nature lists whale sharks as endangered due to overfishing, habitat loss and climate change. Amid adversity, there's hope, like in Cenderawasih Bay in Indonesia, a whale shark oasis that's pictured here. Here, these titans dine on the generosity of fishermen who feed them baitfish for luck, reflecting a unique bond between man and marine life.",

They feature a striking staircase formation, with a two-step cascade created by three layers of basalt.\nBefore these falls became the spot we know today, they had quite a journey. Spanish explorer Alvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca might have been the first European to see the falls. In 1907, businessman Domingo Ayarragaray saw the potential of this area and built a hotel and roads. The falls became such a sensation that they were designated as national parks in both countries—Argentina's Iguazu National Park in 1934 and Brazil's Iguaçu National Park in 1939.

Agile, adaptable and mostly nocturnal, it roams from dense forests to urban playgrounds.\nAt dusk, the red fox sets out on solitary hunts, producing 12 different ranges of vocalisations, from sharp barks to eerie howls. It deftly pursues a diet of rodents, birds and even fruits. An aspect of its interaction is the 'gekkering' it exhibits, a chatter-like sound used mostly in aggressive encounters. Its communication extends beyond sound; the red fox's tail serves as a signal flag to convey different messages to other foxes. It's a subtle and skilfully nuanced language that echoes through the wild.",

Dolphins are highly intelligent and can be found all over the world in oceans, rivers and estuaries. Despite being able to exist in an array of environments and water temperatures, dolphins are threatened by a variety of human activities, such as hunting, pollution and fishing. Hunting in particular led to the creation of World Dolphin Day in 2022 by Sea Shepherd Global, an international marine conservation group.\nThe pod of dolphins seen in today's image was photographed near Réunion, an island in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Madagascar. A wide variety of marine wildlife can be found year-round in Réunion's deeper waters, including many types of sharks, orcas, humpback whales, sea turtles and of course, dolphins. The island's warm, tropical climate is ideal for these creatures, and spinner, bottlenose and rough-toothed dolphins swim in the island's crystal-clear waters.",

With a height of 30 to 105 centimetres, wallabies have strong hind legs that help them take impressive leaps and serve as a defence against predators. During mating season, male wallabies engage in boxing bouts to show dominance in an attempt to grab females' attention. Social creatures, wallabies form small groups called 'mobs,' which provide safety and mutual grooming. Their playgrounds are forests that echo with the thudding of their hops as they navigate their home range with ease.",

		"description": "Autumn is in the air—officially. The September equinox marks the transition from the lush summer to the mellow fall in the Northern Hemisphere, while in the Southern Hemisphere, it signals the beginning of spring. The term 'equinox' is derived from Latin, meaning 'equal night.' During this moment, the Earth's axis is perpendicular to the sun, meaning it rises due east and sets due west, a rare moment of global balance. This balance occurs because the Earth's axis is neither tilted toward nor away from the sun.\nLet's explore Buttermere in England's Lake District which mirrors this equinox enchantment with its tranquil waters and storied shores in today's image. Here, a Norse leader, Jarl Buthar, once defied Norman conquests during the 12th century. Some people think Buttermere's name may come from Buthar, but the more likely explanation is the nearby dairy pastures; Buttermere literally means 'the lake by the dairy pastures.' The lake, approximately 2 kilometres long, is not only a National Trust treasure but also the perfect place to take a break from the hustle and let nature refresh your spirit.",

The otter featured in today's image was photographed in Prince William Sound, Alaska, United States. Sea otters are native to the northern and eastern coasts of the North Pacific Ocean. Weighing 14 to 45 kilograms, they're expert foragers, diving to the seabed to find food. These clever critters are smart as well as cute: they use rocks to crack open shellfish, making them one of the few animals that use tools. There used to be as many as 300,000 in the wild, but they were heavily hunted for almost two centuries, as their dense fur was highly prized.\nBy 1911, it is thought that only around 2,000 were left. Thankfully, an international hunting ban, conservation efforts and reintroduction programs have helped them rebound and they are now found in about two-thirds of their historic habitat. Today, the British Columbia sea otter population is not just surviving but flourishing, with numbers increasing each year. However, there is still a need for awareness as they face threats like oil spills, accidents and pollution. So, whenever you glimpse their fuzzy heads bobbing in the waves, remember, you're witnessing a story of nature's triumph.",

		"description": "There's a reason why famed American photographer Ansel Adams fell in love with Yosemite National Park: vistas like today's image of Half Dome. Located in central California's Sierra Nevada mountain range, the park has been a popular destination for artists, mountaineers, settlers and nature lovers since the mid-1800s. To preserve the area and protect it from logging and overgrazing by cattle, the US Congress designated Yosemite a national park on this day in 1890. It's one of the most visited parks in the United States, with annual attendance exceeding 3 million, and it's a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nAt almost 2,696 metres tall, Half Dome—named because it looks like a dome that's been cut in half—is only one of Yosemite's geological wonders. Other famous climbing destinations include El Capitan and Mount Lyell, which at 3,997 metres tall is the park's highest summit. Yosemite is also famous for its waterfalls and is home to giant sequoia trees, black bears, mountain lions and endangered Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep.",

On the banks of the Yamuna River in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India, this ivory-white marble mausoleum will certainly leave an impression. The Taj, seen in today's image, was commissioned in 1631 by Shah Jahan, the fifth Mughal emperor, to honour his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal. This tomb is the centrepiece of a huge complex, which also includes a mosque, a guest house and beautifully landscaped gardens surrounded by a grand wall. Laid out in a striking rectangular shape, the tomb is flanked by giant arches and alcoves that merge Indo-Islamic and Mughal architectural styles. This mausoleum draws inspiration from notable structures such as the Gur-e Amir in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, and Humayun's Tomb and Shah Jahan's Jama Masjid in Delhi.\nIt's also an incredible architectural feat, with the outer dome reaching around 44 metres and the inner one standing more than 24 metres.

Found in the Indo-Pacific region, including Indonesia, Australia and Okinawa in Japan, mototi octopuses are masters of disguise. They usually have a dull orange-cream-brown colour but when alarmed, they can quickly shift to striking maroon with white stripes along their body and arms. Also known as poison ocellate octopuses, these cephalopods are highly venomous.

These trees are the most widespread native species in North America, with Pando, located in Utah's Fishlake National Forest, being a massive quaking aspen grove. Their fall foliage is breathtaking, with their leaves turning a vibrant yellow that lights up the landscape, as seen in today's photo, which was taken near Marble, Colorado.\nAspens are not only beautiful but also biologically fascinating. They grow in large colonies that originate from a single root system, making them some of the largest living organisms on Earth. Each tree in the colony is genetically identical. When an aspen tree is cut down or damaged, the root system remains alive, allowing new shoots to emerge and grow, which helps create a resilient network that can survive harsh conditions, including wildfires. This species quickly colonises areas that have been recently burned down and can regenerate even after frequent fires. Closer to home. the Aspen parkland is an ecological region that —retches across 397,304 square kilometres, covering parts of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. Aspen trees are more than just a treat for the eyes; they are an example of nature's resilience.",

The bar-tailed godwit embarks on an 11,000-kilometre nonstop flight across the Pacific from Alaska to New Zealand. The tiny ruby-throated hummingbird, weighing less than a nickel, makes the trip across the Gulf of Mexico—a seemingly impossible feat for its size. Migratory birds navigate the globe, instinctively knowing when and where to move to exploit seasonal abundance. The Arctic tern outshines them all with its intercontinental journey from pole to pole, covering 30,000 kilometres. Their migration routes are passages created based on environmental cues.\nLet's take a moment to admire the vibrant plumage of the wood duck, photographed in Quebec, and featured here today. Wood ducks, like the one in today's image, nest in tree cavities close to water and sometimes take advantage of man-made boxes. During the breeding season, from February to April, you'll find the females laying 7–15 eggs. After breeding in the eastern and western United States and southern Canada, these ducks migrate southward in the fall to avoid harsh winter conditions.

Within the Alcázar, there are several courtyards lined with delicately carved columns. One of these is the Patio de las Doncellas, or Courtyard of the Maidens, pictured here today.\nIn the centre of this beautiful space is a pool, whose still waters provide reflections of not only the blue Andalucian sky above, but of the intricate latticework of the courtyard's arches. Look a little closer at these arches, and you'll see carved shells, Hands of Fatima—a symbol said to bring protection—plants and Arabic script. Behind the columns, the walls are decorated with colourful ceramic times decorated with geometric patterns. These tiles, known as 'azulejos,' are a hallmark of Andalusian decoration.

One of the most dramatic moments of the migration is the crossing of the Mara River. Thousands of wildebeests gather at the riverbank, aware that danger lurks beneath the surface—the crocodiles—not to mention the lions and leopards that patrol the banks. When the first wildebeest takes the plunge, it's a wild rush as the rest of the herd follows, creating a chaotic scene. Some make it across, while others become part of the food chain.

Sloths are mainly leaf eaters, although they also snack on fruits and tree sap to keep them going. To help them break down those tough, fibrous leaves, they have a special multi-chambered stomach. With their super slow metabolism, digestion takes its sweet time, and they don't need much food each day to get by. It's not just their stomachs that move at a leisurely pace; they're so slow-moving that algae often develop on their fur, giving a greenish tint, which handily also provides them camouflage.",

In today's image, we're transported to the George L. Smith State Park, which spans 6.61 square kilometres in Emanuel County, Georgia, United States. The park's centrepiece, seen in today's image, is a 1.67 square kilometre mill pond, a favourite spot for fishing and canoeing. Out of its waters grow pond cypress and bald cypress trees, two varieties that are native to the country. Winding through the park are over 11 kilometres of nature trails, leading visitors through sandy landscapes past a bird sanctuary and tortoise habitat.\nIn Canada, the yellow cypress primarily thrives in the coastal mountains of British Columbia, braving the alpine slopes and misty havens, where few other trees dare to grow. Scientifically known as Callitropsis nootkatensis, it is also called Nootka Cypress, named after the Nuu-chah-nulth people of Vancouver Island.",

Down an unassuming side street, there's a surprise waiting for you: a house of monsters. Welcome to the Palazzo Zuccari, a 16th-century palace where myths seem to come to life on its façade—grotesque faces swallow up its doors and windows. Federico Zuccari, who built the palace, was well-versed in monsters. His painting of the Last Judgement in Florence Cathedral and his illustrations of Dante's Inferno are replete with mythical beings.\nThe monster door originally led to the palazzo's garden because Zuccari enjoyed making his guests experience the contrast between the scary entrance and the beautiful serenity of the garden. These days, the door leads to the Bibliotheca Hertziana, a library specialising in Italian art history, from the Middle Ages to the modern day, which has occupied the site of the garden since 1912. If you're looking for more monstrous mouths in Rome, not far from the Palazzo Zuccari is the Bocca della Verità, an ancient Roman mask. According to legend, it will bite off any liar's hand that's placed in its mouth.",

It was once the site of an extravagant house built in the 1930s by Madame Antoinette Sherri, a flamboyant 1920s costume designer known for her lavish parties. Madame Sherri's dramatic arrivals in town, often in a chauffeur-driven Packard, draped in furs, became the talk of the locals. As her fortune declined, her 'castle' fell into disrepair and was vandalised. In 1959, she returned to find her property in ruins and never came back. A fire destroyed the house in 1963, leaving behind only the stone foundation, an iconic staircase and a large fireplace leading to a lone chimney.\nToday, the forest where her house once stood spans over 2 square kilometres and offers scenic hiking trails through woodlands, hemlock groves and peaceful brooks, a picturesque setting for outdoor enthusiasts. Managed by the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests, this area was named in honour of Madame Sherri, and it also includes trails that lead to the ruins of her former estate. So, while the house was originally separate from the forest, the two are now intricately entwined.",

Bodey, a prospector who discovered gold but tragically died in a blizzard before seeing the town's rise. When large deposits of gold were found there, it grew to nearly 10,000 residents, with saloons, dance halls and breweries lining its streets. But as the gold ran dry, so did the town's fortunes. The mines closed, the population dwindled and by 1915, the place was abandoned. Bodie's streets are now empty, its wooden buildings frozen in decay.\nToday, it is one of America's best-preserved ghost towns. Wandering through the streets, you can peer into dusty homes and storefronts and even find small artefacts like shards of china and square nails from the glory days. Legend has it that Bodie's ghosts fiercely guard the town and those who take souvenirs risk being cursed with bad luck. If that doesn't scare you, taking items home is against the park's rules. So, if you find yourself here, be sure to leave with nothing but memories—lest the town's spirits follow you home.",

The towering presence of Mont Blanc, seen in this image, has left an indelible mark on literature, most notably on Mary Shelley's 'Frankenstein.' The last Friday of October is Frankenstein Friday, honouring Shelley's literary genius and the fascinating creature born from her imagination. 'Frankenstein' was conceived during a ghost story challenge. In 1816, an 18-year-old Shelley, along with fellow writers Percy Bysshe Shelley, John Polidori and Lord Byron, spent a stormy summer in Switzerland. There, she penned the tale of Victor Frankenstein and the Creature. A pivotal scene in the novel takes place on a glacier near Mont Blanc, where Victor is confronted by his monstrous creation. This setting, with its surreal beauty and treacherous terrain, perfectly captures a sense of awe and terror.\n'Frankenstein,' also known as 'Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus,' was first published anonymously in 1818. Shelley's use of the epistolary form—a novel told through letters—and her blend of Gothic and early science fiction made 'Frankenstein' a timeless classic.",

In Canada, as Irish immigrants settled, abundant pumpkins became the ideal substitutes for the turnips and potatoes they had previously used to create lanterns. By hollowing out pumpkins and lighting them with candles, they transformed the gourds into flickering defences against evil spirits.\nThe image of a pumpkin field in Victoria, British Columbia, seen today, captures the essence of this season. Every year, from late September to October, the fields of Quebec and the farms of British Columbia are full of this orange fruit. Visitors often flock to these fields for the quintessential pumpkin-picking experience. These gourds become canvases for masterpieces, with ghoulish and whimsical displays adorning porches to welcome trick-or-treaters. As people gather to scoop, carve and light their pumpkins, they participate in a shared ritual that transcends cultures. Beyond their role as porch decorations, pumpkins fill pies and spice up lattes, adding an element to the season that many anticipate all year long. Once merely a fruit, the pumpkin now enjoys a revered place in Halloween celebrations.",

With its keen vision, eerie vocalisations and silent flight, this owl has historically been revered and feared. In folklore and mythology, owls were considered symbols of wisdom and omens of death. On Samhain, the Celtic precursor to Halloween, the owl was believed to be the kin of roaming spirits.\nThe owl in today's image is far more than a character in ghostly tales. Often called the 'tiger of the air,' the great horned owl, named for its signature feathers that look like horns, is one of the most fearsome and adaptable predators in the ornithological world. Primarily active at night, the owl has large, powerful talons that exert huge amounts of pressure, which it uses to grab prey like small rodents and skunks. It has incredible night vision, but its eyes are fixed, so it must turn its head a whopping 270 degrees to see everything. So, whether you hear it hooting from treetops or see it flying in the night, this owl proves that not all scary apparitions are supernatural.",

Positioned high on an extinct volcano, these fortress walls have seen wars, royal births, executions and plenty of other drama since the 11th century. What really sets it apart is its reputation as one of Scotland's most haunted spots. It's no surprise that with more than 1,000 years of history, some have reported ghost sightings.\nLegend has it that the Grey Lady, Janet Douglas, roams the castle's corridors. Also known as Lady Glamis, a noblewoman accused of witchcraft by King James V, she is believed to still lament her fiery execution in 1537. Others say the Grey Lady might be the ghost of Marie de Guise—mother of Mary, Queen of Scots—mourning her lost power amid the turmoil of religious reform. Then there's the Dung Man, a prisoner who attempted to escape in a wheelbarrow full of excrement. He died from the fall when the cart was emptied from the castle wall. The lost piper, who vanished into underground tunnels, continues to play a haunting melody beneath the city. In 2001, the shadowy figure of a man in a leather apron emerged during a paranormal research project, leaving volunteers with a chilling memory. Spooked yet?",

The Caribbean flamingo is the largest flamingo species in the Americas and the only one native to North America. These vibrant birds are typically found around brackish and saltwater areas, like marshes, estuaries and along coastlines. Because of their pink colour, they're often confused with roseate spoonbills. However, their long necks and bent bills distinguish them from other wading birds like the great blue heron and wood stork.",

Over time, Banff's boundaries expanded, and it became part of the Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks UNESCO World Heritage Site. Spanning over 6,600 square kilometres, this national park transforms into a snowy playground during the winter, attracting visitors eager for skiing, snowshoeing, curling, skijoring and wildlife tours that offer plenty to explore. Despite the cold, life thrives in the park: it's home to a variety of wildlife, including elk, grizzly bears, mountain goats and wolves. Lodgepole pines and spruces also stand resilient against harsh weather. Banff's flora and fauna are closely monitored, ensuring that this balance remains intact.",

The story of this otherworldly landscape starts 65 million years ago when a dry seabed stood here. Over time, geological forces warped and squeezed the land, twisting the sandstone into lumps and bumps. Later, wind and water carved out the arches, pinnacles, fins and balanced rocks that now stand in this area. The park has more than 2,000 natural stone arches, the highest concentration of these structures anywhere on Earth. In today's image, we can see two of them: Double Arch, as seen through Cove Arch. The larger arch of Double Arch spans 44 metres and is 34 metres tall, the tallest and second-longest of the park's arches.",

Together, they hold 21% of the world's fresh surface water. Of these, Lake Ontario, standing between the states of Ontaio and New York, has the smallest surface area and was named 'Ontario' by Europeans in 1641. Covering approximately 18,960 square kilometres, it has been an important waterway for centuries. By the 18th century, the lake had become a strategic hub for the fur trade, particularly during the French and Indian War and later the War of 1812. Today, historic forts like Fort Niagara and Fort Henry stand as reminders of these turbulent times near the lake.",

Although it was chosen by Napoleon as the site of his coronation as emperor in 1804, by the early 19th century, the cathedral was in a state of disrepair. However, one novel changed its fortunes: 'The Hunchback of Notre-Dame' by Victor Hugo. The popularity of this book helped encourage a restoration project that renewed the cathedral's former beauty.",

These creatures, part of the same family as camels, alpacas and llamas, are native to the rugged landscapes of South America. Standing around 110 centimetres tall and weighing up to 90 kilograms, guanacos travel in herds led by a dominant male, accompanied by females and their young. After a gestation period of around 11 months, females give birth to a single baby—known as a chulengo—which is able to stand and walk within an hour of birth. Their diet, consisting of grasses, shrubs and lichens, enables them to flourish in harsh, mountainous terrain. Guanaco's soft, warm fur—first introduced for textile use in the mid-1900s—is highly prized. It is used to create luxury fabrics and is valued second only to vicuña wool across the Americas.",

In addition to watching fireworks, drinking champagne and making resolutions in the wee hours of the morning, other global traditions include making noise, eating lucky foods and giving gifts.\nIf you're wondering what polar bears like the ones in today's image have to do with the new year, the answer is simple: polar bear plunges. Countries around the world hold winter events where participants enter frigid, often icy bodies of water and communities in the United States, Canada, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom do this on New Year's Day. Whether doing so as an enthusiast, to raise money for charity or as part of a new year's tradition, keep a warm towel handy if you plan to take the plunge.",

		"description": "Perched on a terrace above the Inn Valley at 1,460 metres, Ardez is a hidden gem in eastern Switzerland renowned for its deep cultural roots and stunning preservation of history. This picturesque village, starring in today's image, showcases the rich traditions and unique language of Switzerland's Romansh-speaking communities. Its homes are adorned with sgraffiti—decorative designs etched into plaster—and colourful murals, both iconic art styles of the Engadin region. Dating back to 840 when it was first referred to as Ardezis, the village's history includes Steinsberg Castle, originally owned by the Bishop of Chur. Though destroyed during the Swabian War in 1499, the castle's tower has been restored multiple times and stands today as a proud reminder of its past. In 1975, Ardez was chosen as a Swiss model village for its exceptional preservation efforts, which have kept its historic charm intact.\nThe nearby Chastè site is a treasure trove of history, recognised as a Swiss heritage site of national significance. This fascinating location encompasses layers of human settlement, from the late Bronze Age through the early Iron Age and even includes artifacts from the Roman Empire. Against this backdrop, the star trails in today's photo illuminate the timeless allure of Ardez, where history and natural beauty converge.",

Today, on Tolkien Day, fans around the world honour the master storyteller who crafted the epic adventures of Middle-earth: J.R.R. Tolkien. While Tolkien may have started the tale, it's his readers who carry it forward, generation after generation, diving into the pages of 'The Hobbit,' 'The Lord of the Rings' and beyond. Tolkienists are encouraged to celebrate the author's birthday with a toast at 9 PM local time—to participate, all you must do is stand and raise a glass of your choice, say 'The Professor,' and take a sip.\nFor today's featured image, it is only fitting to visit a place that might have inspired the literary legend: the Radcliffe Camera, or Rad Cam, at the University of Oxford in England. Originally a science library, the domed, circular building now serves as a reading room for the Bodleian Library. This 18th-century building is said to be an inspiration for Sauron's temple to Morgoth on Númenor in Tolkien's fiction. Though Tolkien himself didn't study there—he was a student at Exeter College—he would have passed by the Rad Cam countless times during his years as a professor of English Language and Literature at Oxford. This building, with its extraordinary exterior, continues to captivate visitors and Tolkien enthusiasts alike.",

Tucked between the karst hills of Daxin County in China and Trùng Khánh district in Vietnam, these falls tumble along the Quây Sơn River. Over 25 metres tall and 300 metres wide, it holds the distinction of being the widest waterfall in Vietnam. Located just 69 kilometres north of Hanoi, this waterfall has gradually worn away its crest over the years, inching upstream. For most of the year, they flow as two distinct cascades, but come summer, when the rains swell the river, they merge into one big fall.\nEver wondered what 168,000 cubic metres of water rushing over a cliff sound like? Just as Bản Giốc stuns with its beauty, Niagara Falls in Ontario, Canada, captivates with its scale and thundering sound. This side steals the show with the Horseshoe Falls, a massive curtain of water. More than a pretty face, these falls are a powerhouse, literally. Back in 1895, they lit up the world's first major hydroelectric power station, thanks to Nikola Tesla's genius. On calmer days, the mist and rainbow make for perfect photo ops, but come winter, Niagara transforms into a frozen wonderland.",

These calls help them stay connected while foraging or alerting the flock to nearby threats. Breeding starts around February, peaking by April to June. These birds are cavity nesters, often using hollowed-out tree trunks to lay their eggs. Both parents play a role in feeding and protecting the chicks.

This Romanesque church, originally built in 450 CE, features a sturdy square bell tower added in the 9th century, enhancing the basilica's exterior. Its design features three naves, divided by two rows of 12 columns each. Featured in today's image is the basilica's real showstopper: the basement crypt or a burial chamber is a stunning model of early religious design. Complete with vaulted ceilings that slope down into rows of stone columns, its floor is a work of art itself. It's inlaid with beautifully intricate mosaic tiles that have withstood the test of time.\nBuilt on soft marshland, Ravenna faces ongoing structural challenges because the entire city is gradually sinking. This is particularly evident in the crypt, which now remains perpetually submerged under about a foot of water. But instead of battling the slow flood, Ravenna has embraced it, filling the pool with goldfish that glide between the ancient columns and above the submerged mosaics. Visitors here often toss coins into the water, likely wishing for good luck, making this crypt more of a wishing well than a burial site.",

Although rocks are common, few of us take the time to consider how remarkable they are. Forged in volcanoes or moulded by millennia of pressure, these solid masses of minerals hold the key to understanding how our planet formed. Rocks can also contain fossils, the remnants of long-extinct organisms. Canada is home to some jaw-dropping geological wonders. Take Hopewell Rocks in New Brunswick, for example. These giant, flowerpot-like formations were carved by the Bay of Fundy's massive tides, which rise and fall by up to 14 metres daily. Then there's the Mingan Archipelago in Quebec. This collection of limestone monoliths, shaped by waves and wind, is over 450 million years old.\nNow, since we’re talking about rocks, one of the world's most curious displays can be found on Koekohe Beach in New Zealand. The Moeraki Boulders, some of which are 2 metres in diameter, have been shaped by nature over millions of years. Each boulder began as a pebble on the seabed around 65 million years ago. Over time, layers of mud and silt built up around them, cemented together by calcite. Thanks to erosion and the movement of the sea, the boulders eventually emerged. Today, new boulders continue to appear, while the elements gradually break down the existing ones.",

It also boasts some of the tallest sand dunes on Earth, including the famous 'Big Daddy,' which towers roughly 325 metres; Dune 7, the highest dune in Namibia at 383 metres; and Dune 45, which, at roughly 170 metres, is a favourite among photographers.\nAt the heart of this vast, arid expanse is Sossusvlei, seen in today's image. A salt and clay pan surrounded by towering dunes, Sossusvlei tells a story of contrasts. Every 10 years or so, an extraordinary event occurs when the Tsauchab River floods the pan, transforming it into a stunning turquoise lake. Nearby is the eerie Dead Vlei, with its ancient, desiccated camelthorn trees, which remain frozen in time as the extremely dry climate keeps them from decaying.

Created in 1972, Abraham Lake is a man-made reservoir that spans more than 53 square kilometres along the North Saskatchewan River. Thanks to glacier-fed waters from the Rocky Mountains, the lake stays transparent even in the coldest months. The glacial meltwater carries fine sediment that scatters sunlight, while natural filtration through rocks keeps pollutants to a minimum.\nThe snowy season attracts photographers and visitors from around the world who are eager to capture a rare sight at Preacher's Point: the bubbles. These frozen globes form when microorganisms break down dead plants and animals on the lake bed, releasing methane. As the gas rises, it gets trapped by the ice, creating layers of bubbles in various sizes and shapes. It's wild to think that they're flammable and chilling under your feet. The ice is thickest in January and February, making the bubbles clearly visible. If you're planning to check it out, just remember to stick close to the shoreline for your safety.",

Its design was both practical and impressive—thick walls and an innovative cooling system helped maintain the food supply. Twenty-two rows of symmetrical arches divided the space into corridors that used to have vaulted ceilings. Back then, mules climbed onto the roof terrace to deliver grain, which was then dropped through specially designed holes in the ceiling below. The structure housed more than 12,000 horses. Today, it stands as an empty shell, acting as a scenic backdrop ready to be explored. This historical monument is a must-see for anyone curious about how empires were built and fed.",

As part of this tradition, Calennig, meaning 'New Year's gift' in Welsh, plays a central role, linking the celebration to customs from the Julian calendar era. Even after most of the world switched to the Gregorian calendar in 1582, some Welsh communities clung to their old ways. Traditionally, the day involves children going door-to-door, singing songs and offering good wishes in exchange for gifts like coins, food or sweets. A unique feature is its clove-decorated apples. These aren't for snacking, though; they're miniature symbols of luck and prosperity.\nWhile these old traditions have evolved in some parts of Wales, the spirit of Calennig thrives. Cities like Cardiff, the capital of Wales, have transformed the celebration into large-scale events, complete with fireworks, markets and community gatherings. If your New Year's resolutions are already wobbling by January 13, Calennig offers a do-over. So why not embrace a little Welsh magic?

It all began in 1908 when President Theodore Roosevelt designated the area as a national monument. Later in 2013, Pinnacles earned its status as a national park. This land owes its formations to an ancient volcanic eruption that occurred 23 million years ago. The fiery beginnings made towering spires, cliffs and talus caves—created by falling boulders wedged into narrow canyons. Over millennia, tectonic forces shifted the landmass northward, leaving the park far from its volcanic birthplace. Talk about a journey!\nThis place offers a variety of trails, from easy walks to challenging climbs. The High Peaks Trail, featured in today's image, tests your stamina with steep climbs and narrow passages, while Bear Gulch Reservoir provides a more relaxed stroll.

The entire cave complex stretches on for around 4 kilometres, although visitors can only access about 304 metres of the total. Inside, there's a labyrinth of lit pathways winding past stalactite and stalagmite formations, leading to a 118-metre-long saltwater lake.\nNeptune's Grotto is near the town of Alghero on the northwest coast of Sardinia, the second largest island in the Mediterranean. It has been inhabited for at least 10,000 years, but its most important ancient civilisation, the Nuragic peoples, lived there from around 1800 BCE until the 2nd century CE. At this time, villages were built around nuraghes, a kind of round tower fortress. Today, there are still around 7,000 of these nuraghes across the island, and they have become a symbol of Sardinia.

		"description": "Today's image features the brown pelican, a bird that doesn't just fly but soars, spots and dives with unmatched precision. Although it's the smallest of the eight pelican species worldwide, it's still a large bird, measuring about 1.2 metres in length and having a wingspan of 2 metres. It's a marine-dwelling species and can be spotted along the Atlantic coast of the Americas, from New Jersey to the mouth of the Amazon River. On the Pacific coast, it can be spotted from British Columbia all the way to Peru, including a stop at the Galapagos Islands.\nThe brown pelican is a piscivore, meaning its diet mainly consists of fish. Dixon Lanier Merritt's limerick famously begins, 'A wonderful bird is the pelican; his bill can hold more than his belly can,' and it's spot on—its pouch can store up to three times the volume of its stomach. This versatile feature acts as a scoop, a tool for cooling off during hot weather and a feeding trough for young pelicans. In addition to the brown pelican, one can easily spot the American white pelican flying in Canadian skies. It is one of the largest birds in North America and is found from the interior of British Columbia, east to northwestern Ontario.",

These little rodents are found across most of the globe, and today is their special day: Squirrel Appreciation Day. This unofficial holiday was started by a North Carolina wildlife rehabilitator to encourage people to leave out seeds and nuts for these critters. From the tiny least pygmy squirrel—just 14 centimetres long—to the Bhutan giant flying squirrel at more than 122 centimetres, these mammals come in all shapes and sizes.\nToday's image features a Eurasian red squirrel, photographed in the Netherlands. The red squirrel can be found across Europe and Russia, from western Spain and Portugal all the way to eastern Siberia. Their diet mainly consists of nuts, fungi, seeds and berries, but they will occasionally eat birds' eggs. In addition to being the national mammal of Denmark, they also play a part in old Norse mythology. Ratatoskr is a red squirrel who scurries up and down Yggdrasil, the sacred tree, carrying messages and spreading gossip. So, next time you spot a red squirrel, it could just be a furry little messenger!",

Tucked in the heart of Jordan's arid desert landscapes, this ancient city once thrived as the capital of the Nabataean Kingdom in the 2nd century BCE. It was also a hub of the spice trade, connecting distant regions like China, Egypt, Greece and India. The city was abandoned for around 500 years before being rediscovered in 1812, earning it the 'Lost City' moniker.\nAd-Deir, seen in today's image, dates to the 1st century CE. Its design is characterised by a combination of Hellenistic and Mesopotamian influences. Although the exact purpose of the structure is debated, it's believed to have been used as a church during the Byzantine period. Standing nearly 45 metres tall and 48 metres wide, its massive facade is carved directly into the sandstone cliffs, showcasing the Nabataeans' ingenious craftsmanship and architecture. The journey to this landmark involves a steep hike up 800 stone steps, winding through rocky terrain.

		"description": "What could be better than warming up winter with a feast that's a little wild and a lot of fun? Thorrablot, Iceland's midwinter festival, invites you to dive headfirst into tradition. This celebration of survival, culture and community, which dates to the Viking Age, was once a way for Icelanders to honour Thor, the Norse god of thunder. Today, people celebrate by gathering to feast on an array of local delicacies, including fermented shark, smoked lamb, rye bread and shots of Brennivín—often called 'black death' schnapps.\nStrokkur geyser—featured in the image—warms up winter in a completely different way. Located in the geothermal area beside the Hvítá River, this geyser erupts every 6 to 10 minutes, shooting hot water 15–20 metres into the air. It has been consistently active since 1963. There is science behind its eruption—magma beneath the Earth's crust heats groundwater until the pressure builds up, forcing the water explosively to the surface. Both Thorrablot and Strokkur celebrate Iceland's resilience—one through its people and the other through its land.",

With its smooth grey bark, short trunk and sweeping branches, this tree is a standout in Belgium's forests, as shown in today's image. It grows in temperate regions and prefers well-drained, fertile soils, taking up to 30 years to mature. Not only do these 50-metre tall trees dominate the landscape, but their wood is also used to make some of the sturdiest furniture, flooring and even kitchen tools. Wildlife such as black bears, foxes, squirrels, chipmunks and mice love them too—beech nuts, though slightly bitter, provide a feast for all kinds of critters. In winter, the beech forests in Belgium become even more enchanting.\nIn Canada, the American beech is a fascinating part of the country's natural heritage. These deciduous trees are native to eastern Canada, thriving in regions like Ontario, Quebec and parts of the Maritimes. Historically, these trees were highly valued by Indigenous communities. The tree's durable wood was used for tools and floor planks, while the nuts were sometimes collected as a food source. They are also slow-growing but resilient and can live over 300 years.",

It's home to some stunning geographic features, like Zoroaster Temple, featured in today's image. This towering 2,100-metre summit is in Coconino County. The peak was named after the ancient Iranian prophet Zoroaster by George Wharton James, an American photographer and journalist and Clarence Dutton, an American geologist.

		"description": "The short-eared owl, featured in today's image, is a grassland-dwelling member of the owl family. Found on all continents except Antarctica and Australia, it is one of the most widely distributed bird species. This winged bird is found across Canada, primarily in open habitats such as grasslands, prairies and wetlands. This raptor belongs to the genus Asio, whose members are characterised by feather tufts ('ears') on their heads. The short-eared owl only reveals its tufts when feeling defensive. Because of its irregular wingbeats, its flight is on the floppy side, much like a moth or bat. It likes to glide a few metres above the ground in open fields and grasslands, swooping down feet-first to grab its prey\nOwls primarily hunt at night, but this silent hunter is also active during the day and at dusk. Its daylight hunts often coincide with the peak activity of small rodents called voles—its favourite meal. Known to relocate to areas with higher rodent populations, the short-eared owl even wanders nomadically in search of better food supplies during years when vole populations are low. In the breeding season, it is commonly found in the prairie provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, as well as in parts of Ontario and Quebec. During migration, it can be spotted across much of southern Canada. In winter, short-eared owls may move south to more temperate regions, but they are also known to remain in some areas of southern Canada if food and suitable habitat are available.",

Though it is celebrated mostly in Ontario, other places like Nova Scotia and Quebec also take part in the fun. The tradition has deep roots, first appearing in the early 1800s when European settlers brought similar customs to North America. Historically, Europeans celebrated today as the first day of spring, and Germans originally watched badgers and other small animals for signs of seasonal change important to farmers.\nThe alpine marmot in today's image is a close relative of the groundhog, which is another species of marmot.

The town is home to the Svans, a cultural and linguistic subgroup of Georgians. Despite its modest size, Mestia has been an essential hub of Georgian culture for centuries, dotted with the Svan defensive towers, seen in today's image. Most of these towers were constructed between the 9th and 12th centuries, a period often referred to as Georgia's Golden Age. However, their roots are believed to stretch even further back, possibly into prehistoric times. Built for both protection and shelter, these towers were not just fortresses but also integral parts of family homes, reflecting the region's history of resilience and self-sufficiency. Therefore, it isn't just a town; it's a living museum where history rises from these towers and echoes through the mountains.",

Carved into sandstone cliffs over 1,500 years ago during the Northern Wei dynasty (386–534/535 CE), the grottoes contain 254 caves. The highlight is the massive Buddha in Cave 5, which is a jaw-dropping 18 metres tall. But don't stop there—each cave offers something unique. Some are like ancient storyboards, depicting tales from Buddhist scriptures, while others showcase detailed carvings of monks, deities, musicians and even scenes of daily life under Wei rule.\nCaves 16–20, known as the 'Tanyao Five Caves,' were the first to be carved at Yungang, overseen by the monk Tanyao. While you're there, be sure to explore Cave 20's seated Buddha idol in a meditation posture, with a standing attendant Buddha on one side. What's fascinating is that these caves blend influences from Indian, Central Asian and local Chinese Buddhist art.

As an English naturalist, geologist and biologist, his theory of natural selection revolutionised our understanding of species, evolution and our role in the natural world. His work, 'On the Origin of Species,' published in 1859, laid the foundation for modern evolutionary biology. This day marks the birthday of Darwin and honours his genius while promoting curiosity, science and critical thinking. From thought-provoking talks to engaging exhibits, this day motivates us to keep exploring.\nSpeaking of cool science, marine iguanas, found only on the Galápagos Islands, serve as an example of Darwin's evolutionary principles. These reptiles, seen in today's image, are the only lizards in the world that forage in the sea, diving to graze on algae growing on submerged rocks. They've adapted in remarkable ways, from flattened tails for swimming to salt glands that allow them to expel seawater by sneezing. During his visit to the islands in 1835, Darwin noted their appearance as being like 'imps of darkness' but also recognised how perfectly they were adapted to their harsh environment.",

Over time, climate changes caused water levels to drop; these days, the lake is normally dry, except in winter when it's covered in around 5 centimetres of water. The name 'Tyrrell' comes from the local Wergaia word for 'sky,' a nod to the Boorong Aboriginal People's interest in astronomy. Spanning more than 18,180 square kilometres, Lake Tyrrell is a haven for wildlife, including Mallee reptiles, kangaroos and emus.\nIn recent years, the lake has become a tourist hotspot. People come from all over the world during the winter months, drawn by its mirror-like surface that reflects the endless Australian sky, making it the perfect photo op. The salt formations on the lakebed also provide a stunning backdrop for photographs.

Yet, thanks to conservation efforts, their populations are rebounding in many regions across Europe.\nOtters are naturally playful, often sliding down snowy or muddy banks and diving underwater to find pebbles to play with.

Polar bears are native to the Arctic and can be found in Alaska, Russia, Greenland and Svalbard. They're also found in Canada—like the cub in today's image, photographed in Churchill, Manitoba.\nPolar bears spend over half of their time hunting for seals on the sea ice, although they usually catch just one or two for every 10 that they try to catch. Their reliance on sea ice for hunting means that they are highly vulnerable to climate change. Sea ice is rapidly disappearing as the planet heats up, and polar bears are at risk of malnutrition and starvation as their hunting grounds vanish. Shrinking ice sheets also mean that these bears have to swim farther to find food, which depletes their energy reserves.

		"description": "Nature's desert navigators—desert bighorn sheep—are a marvel to watch, effortlessly scaling cliffs and navigating rocky terrains with grace. Native to North America, these sheep are known for their distinctive curled horns, which can weigh up to 14 kilograms. Rams use their massive horns in intense head-butting contests. During these battles, males hurl themselves at each other in charges of up to 32 kilometres per hour. Ewes, on the other hand, tend to keep things more low-key, forming smaller groups with their lambs. Adapted to the desert environment, bighorn sheep can go long periods without water, relying on moisture from plants to survive. In Canada, they inhabit the Rocky Mountains, including parts of British Columbia, Alberta and Yukon.\nValley of Fire State Park seen in today's image, is one of the best spots in Nevada, United States, to observe these desert dwellers. This park is named for its fiery red sandstone formations that seem to glow under the sun. Beyond its natural beauty, the park holds deep historical significance, with petroglyphs left by ancient Indigenous peoples. It has also earned a place in pop culture as a filming location for scenes from 'Star Trek Generations.' Keep an eye on the rocky outcrops during your visit—you might spot a bighorn sheep observing you.",

		"description": "Some places feel almost untouched by time. In Canada, one such place sits deep in Jasper National Park, Alberta, where the 22-kilometre-long, winding Maligne Lake cuts through the mountains. It is the largest natural lake in the Canadian Rockies, where towering peaks, glacial waters and endless sky come together.\nEarly Indigenous communities, including the Dane-zaa, Nakoda and Cree, have long used the area surrounding the lake for hunting and travel, and their connection to the land continues to this day. In 1907, guide Mary Schäffer mapped the lake, bringing it to wider attention. Spirit Island, a small tree-covered island in the lake, became a well-known landmark after photographers captured its striking reflection in the water. Now, it's a favourite for paddlers, hikers and those chasing the northern lights. The best time to catch the auroras? Fall through spring, when the nights are longer and geomagnetic activity is strong. When conditions line up, the aurora borealis sweeps across the sky in shades of greens, pinks and purples, as seen in today's image. It occurs when solar particles hit the Earth's magnetic field, creating light that flickers across the atmosphere. A clear sky and a bit of patience can turn an ordinary night into something unforgettable.",

This year's theme is 'Wildlife Conservation Finance: Investing in People and Planet.' The events emphasise exchanging ideas, presenting solutions and diving into how innovative finance can help stop biodiversity loss and create a more sustainable future. Schools, conservation groups and wildlife parks host events such as nature walks, workshops, art contests, wildlife photography competitions and conservation talks to raise awareness.\nOne species worth learning about is the southern yellow-billed hornbill, pictured here, a bird found throughout Southern Africa and commonly spotted in Kruger National Park in South Africa. Recognisable by its bright yellow, curved bill, this bird is often seen hopping on the ground in search of food. Its diet includes insects, seeds, fruits, berries, nuts and small reptiles, making it a key player in the ecosystem as both a predator and seed disperser. Social creatures, these hornbills are usually found in pairs or small groups, often foraging together. Their calls—whistling, grunting and cackling—echo across the savannah.",

Rooted in ancient Roman celebrations like Saturnalia, Mardi Gras evolved as Christianity spread, blending local customs—most notably Carnival festivities—with religious observances.\nNew Orleans is synonymous with Mardi Gras, a tradition celebrated with parades, music and revelry since 1699. Jackson Square in the French Quarter, featured in today's image, stands as a witness to these lively events. Built in the early 1800s, it remains a central spot for visitors to experience the energy of Mardi Gras.\nWhile the warm, bustling parades of New Orleans steal the spotlight, Canada has its own take on Mardi Gras, especially in Quebec. The Quebec City Carnival, held annually from late January to mid-February since 1894, is the largest winter festival in the Western Hemisphere. Snow sculptures, ice canoe races and brightly lit parades are the scene, with participants dressed in bold costumes, making it a true feast for the eyes. Montreal, Ottawa and even smaller cities embrace the festive spirit with lively parties, dance events and family-friendly activities.",

Over time, the lake transformed the landscape into something you'd think was straight out of a movie, as featured in today's image. The dam, originally known as the 'Cheow Lan Project,' was later renamed Rajjaprabha, meaning 'light of the kingdom,' a tribute to King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who ruled from 1946 to 2016.

First observed in the early 1900s, the day traces its roots to labour movements led by women fighting for better pay, improved working conditions and voting rights. From its humble beginnings in 1911, when over a million people attended rallies in Europe, the day has grown into a worldwide movement. Today, it's marked by events, protests and campaigns addressing issues like gender pay gaps, domestic violence and access to education.

Daylight saving time (DST) starts today at 2 AM, reminding us that time, quite literally, waits for no one. The idea is simple: maximising daylight and reducing energy consumption by syncing our activities with the natural light cycle. This concept was popularised by Benjamin Franklin in the 18th century, though his suggestion to 'save candles' was more satirical than a serious proposal. Fast forward to the early 20th century, and many countries adopted DST to conserve fuel during wartime. Today, DST runs from March to November in around 70 countries, giving us eight months of extended evening light.\nThe clock in today's image—St. Mark's Clock Tower—is in Venice, Italy, where it has been keeping time for over 500 years.

Introduced in 1999 by William Anthony, a Boston University professor, and his wife, Camille, this unofficial holiday encourages everyone to take quality naps. Observed on the Monday after clocks spring forward, it's a reminder that rest is essential for well-being. Research backs it up—short naps boost mood, enhance concentration and sharpen memory. Napping is also linked to lower stress and better heart health. While power naps (20-30 minutes) are ideal for a quick recharge, even a few minutes of shut-eye can help.\nIn Uganda's Queen Elizabeth National Park, some lions take napping to new heights—quite literally. The tree-climbing lions of the Ishasha Sector have a habit of sprawling across the branches of giant fig trees, as seen in today's image.

Over time, it evolved into a residence for nobility, most notably serving as the home of Maximilien de Béthune, Duke of Sully, who was a trusted minister of King Henry IV. The castle played a significant role during the French Wars of Religion from 1562 to 1598 and has witnessed countless moments of intrigue and diplomacy. In 1940, during World War II, the castle wall was hit by shells, creating massive holes, but the framework remained intact.\nToday, after multiple restorations, the castle welcomes visitors eager to uncover its history. It also stands as an example of French Renaissance architecture. Visitors can explore the imposing towers, thick stone walls and the beautiful moat that once protected the castle from invaders. The restored interiors feature authentic furniture and artefacts, offering a window into medieval life. Guided tours provide insights into the castle's role in shaping regional and national history.

This date was chosen because 3, 1 and 4 are the first three significant figures of pi (π) when it is written out. Pi is an irrational number, which means that it can't be written as a fraction. When written out, its decimal representation goes on infinitely without repeating. The oldest attempts to calculate pi date back to ancient Babylon and Egypt, around 1,900 BCE.\nPi Day, however, has more recent origins. In the 1980s, physicist Larry Shaw organised the first celebration, where staff at a San Francisco science museum walked around in circles and then ate the number's delicious homophones: pies. Today's image takes us to Álava, northern Spain. The circular motion of the stars appears above the Dolmen of Sorginetxe, an ancient megalithic monument dating back to 3,000 BCE.

		"description": "In the world of clever hunting, the black heron rules the roost. This bird thrives in shallow, open waters and at the edges of freshwater lakes and ponds. It's also commonly spotted in marshes, rice fields, seasonally flooded grasslands and along riverbanks. At first glance, this feathered genius seems like any other wading bird, with its long legs, slender neck and pointed beak that aid in hunting. But when it hunts, this jet-black African species showcases an extraordinary skill—it takes the shape of an umbrella, as seen in today's image. While fishing, the heron dips its head, extends its wings around its body and forms a shaded canopy.\nThis clever technique is known as canopy feeding. One common theory is that small fish, seeking cover, are attracted to the shade of the heron's wings and swim right into its trap. The shade acts like polarised sunglasses, reducing glare and improving the heron's vision under the water. Additionally, the heron might also be camouflaging itself, which further intensifies the trap for the fish.",

		"description": "With the sun rising higher, the days grow longer, marking the arrival of spring. The spring equinox occurs when the sun crosses the celestial equator, moving from the Southern Hemisphere to the Northern Hemisphere. Traditionally, spring is considered to begin on March 21. However, astronomers and calendar makers now agree that spring officially commences on March 20 across all time zones in North America. This event signals the true start of the season, bringing with it the beauty and symbolism of spring blooms.\nAmong these blooms, narcissus, commonly known as daffodil or jonquil—featured here—stands out as a quintessential symbol of the season. Celebrated for centuries in art and literature, the daffodil carries cultural significance worldwide, symbolising death, renewal and good fortune. As one of England's most cherished plants, the daffodil has been celebrated by many English writers for its cultural and symbolic significance, making it one of the most poetically revered flowers. From John Gower and Shakespeare to William Wordsworth and John Milton, daffodils have inspired countless verses in literary history.",

With over 4,000 known species worldwide, they come in all shapes and sizes, from the tiny New Guinea Amau frog—smaller than a dime—to the large Goliath frog, which can weigh more than 3 kilograms. Some, like the glass frog, are nearly transparent, while others are extremely poisonous. The golden poison frog, for example, carries enough toxin to take down ten humans. And if you think all frogs are swamp-dwellers, meet the desert rain frog, a round little amphibian that survives in dry conditions by absorbing moisture through its skin.\nThis month is the perfect excuse to give them the credit they deserve. Frogs play a crucial role in ecosystems by controlling insect populations and serving as prey for many predators. However, habitat loss, pollution and disease threaten many species. Although the origin of National Frog Month is unclear, conservation groups, educators and zoos have embraced the month to emphasise the need to protect frog populations.

		"description": "Spring has arrived, but Whistler isn't ready to let go of winter just yet! As the snow-capped Whistler and Blackcomb mountains keep their frosty charm, the annual Whistler World Ski & Snowboard Festival (WSSF) takes centre stage. Packed with jaw-dropping ski stunts, exhilarating snowboard competitions and back-to-back entertainment, the festival is a final hurrah for winter sports before the season melts away.\nThis multi-day celebration began in 1996, originally created to extend the winter season and boost tourism. Kicking off today and running until April 13 this year, the festival draws a global crowd of athletes, artists and revellers. A new addition this year is the grand finale of 'The Grind,' a street-style ski and board competition. Competitions like the classic Whistler race and Slush Cup keep adrenaline high, while photography exhibits and art displays offer a creative touch. After sunset, the town comes alive with concerts like the 'Battle of the Bands,' film screenings, cultural events and après-ski parties.",

		"description": "Tucked along the Algarve coast in Portugal is the Benagil Cave, carved by the relentless power of the sea. Called Algar de Benagil in Portuguese, this sea cave, seen in today's image, draws adventurers, photographers and nature enthusiasts from across the world. With its limestone walls, circular skylight and turquoise waters, its inside looks like a natural cathedral.\nBenagil Cave wasn't sculpted overnight—it was formed over millions of years by coastal erosion, shaped mostly by waves, currents and tides. The cave's most distinctive feature is its 'eye,' a natural opening in the ceiling that bathes the interior in sunlight, creating a stunning interplay of light and shadow. The cave is located near Benagil, a quaint Portuguese village on the Atlantic coast in the municipality of Lagoa. Until the late 20th century, Benagil was a traditional fishing village, with its economy deeply rooted in ocean fishing. Over the years, it has transformed into a thriving tourist destination, thanks in part to its stunning beach, Praia de Benagil. The region, including the Benagil Cave, showcases a perfect harmony of nature's wonders and the charm of Portugal's coastline.",

When the sun is positioned well below the horizon, during this brief window, the lingering sunlight casts a deep blue hue across the sky.\nNaxos is renowned for its deposits of emery, a corundum-rich rock that was once among the finest natural abrasives used before modern alternatives emerged. The most fertile island in the Cyclades, it has a reliable water supply in the region. It is celebrated across Greece for its signature flavours, including the rich Arseniko Naxou cheese, flavourful potatoes, aromatic Kitron liqueur made from local citrus and Naxian honey, primarily sourced from thyme nectar. A sun-soaked island, Naxos is packed with beaches, villages and ancient ruins. Whether you're looking to rest on the sands of beaches like Agia Anna, Agios Prokopios or Plaka or chase the wind at one of the island's top windsurfing and kitesurfing spots, there's no shortage of adventure here.",

		"description": "April 10 rolls around, and suddenly, childhood rivalries, inside jokes and borrowed clothes come flooding back. Siblings Day is here—a day to appreciate the ones who stole your toys, tattled on you and yet somehow remain your biggest supporters. Although Siblings Day is not a federally recognised holiday, it has gained recognition across several countries. The idea came from Claudia Evart, who established the day in memory of her late siblings. Since 1995, the Siblings Day Foundation has worked to celebrate this occasion and the unique connection shared by brothers and sisters.\nSiblinghood isn't just for humans—it's a big deal in the wild too! Red fox cubs, featured in today's image, take sibling rivalry and teamwork to a whole new level. Cubs are born in an underground den, blind and helpless. Their mother keeps them safe while the father brings food. But as their eyes open and legs strengthen, the real fun begins. Sibling play is essential, shaping their hunting and social skills while keeping things entertaining. Wrestling, pouncing and even playful ambushes are all part of the training. They mimic each other's behaviours, test their boundaries and develop their cunning instincts as a team. So, this Siblings Day, take a lesson from these animals—embrace the chaos, enjoy the fun and maybe let your sibling have the last snack—just this once.",

		"description": "From the famous tulip fields to the world's largest flower auction, the Netherlands and tulips go a long way back. Interestingly, tulips didn't originate here. These beauties arrived in the country in the late 16th century, brought from the Ottoman Empire. By the 17th century, they became so valuable that a single bulb could cost more than a house. This period, known as 'tulip mania,' is considered one of the first recorded financial bubbles. When prices crashed in 1637, fortunes were lost, but the love for tulips remained.\nThe most famous tulip fields, like the one pictured here, are found in regions such as the Bollenstreek (Bulb Region), just outside Amsterdam. Rows of red, yellow, pink and purple stretch as far as the eye can see. Then there's Keukenhof, in Lisse, the world's most famous flower park, open only for a few weeks each spring. It showcases over seven million bulbs, including rare and exotic tulip varieties. The designs change every year, so no two visits are ever the same. If you miss the bloom, don't worry—the Netherlands keeps its tulip industry thriving year-round. The Dutch take their tulips seriously, and nowhere is this more evident than at the Aalsmeer Flower Auction, the largest flower market in the world. Here, millions of flowers, including tulips, are bought and sold daily, making their way to homes across the globe.",

		"description": "Not so long ago, humanity took its first step beyond Earth. For thousands of years, we gazed at the stars, dreaming of what lay beyond. Then, on April 12, 1961, one man left the planet and changed history forever. That morning, Soviet pilot Yuri Gagarin climbed into a small, spherical spacecraft named Vostok 1. The countdown began. The engines ignited. As the rocket roared toward the sky, he called out, 'Poyekhali!'—'Let's go!' And just like that, Earth had its first space traveller.\nFor 108 minutes, Gagarin orbited the planet, watching the world from a view no human had ever seen before. When he landed safely back on Earth, everything had changed. Humanity had entered the Space Age. His flight sparked the race to the Moon, the dream of living on Mars and much more. Decades later, in honour of his achievement, the United Nations declared April 12 as the International Day of Human Space Flight. Pictured here is the view from the cupola of the International Space Station, showing the vast South Pacific Ocean. It is a reminder of how small Earth is in the grand cosmos—and how far human spaceflight has taken us.",

		"description": "New Year celebrations don't always come with fireworks—sometimes, they come with buckets and a nationwide water splash fest! Thailand's Songkran festival is a unique mix of spiritual traditions and all-out water fights. Held from April 13 to 15 this year, the holiday is deeply rooted in Buddhist customs and focuses on cleansing and starting afresh. During this time, people visit temples, offer food to monks and pour scented water over Buddha statues and elders' hands as a sign of respect. Meanwhile, the streets turn into water battlegrounds, with locals and tourists alike getting soaked in the spirit of renewal. Traditional parades roll through the lanes, and in some places, the 'Lady Songkran' or 'Miss Songkran' contest steals the show, with contestants dressed in stunning Thai outfits.\nThose seeking a calmer way to celebrate might consider visiting Wat Tang Sai Temple in Ban Krut, seen in today's image. Perched on Thong Chai Mountain, this temple complex is home to a 13-metre-tall Buddha statue and Thai-style pagodas. Built in 1996 to honour King Bhumibol Adulyadej (Rama IX) on his 50th year of reign (1946–2016), it remains an important spiritual site. With stunning coastline views, Wat Tang Sai offers a peaceful setting to meditate and feel the vibrations of Buddhist chants.",

Found mainly in warm, temperate waters of the Atlantic Ocean, these dolphins are known for their unique spotted patterns, which become more visible as they age.\nJuveniles start with a plain grey body, but as they mature, spots cover their skin, making each dolphin's pattern entirely unique. From leaping through waves to chatting in clicks and whistles, dolphins are all about social life. They often travel in pods and love to check out passing boats whenever they get the chance. You'll find them in the warm temperate and tropical waters of the Atlantic, hunting fish in coordinated groups. Santa Maria Island, part of Portugal's Azores archipelago, is a popular spot to witness these dolphins in action. Their speed and agility make them efficient hunters—and a thrill to watch. So, the next time you see a speckled dolphin, know it's probably living its best ocean life!",

Shaped by the relentless forces of wind and water, this monument features three magnificent natural bridges—Sipapu, Kachina and Owachomo. These bridges were named to honour the Ancestral Puebloans who once lived here. Sipapu is the largest bridge, with a massive opening that could almost fit the dome of the United States Capitol. Kachina, pictured here, is equidistant from Sipapu and Owachomo. It was named after the petroglyphs and pictographs found at its base. Owachomo is believed to be the oldest of the three. Its thin, arching structure suggests it may eventually collapse. Today, this monument remains a place of awe and solitude, where visitors can hike beneath the soaring bridges, gaze at some of the darkest night skies in the country and step back into a landscape sculpted over millions of years.",

		"description": "If fashion had a bird ambassador, the cock-of-the-rock would steal the spotlight. The males? They look like they're wearing a bright orange-red costume, complete with a huge crest that almost covers their beak. With its bold colours, this native South American bird isn't just about looks—it's got the moves too.\nThe Andean and Guianan cock-of-the-rock are renowned for their theatrical courtship dances, making them true head-turners of the feathered kingdom. Females are far less flashy, with brownish feathers that help them stay hidden. During the mating season, males gather in leks—noisy display arenas—where they hop, squawk and shake their heads in an effort to impress a female. She watches, picks the best dancer, mates and then flies off to build a concave, cup-shaped mud nest on a rocky surface. The female typically lays two white eggs and incubates them for 25 to 28 days, raising the chicks on her own. The Andean cock-of-the-rock thrives in the cloud forests of the Andes, favouring dense, fruit-rich areas in Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia. As a frugivore, it primarily eats fruit and helps spread seeds throughout its habitat. It occasionally consumes insects and small vertebrates.",

It became a national park in 1919, but its history stretches much further back. The Ancestral Puebloans and later the Southern Paiute people lived here, relying on the Virgin River. Evidence of their presence remains in petroglyphs and archaeological sites. Today, the river continues to carve through the landscape, creating canyons that attract hikers and climbers.\nThe park's highest point, Horse Ranch Mountain, stands at 2,660 metres, while the lowest, Coalpits Wash, sits at 1,117 metres. Trails lead visitors from riverbanks to ridgelines. Angels Landing is one of Zion's famous hikes, offering a steep climb and breathtaking views. Observation Point, a longer but less exposed trek, sits even higher, overlooking Zion Canyon. For those who prefer a more relaxed route, the Emerald Pools Trail offers waterfalls, lush vegetation and shaded pathways. This national park has a diverse plant and animal life. It is home to 289 bird, 79 mammal, 28 reptile, 7 fish and 6 amphibian species. Flora ranges from towering ponderosa pines to delicate hanging gardens clinging to the canyon walls. Zion doesn't just impress—it leaves a lasting mark.",
