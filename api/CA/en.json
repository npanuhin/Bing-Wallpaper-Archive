		"description": "Put on your tartan and let the bagpipes play—it's St. Andrew's Day! Scotland's national day is a public holiday there—though not everyone takes the day off. A fisherman by trade, St. Andrew was one of Jesus' apostles and a key figure in Christianity. Though he never set foot in Scotland, his influence is immortalised in the country's Saltire flag, which is said to represent the cross on which he was martyred.\nBrought over by Scottish immigrants in Canada, this day reflects the connection between Scotland and Canada. The North British Society of Halifax, Nova Scotia (now known as the Scots Society), was the first group in what would become Canada to celebrate St. Andrew in 1768. Today, the occasion is marked by parades, concerts, storytelling sessions and cultural festivals in communities with strong Scottish ties, such as Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia. Food plays a central role in celebrations, too. Expect hearty servings of Scottish staples like haggis, neeps and tatties (mashed rutabaga and potatoes). To mark this day, we're visiting Kilchurn Castle, one of Scotland's historic landmarks, in the west of the country. Perched on the banks of Loch Awe, the fortress was built in the mid-15th century by Sir Colin Campbell.",

		"description": "New Year's Eve, also known as Old Year's Day, is celebrated around the world with revelry, fireworks and, for some, religious and cultural observances. Many countries celebrate with foods symbolic of prosperity, long life and good fortune for the coming year. At the stroke of midnight, many people sing the Scottish folk song 'Auld Lang Syne' to remember old friends and past experiences. The new year is often personified as a baby, a tradition dating back to the ancient Greeks, and is frequently paired with an old man representing the previous year.\nHave you ever seen Parliament Hill in Ottawa, sparkle brighter than your resolutions? Parliament Hill, a central symbol of Canada's government, transforms into a vibrant spot to ring in the new year. The fireworks display is the highlight of the evening, lighting up the Ottawa River, as seen in today's image. Beyond the dazzling pyrotechnics, there's often music and entertainment that reflects the city's character. The fireworks light up the sky at midnight, drawing both locals and visitors together to celebrate in a shared moment of awe.",

In the past, Europeans would often use the smooth bark of beech trees for writing texts. In fact, in the modern Dutch language, the term for 'book' directly translates as 'beech tree.' As the sun shines through the forest canopy, wild anemones brighten up the woodland with their white petals. These blooms, representing delicate beauty and sincerity, have even starred in masterpieces by artists such as Monet and Vincent van Gogh.",

The area that spreads across 511 square kilometres was recognised as a national park in 1970. The Nuu-chah-nulth First Nations of the region have walked these lands for centuries. Today, seven of the 15 Nuu-chah-nulth tribes have at least 22 small reserves within the park and nine bordering it. Another notable feature of the reserve is the Coastal Western Hemlock Biogeoclimatic Zone. This temperate forest terrain is home to several animal species such as black bears, Vancouver Island cougars and martens.\nThe Broken Group Islands, seen in today's image, are a collection of small islands and islets scattered across Barkley Sound.

They were hunted for their fur, and their 'nuisance' freshwater abodes were destroyed. However, these buck-toothed, paddle-tailed dam builders have been gaining new respect in recent years. These animals have beneficial effects not only on water quality but also on land. With their iron-coated orange incisors, beavers fell trees, diligently constructing not just homes but habitats. Their dams create life-sustaining wetlands for countless species. Meanwhile, their lodges are masterpieces of security and comfort, the entrance strategically submerged to deter predators and provide privacy. The rodents have no trouble getting in, as they can hold their breath for up to 15 minutes. So, 'woodn't' it be nice to give a shout-out to these creatures on International Beaver Day?",

These sandstone balls—a phenomenon known as concretions—formed over millions of years as sedimentary layers built up around a central core of sand and stone held together by mineral cement. Erosion gradually wore away the outer layers to expose the spherical shapes we see today. This created a fascinating spectacle that only appears at low tide. Concretions are rare, and there has been plenty of wild speculation about where they come from, with some believing them to be extraterrestrial debris while others wondering if they are dinosaur fossils.

Lying on a narrow strip of land between two lochs, the site initially comprised 60 stones, although today only 36 remain. The exact purpose of the structure is still unknown; in 2008, an excavation project called the Ring of Brodgar Excavation was undertaken to try to learn more about the site, but the project has not yet reached any conclusive results.

Established in 1934, the park encompasses over 2,114 square kilometres of wilderness. The forests, which cover most of the park, are home to 1,500 species of flowering plants, 952 algae, 65 species of mammals and over 240 species of birds, making it an International Biosphere Reserve.\nCades Cove—seen in today's photo—is a valley within the Great Smoky Mountains National Park renowned for its stunning scenery and historic structures, including log cabins, barns and churches. While exploring the park, you can also visit historical areas like Roaring Fork, Cataloochee and Elkmont. If you wish to watch fireflies, then Elkmont is the place for you and if you are a geologist, there's something for you too: this park is home to late Precambrian rocks. So, set your spirit of adventure free and explore the timeless treasure: national parks!",

		"description": "Today is Earth Day—a day dedicated to celebrating the planet we call home and raising awareness of environmental problems. The seeds of this day were planted back in 1969 when Gaylord Nelson, the then-Wisconsin senator, witnessed events like the Cuyahoga River catching fire and the Santa Barbara oil spill and decided that the world needed an environmental initiative. A year later, the first Earth Day event was held. Now, it has grown into an annual event with more than a billion people in over 193 countries taking part.\nThis year, the campaign's focus is on plastics, which are a particularly serious form of pollution on land and in the oceans. Many species—including this green sea turtle—eat the plastic waste they find in the ocean, mistaking it for food. These same plastics pose an entanglement risk and can also break down to become microplastics. Every year some 25 million tonnes of plastic enter aquatic ecosystems. So, whether you're planting trees, cleaning up beaches or simply spreading the word, let's remember to promote sustainable living. After all, there's no planet B!",

Despite their small size, Adélie penguins are sleek swimmers and can dive as deep as 175 metres in search of shrimp-like krill or fish. They are social animals which gather in small colonies for foraging, hunting and protection.

It came about thanks to the efforts of Anna Jarvis, daughter of Ann Jarvis, a social activist. Jarvis was the one who organised the first Mother's Day service of worship and celebration. On this day, people express gratitude towards their mothers by giving gifts and cards, baking cakes and posting on social media. Well, how about writing a letter to your mother?",

The longest river in the country—the Fish River—has carved out the continent's largest canyon over millions of years. Winding through weathered layers of gneiss and dolomite rocks, the Fish River Canyon is around 160 kilometres long and about 548 metres deep. This popular site attracts adventure seekers with its hiking trail, which runs for 90 kilometres and the Fish River Canyon Ultra Marathon. Moreover, with Hartmann's mountain zebras, klipspringers and Eastern rock elephant shrews, the canyon is teeming with creatures big and small. So, whether you are there for hiking, trekking, camping or just soaking in the scenery, one thing's for sure: Fish River Canyon is a catch you won't soon forget.",

They can beat their wings over 40-50 times per second, enabling them to hover and even fly backwards with ease.\nDuring their courtship, the males exhibit a remarkable performance. They embark on dives, making squeaky sounds to impress their mates. They fly skyward up to 40 metres before plummeting at a breakneck speed of roughly 3 kilometres per hour, emitting a sonic 'whoosh' with their tail feathers. During breeding season, the female builds a round nest of 3-5 centimetres in diameter, where she raises her young alone. So, the next time you're outside, keep an eye—and ear—out for Anna's hummingbird.",

Once you learn to ride, you'll never forget how to wheel around. Thanks to Polish-American scientist Leszek Sibiliski's initiative, the United Nations declared June 3 World Bicycle Day in 2018.\nKarl von Drais, a German inventor, is credited with developing the first two-wheeler, the 'swiftwalker,' in 1817. The machine certainly needed some further thinking, since the wooden frame and wheels didn't have pedals. The modern versions of bikes were developed in the late 1800s, but the materials used for them are still constantly evolving to make the ride easier and more secure. So, hop on a bike to find your crew on Word Bicycle Day!",

The day was June 6, 1944, a date forever etched in time as D-Day. It marked the launch of Operation Overlord, the ambitious Allied invasion that became a turning point in World War II.

One such symbol is Les Braves, a sculpture gracing Omaha Beach. French artist Anilore Banon's design features three sections called 'Wings of Hope', 'Rise, Freedom!' and 'Wings of Fraternity'.

The Registan Square is encircled by three Islamic schools, namely the Ulugh Beg Madrasah, the Sher-Dor Madrasah and the Tilya-Kori Madrasah, characterised by the Islamic architectural style, which typically features elaborate repetitive patterns and ornamental forms.

This megacity on the Ganges Delta, home to over 10.2 million people, is one of the most densely populated cities on the planet. Once known as Jahangirnagar after ruling emperor Jahangir, Dhaka was the provincial capital of the Mughal Empire for 75 years in total. Dhaka has been nicknamed 'City of Mosques' because of the hundreds of elegant minarets that dot the city.\nHere, the cheers from football and cricket stadiums fill the air, and rickshaws, painted with colourful floral patterns, meander through the streets. UNESCO has even recognised the city's rickshaw art as the intangible cultural heritage of humanity. Watch out though, even if you're travelling in a stylishly painted rickshaw, it might take you a while to reach your destination: Dhaka has been recognised as the world's slowest city! Whether you're weaving through its alleys on a rickshaw or sampling its spicy street foods, Dhaka is sure to move you, quite literally! Dhaka awaits with open arms and a steaming cup of tea.",

		"description": "You might have seen lakes with some unique colours before, but the Indonesian island of Flores, with its volcano Kelimutu, may steal the show. Home to three lakes, each with its own hue and folklore, this natural wonder attracts travellers seeking an otherworldly experience. Volcanic vents deep within the Earth release steam and gas, which alter the lakes' mineral compositions, causing reactions that transform their appearance periodically.\nEach lake at Kelimutu has its own unique chemical makeup, which is why they can be different colours from each other at the same time and these colours can change independently. The westernmost lake, Tiwu Ata Bupu (Lake of Old People), normally has a blue hue. Meanwhile, Tiwu Ko'o Fai Nuwa Muri (Lake of Young Men and Maidens) tends to be green and Tiwu Ata Polo (Bewitched or Enchanted Lake) is usually red. The local Lio people revere these lakes, believing them to be the resting place of souls. So, why settle for the usual beachside vacation when you can explore a trio of colour-changing lakes?",

It is likely they practised hunting and performed religious ceremonies in this area. If you are a history buff, you might want to try and decode the cryptic messages carved on the rock faces.

Cardinalfish can grow up to 8 centimetres and have tiny shimmery bodies with black vertical stripes and white-edged fins, which help them disguise. Unlike some finned creatures that migrate long distances, these pint-sized fish inhabit a small world, rarely straying far from their local reefs.\nEach young cardinalfish begins life being guarded by their fathers, who carry the eggs in their mouths for up to 30 days to shield them from the aquatic perils. Within these jaws, young fish embark on a silent metamorphosis, soon to emerge, ready to explore the currents. In their early stages, they form dense schools for protection against predators and hide among the spines of sea urchins and anemones. The diet of these opportunistic feeders primarily consists of small fish, crustaceans and plankton. Their existence whispers tales of resilience—a creature to cherish and protect for the spectacle of life it presents.",

More than just a church, this Gothic structure, with its red-tiled dome, is steeped in centuries of history. Built over an older cathedral dedicated to Santa Reparata, construction began in 1296 under the supervision of architect Arnolfo di Cambio. Filippo Brunelleschi, an Italian architect and designer, engineered its dome, which is the largest brick dome ever constructed. It was built without the support of traditional wooden frameworks; its completion in 1436 was the final stage of the cathedral's construction.\nIt's not just the outside that dazzles; inside there are artistic treasures to discover, from Giorgio Vasari's fresco 'The Last Judgement' to Paolo Uccello's intricate clock face. The cathedral complex is also home to the Baptistery, a small basilica and Giotto's Campanile, a free-standing bell tower. Step inside and you're walking on history—every visit gives a glimpse of the past and a demonstration of human potential.",

At the time, homosexuality was illegal, and raids against LGBTQIA+ establishments were common. However, on that night, the patrons of the Stonewall Inn, fed up with the continued harassment, decided to stand their ground. Violence escalated, leading to clashes between protesters and police. In the following days, there was more rioting as people gathered to protest the raids.\nOn June 28 the following year, gay pride marches were held in New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago to mark the anniversary of the riots. Similar marches soon started to be held annually in hundreds of places across the US and the rest of the world. June 28 is now celebrated as International LGBTQIA+ Pride Day. In 2016, the Stonewall Inn, Christopher Park and several nearby streets were officially dedicated as the Stonewall National Monument. So, today is the perfect time to remember those who have fought for LGBTQIA+ rights before, during and after Stonewall.",

Within its glass and granite façade, the gallery houses a collection of over 93,000 artworks, including masterpieces of Canadian and Indigenous art, European classics and more.

Its most emblematic feature is the amphitheatre, seen in today's image. One of the largest in the Roman Empire, it could accommodate up to 25,000 spectators, more than double the city's population. Beyond this, there are remains of impressive public buildings, a temple built in honour of Trajan, baths and villas decorated with stunning mosaics.

But don't be fooled by their names; meerkats are not cats. They're small carnivores of the mongoose family, native to the deserts and grasslands of southwestern Africa. Meerkats are highly social animals, living in tight-knit groups called mobs, which can consist of up to 30 individuals. These groups are a cooperative effort, with meerkats foraging together, grooming each other, babysitting and taking turns as sentinels to watch for predators. These critters create extensive burrows where they spend the night and retreat to escape the midday heat–meerkats love their afternoon siesta.\nWorld Meerkat Day, founded at Taronga Western Plains Zoo in Australia on July 3, 2018, is celebrated all over the world. This day aims to raise awareness about meerkats and their ecological importance. Classed as 'least concern' on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species, these tiny mammals are vital for controlling insect populations in their desert habitats.

There are three types of rock: igneous are formed from solidified magma and lava; sedimentary rocks are layers of sedimentary particles such as sand; and metamorphic rocks are the result of heat and pressure on other kinds of rock.\nToday's image takes us to Cappadocia in central Türkiye, and its stony structures known as fairy chimneys. These cone-shaped pillars are made of tuff, a sedimentary rock that forms as volcanic ash and debris accumulates. On the sides of the rocks, ancient residents of the area carved homes and churches. The area is also famous for its underground cities, which were cut out of the tuff to provide shelter and safety. This is just one of the many uses for rocks that humans have come up with throughout history.",

Japan is made up of 14,125 islands and has 29,751 kilometres of coastline, so it's no wonder the sea plays such a key role in national life. As well as providing much of the country's food, the seas that surround Japan are vital for trading and communicating with other nations.\nTo celebrate this day, many people take a trip to the beach. Another Marine Day tradition is to give something back to the ocean by throwing mudballs into the water; these balls are packed with microorganisms that help to purify the sea. Today's image takes us to Tateishi Park in Yokosuka. This scenic spot has stunning views of Sagami Bay and Mount Fuji, making it the perfect place to celebrate Japan's coastal waters on Marine Day.",

This landscape houses a treasure trove of fossils dating back over 75 million years, offering scientists and visitors a glimpse into the Late Cretaceous period.\nThe first fossil discovered in this park was of an Albertosaurus in 1884, which led to an excavation that uncovered approximately 500 species, including the fossils of Tyrannosaurus rex and Centrosaurus. The sediments exposed in the badlands, seen in today's image, have been around for over 1.5 million years.

The growth of Rothenburg ob der Tauber slowed in the 17th century, preserving its original character. Pictured here is Burgtor or the castle gate, which was built after the original Rothenburg Castle was destroyed by an earthquake in 1356.\nWithin the castle gate is an 'eye-of-the-needle' door, designed to be the only way in and out of the castle when the main gates closed at night. But Rothenburg's magic isn't confined to its walls. It's also a gateway to the 460-kilometre Romantic Road that runs from Würzburg to Füssen, covering Bavaria's castle-studded valleys.

Running from July 15 to 21, Coral Reef Awareness Week is the perfect time to honour them. Coral reefs are formed by tiny marine organisms called coral polyps, which create vast colonies that serve as homes to a diverse array of marine species. As we turn our attention to their beauty and benefits, it's vital to recognise the lurking threats–climate change, pollution and harmful human activities.\nPictured here is Mayotte, a paradise beneath the Indian Ocean's surface. This French Island boasts one of the world's largest and deepest lagoons, encircled by a coral reef of nearly 160 kilometres long. Mayotte's lagoon is home to over 250 species of coral and over 3,500 marine species. But it is facing numerous threats, including overfishing and coral bleaching, where corals expel the algae that live in their tissues, leading to a loss of colour and essential energy sources. So, this week, let's pledge to preserve coral reefs like this one. Dive in, because every splash counts.",

Jaguars arrived in the Americas some 2 million years ago, migrating from Eurasia through the Bering Strait. Today, they inhabit diverse habitats, from the woodlands of the southwestern United States to the rainforests of northern Argentina.\nOften found near bodies of water, jaguars are excellent swimmers, ambushing prey by leaping into the water. True carnivores, jaguars rely exclusively on meat for their nutritional needs. They feed on a wide range of animals, including deer, armadillos, monkeys and lizards. Their strong teeth and jaws can also bite through turtle shells and crocodile heads. In the Brazilian Pantanal, a small population of jaguars primarily feeds on aquatic reptiles and fish. So, the next time you are on a jungle trail, keep your eyes peeled and your senses sharp–remember: every rustle of leaves could be a jaguar on the prowl!",

Initially celebrated as National Moon Day in the United States, the day was recognised globally by the United Nations in 2021. Human civilisations have gazed at the sky for millennia, contemplating the origins and mysteries of the moon. The advent of space exploration transformed the moon into the target of numerous missions.\nApollo 11, the pioneering space mission that first landed humans on the moon, was launched on July 16, 1969. It culminated in the astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin taking the first steps on the moon on July 20, 1969. Moon Day commemorates this historic event and serves as a reminder of the significant efforts required to launch the space program. Moon missions have found no signs of life, but it could be a future site for human colonisation. The discovery of water ice, especially in the dark craters at the poles, makes it more hospitable for potential settlers. So, until you have a chance to live there, keep dreaming under the same moon that has captivated humanity since time immemorial.",

Invented by the Indigenous peoples of Central and South America, hammocks were called 'Hamacas' and were originally woven for sleep and relaxation. Back then hammocks were made from the bark of trees, whereas now they can be made of various materials like cotton, nylon and canvas.\nHammocks come in different shapes and sizes, like Nicaraguan hammocks, which are usually made of woven material with a wooden spreader bar. These sleeping swings have sailed across oceans as sailor beds, swung from the trees as forest dwellers' bedrooms and nowadays, add a touch of chill to hip outdoor retreats. They have health benefits, too; gentle rocking can improve your sleep and even relieve stress. So go ahead, jump into a hammock, and let it gently sway your worries away for a while.",

It now offers refuge to diverse wildlife, like the mountain bluebird, elk, mule deer, white-tailed deer and Canadian goose. The park covers an area of 6,641 square kilometres.\nThe Canadian geese can be recognised by their black heads and white cheek patches, which are also known as 'chinstraps.' They are resilient travellers, enduring thousands of kilometres of migration, flying in a V-shaped formation. While in Banff National Park, you might come across geese teaching their goslings to navigate the waters. It is not just a park; it's a theatre where nature is on display.",

These limestone bridges, towering over a deep gorge, are named after three dragons: Tianlong (Sky Dragon), Qinglong (Azure Dragon) and Heilong (Black Dragon). Tianlong, standing at 235 metres, has a bridge-pier with maze-like caves in it. The Qinglong Bridge, which is 281 metres high, offers breathtaking views when the sun is out. Heilong Bridge is the widest of the three bridges at 193 metres and reaches a height of 223 metres. Visitors can explore the Wulong Karst National Geology Park and visit places like the Furong Cave, a 2,846-metre cave with huge limestone stalactites, which are mineral formations that hang from the ceiling. Standing beneath these magnificent natural bridges, you can't help but be humbled by the sheer power of time and nature.",

This event began in 1930 when Hallmark Cards founder Joyce Hall proposed it as a day for people to acknowledge their friends by sending greeting cards. From exchanging friendship bracelets to sharing social media posts and messages, Canadians have come up with their own special traditions to appreciate their pals.\nThis is a good day to reflect on the many ways friendship impacts our lives, much like the symbiotic relationship between the impala and the red-billed oxpecker, pictured here in South Africa. Both these animals get something out of this relationship: the oxpecker gets food by eating ticks from the impala's skin, while the impala gets to stay clean. This animal duo showcases nature's version of companionship. So, reach out to your friends to express gratitude and simply say, 'I appreciate you.'",

It was also treasured by the Romans for its healing and cleansing properties.\nLavender is planted during the spring season, reaching its peak bloom in July. It doesn't just look good, it smells great too, and is said to help people relax. The fragrant oil is a staple in wellness practices, including aromatherapy, where it's used for stress relief and is a valued ingredient in the perfume industry. This plant is also used in the kitchen, adding a floral touch to dishes and drinks. So, next time you feel stressed let a few drops of the lavender essential oil calm you down.",

The islet is all that remains of a volcano that erupted about 230,000 years ago. According to Hawaiian mythology, Pele the fire goddess was in love with a man named Mo'o. The trouble was that Mo'o was in love with another woman. Pele's revenge was typically violent: she cut her rival in two, her body becoming Molokini, while her head became Pu'u Olai, a cinder cone on Maui.\nMolokini Crater these days is a prime scuba and snorkelling destination; the islet's crescent shape protects divers from waves and currents, allowing them to enjoy the reef. This habitat is home to at least 250 species of fish, including black triggerfish and parrotfish, as well as 38 species of hard coral and some 100 species of algae. So, come on in, the water's lovely. Just be sure not to anger Pele.",

With piercing yellow eyes against a grey-brown face, spotted owlets are often seen when small birds spot them during the day and mob them. Once located, these primarily nocturnal owls will often stare down intruders, bob their heads and emit a loud 'chirurrr-chirurrr-chirurrr' screech, or what's sometimes described as laughter or chuckling.\nStanding around 21 centimetres tall, speckle-plumed spotted owlets can be found from Iran to Vietnam. This one was photographed in Bangkok, Thailand. They primarily eat insects and small mammals like bats and mice, which they often store to eat later when food is scarce. Spotted owlets are a remarkably resilient species that flourish in environments such as semi-deserts, rocky areas, forests, farmlands and urban areas. While they aren't endangered, the spotted owlet's population is thought to have declined in the last four years, perhaps owing to loss of habitat and increased urbanisation.",

One of the major challenges they face is the loss of their languages: it's estimated that of the 4,000 Indigenous languages in the world, around 2,600 are in danger of becoming extinct.\nIn the city of Cusco, Peru, the stone walls of Sacsayhuamán, seen in today's image, murmur tales of the mighty Inca civilisation. The Quechua word Sacsayhuamán means 'the place where the hawk is satisfied'. The citadel's walls, which extended over 540 metres, were built in the 15th century CE. The boulders used to make them were carved and placed without mortar. After the Inca Empire was defeated at a battle here in 1536, Sacsayhuamán was dismantled by the Spanish and the rest of the structure was covered in earth. It was rediscovered in 1934 when the site was excavated. On this day, let's learn the importance of preserving Indigenous cultures and wisdom, as we honour the Indigenous peoples.",

In 2009, the British Cave Research Association led an expedition to explore the site. It was then that they realised something incredible: it was the world's largest cave. How large, you ask? Hang Sơn Đoòng's main passage is 5 kilometres long, 150 metres wide and 200 metres high. That's tall enough to fit a 40-storey skyscraper! Inside, there is a 60-metre calcite barrier called the 'Great Wall of Vietnam' and stalagmites stretching as tall as 80 metres.\nIt even has its own weather system; clouds form inside the cave due to temperature differences between the cave air and the outside air. Moreover, a subterranean river links Hang Sơn Đoòng to the nearby Hang Thung cave, suggesting yet undiscovered depths.

Rockefeller Jr. The park is home to a virtually untouched ecosystem of plants and animals, such as grizzly bears, wolves, bison, moose and bald eagles.\nJust 16 kilometres south of Yellowstone National Park, the park's 64-kilometre-long Teton Range is one of North America's youngest mountain ranges. At less than 10 million years old, erosion has had little geological time to smooth the edges of the mountains, hence the Tetons' jagged peaks. Like its peaks, many of the park's lakes, including the 24-kilometre-long Jackson Lake, were carved out by glaciers hundreds of thousands of years ago.

Ocean City was a quiet fishing village until 1875, when the Atlantic Hotel opened its doors, marking the town's transformation into a burgeoning resort destination. Now, this coastal village is known among travellers from far and wide, including us Canadians seeking sunnier climes. The town's iconic four-kilometre-long boardwalk is lined with restaurants, shops and amusement parks. Pristine sandy beaches that stretch for 16 kilometres are perfect for sunbathing, beach volleyball or building sandcastles, and the ocean waters beckon for a refreshing swim. With plenty of adventure and a heritage deeply rooted in history, Ocean City is a charming retreat that draws visitors back time and again.",

Built between the 10th and 13th centuries, this remarkable site served as a Hindu temple dedicated to the god Shiva. It is on the rim of an extinct volcano, offering views of the surrounding paddy fields and the towering Dongrek Mountains of Cambodia in the distance.\nWith its earthen terraces, the promenade is one of the most striking features in this park filled with intricate stone carvings. Ahead of the promenade is the Phlab Phla, believed to be a bathing area used by royalty before entering the temple that we see here today. Next to it is a passage that stretches on for more than 150 metres, lined with sandstone pillars, which leads to the first of three naga (mythical serpent) bridges that symbolise the transition from the mortal realm to the divine. At the top, the beautifully preserved shrine showcases a wealth of religious motifs, including sculptures of Hindu stories. The annual festival of Phanom Rung, held in April, attracts many who gather to witness the sun's rays aligning with the 15 doorways of the temple and lighting up the inner sanctum.",

The region played a significant role in Maine's logging industry for more than 100 years, but towards the end of the 19th century, this activity began to decline. Efforts to preserve the landscape we see here today were spearheaded by philanthropist Roxanne Quimby. She and her foundation started purchasing land near Baxter State Park in 2001 and donated it to the US federal government in 2016, ensuring its preservation for future generations.\nKatahdin Woods and Waters' diverse ecosystem provides a home for a variety of fauna, including moose, black bear and Canada lynx, in addition to numerous bird species like bald eagle and wood duck. It offers many outdoor activities for visitors, such as hiking, canoeing and camping. The monument has some of the darkest skies in the country due to the lack of electrical lighting in its vast expanse, making it a great place for stargazing.",

These carnivorous creatures thrive in freshwater environments such as slow-moving rivers, lakes and seasonally flooded savannahs. From these waters, they hunt for birds, fish, turtles and occasionally big mammals. Black caimans play an important role in making sure ecosystems stay balanced by keeping their prey's populations under control.

In 1428, a major earthquake struck the area, which was felt in Barcelona more than 80 kilometres away.

These gentle giants have been around for more than 240 million years, but the first specimen was discovered off the coast of South Africa in the 1820s. As the world's largest fish, whale sharks can grow up to 12 metres, with one reaching a record 18.8 metre. Found in tropical oceans around the world, these filter feeders glide through the water, mouth wide open, straining plankton and small fish. Each pattern on their dotted, starry skin is as unique as a human fingerprint.\nSadly, the International Union for Conservation of Nature lists whale sharks as endangered due to overfishing, habitat loss and climate change. Amid adversity, there's hope, like in Cenderawasih Bay in Indonesia, a whale shark oasis that's pictured here. Here, these titans dine on the generosity of fishermen who feed them baitfish for luck, reflecting a unique bond between man and marine life.",

They feature a striking staircase formation, with a two-step cascade created by three layers of basalt.\nBefore these falls became the spot we know today, they had quite a journey. Spanish explorer Alvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca might have been the first European to see the falls. In 1907, businessman Domingo Ayarragaray saw the potential of this area and built a hotel and roads. The falls became such a sensation that they were designated as national parks in both countries—Argentina's Iguazu National Park in 1934 and Brazil's Iguaçu National Park in 1939.

Agile, adaptable and mostly nocturnal, it roams from dense forests to urban playgrounds.\nAt dusk, the red fox sets out on solitary hunts, producing 12 different ranges of vocalisations, from sharp barks to eerie howls. It deftly pursues a diet of rodents, birds and even fruits. An aspect of its interaction is the 'gekkering' it exhibits, a chatter-like sound used mostly in aggressive encounters. Its communication extends beyond sound; the red fox's tail serves as a signal flag to convey different messages to other foxes. It's a subtle and skilfully nuanced language that echoes through the wild.",

Dolphins are highly intelligent and can be found all over the world in oceans, rivers and estuaries. Despite being able to exist in an array of environments and water temperatures, dolphins are threatened by a variety of human activities, such as hunting, pollution and fishing. Hunting in particular led to the creation of World Dolphin Day in 2022 by Sea Shepherd Global, an international marine conservation group.\nThe pod of dolphins seen in today's image was photographed near Réunion, an island in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Madagascar. A wide variety of marine wildlife can be found year-round in Réunion's deeper waters, including many types of sharks, orcas, humpback whales, sea turtles and of course, dolphins. The island's warm, tropical climate is ideal for these creatures, and spinner, bottlenose and rough-toothed dolphins swim in the island's crystal-clear waters.",

With a height of 30 to 105 centimetres, wallabies have strong hind legs that help them take impressive leaps and serve as a defence against predators. During mating season, male wallabies engage in boxing bouts to show dominance in an attempt to grab females' attention. Social creatures, wallabies form small groups called 'mobs,' which provide safety and mutual grooming. Their playgrounds are forests that echo with the thudding of their hops as they navigate their home range with ease.",

		"description": "Autumn is in the air—officially. The September equinox marks the transition from the lush summer to the mellow fall in the Northern Hemisphere, while in the Southern Hemisphere, it signals the beginning of spring. The term 'equinox' is derived from Latin, meaning 'equal night.' During this moment, the Earth's axis is perpendicular to the sun, meaning it rises due east and sets due west, a rare moment of global balance. This balance occurs because the Earth's axis is neither tilted toward nor away from the sun.\nLet's explore Buttermere in England's Lake District which mirrors this equinox enchantment with its tranquil waters and storied shores in today's image. Here, a Norse leader, Jarl Buthar, once defied Norman conquests during the 12th century. Some people think Buttermere's name may come from Buthar, but the more likely explanation is the nearby dairy pastures; Buttermere literally means 'the lake by the dairy pastures.' The lake, approximately 2 kilometres long, is not only a National Trust treasure but also the perfect place to take a break from the hustle and let nature refresh your spirit.",

The otter featured in today's image was photographed in Prince William Sound, Alaska, United States. Sea otters are native to the northern and eastern coasts of the North Pacific Ocean. Weighing 14 to 45 kilograms, they're expert foragers, diving to the seabed to find food. These clever critters are smart as well as cute: they use rocks to crack open shellfish, making them one of the few animals that use tools. There used to be as many as 300,000 in the wild, but they were heavily hunted for almost two centuries, as their dense fur was highly prized.\nBy 1911, it is thought that only around 2,000 were left. Thankfully, an international hunting ban, conservation efforts and reintroduction programs have helped them rebound and they are now found in about two-thirds of their historic habitat. Today, the British Columbia sea otter population is not just surviving but flourishing, with numbers increasing each year. However, there is still a need for awareness as they face threats like oil spills, accidents and pollution. So, whenever you glimpse their fuzzy heads bobbing in the waves, remember, you're witnessing a story of nature's triumph.",

		"description": "There's a reason why famed American photographer Ansel Adams fell in love with Yosemite National Park: vistas like today's image of Half Dome. Located in central California's Sierra Nevada mountain range, the park has been a popular destination for artists, mountaineers, settlers and nature lovers since the mid-1800s. To preserve the area and protect it from logging and overgrazing by cattle, the US Congress designated Yosemite a national park on this day in 1890. It's one of the most visited parks in the United States, with annual attendance exceeding 3 million, and it's a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nAt almost 2,696 metres tall, Half Dome—named because it looks like a dome that's been cut in half—is only one of Yosemite's geological wonders. Other famous climbing destinations include El Capitan and Mount Lyell, which at 3,997 metres tall is the park's highest summit. Yosemite is also famous for its waterfalls and is home to giant sequoia trees, black bears, mountain lions and endangered Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep.",

On the banks of the Yamuna River in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India, this ivory-white marble mausoleum will certainly leave an impression. The Taj, seen in today's image, was commissioned in 1631 by Shah Jahan, the fifth Mughal emperor, to honour his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal. This tomb is the centrepiece of a huge complex, which also includes a mosque, a guest house and beautifully landscaped gardens surrounded by a grand wall. Laid out in a striking rectangular shape, the tomb is flanked by giant arches and alcoves that merge Indo-Islamic and Mughal architectural styles. This mausoleum draws inspiration from notable structures such as the Gur-e Amir in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, and Humayun's Tomb and Shah Jahan's Jama Masjid in Delhi.\nIt's also an incredible architectural feat, with the outer dome reaching around 44 metres and the inner one standing more than 24 metres.

Found in the Indo-Pacific region, including Indonesia, Australia and Okinawa in Japan, mototi octopuses are masters of disguise. They usually have a dull orange-cream-brown colour but when alarmed, they can quickly shift to striking maroon with white stripes along their body and arms. Also known as poison ocellate octopuses, these cephalopods are highly venomous.

These trees are the most widespread native species in North America, with Pando, located in Utah's Fishlake National Forest, being a massive quaking aspen grove. Their fall foliage is breathtaking, with their leaves turning a vibrant yellow that lights up the landscape, as seen in today's photo, which was taken near Marble, Colorado.\nAspens are not only beautiful but also biologically fascinating. They grow in large colonies that originate from a single root system, making them some of the largest living organisms on Earth. Each tree in the colony is genetically identical. When an aspen tree is cut down or damaged, the root system remains alive, allowing new shoots to emerge and grow, which helps create a resilient network that can survive harsh conditions, including wildfires. This species quickly colonises areas that have been recently burned down and can regenerate even after frequent fires. Closer to home. the Aspen parkland is an ecological region that —retches across 397,304 square kilometres, covering parts of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. Aspen trees are more than just a treat for the eyes; they are an example of nature's resilience.",

The bar-tailed godwit embarks on an 11,000-kilometre nonstop flight across the Pacific from Alaska to New Zealand. The tiny ruby-throated hummingbird, weighing less than a nickel, makes the trip across the Gulf of Mexico—a seemingly impossible feat for its size. Migratory birds navigate the globe, instinctively knowing when and where to move to exploit seasonal abundance. The Arctic tern outshines them all with its intercontinental journey from pole to pole, covering 30,000 kilometres. Their migration routes are passages created based on environmental cues.\nLet's take a moment to admire the vibrant plumage of the wood duck, photographed in Quebec, and featured here today. Wood ducks, like the one in today's image, nest in tree cavities close to water and sometimes take advantage of man-made boxes. During the breeding season, from February to April, you'll find the females laying 7–15 eggs. After breeding in the eastern and western United States and southern Canada, these ducks migrate southward in the fall to avoid harsh winter conditions.

Within the Alcázar, there are several courtyards lined with delicately carved columns. One of these is the Patio de las Doncellas, or Courtyard of the Maidens, pictured here today.\nIn the centre of this beautiful space is a pool, whose still waters provide reflections of not only the blue Andalucian sky above, but of the intricate latticework of the courtyard's arches. Look a little closer at these arches, and you'll see carved shells, Hands of Fatima—a symbol said to bring protection—plants and Arabic script. Behind the columns, the walls are decorated with colourful ceramic times decorated with geometric patterns. These tiles, known as 'azulejos,' are a hallmark of Andalusian decoration.

One of the most dramatic moments of the migration is the crossing of the Mara River. Thousands of wildebeests gather at the riverbank, aware that danger lurks beneath the surface—the crocodiles—not to mention the lions and leopards that patrol the banks. When the first wildebeest takes the plunge, it's a wild rush as the rest of the herd follows, creating a chaotic scene. Some make it across, while others become part of the food chain.

Sloths are mainly leaf eaters, although they also snack on fruits and tree sap to keep them going. To help them break down those tough, fibrous leaves, they have a special multi-chambered stomach. With their super slow metabolism, digestion takes its sweet time, and they don't need much food each day to get by. It's not just their stomachs that move at a leisurely pace; they're so slow-moving that algae often develop on their fur, giving a greenish tint, which handily also provides them camouflage.",

In today's image, we're transported to the George L. Smith State Park, which spans 6.61 square kilometres in Emanuel County, Georgia, United States. The park's centrepiece, seen in today's image, is a 1.67 square kilometre mill pond, a favourite spot for fishing and canoeing. Out of its waters grow pond cypress and bald cypress trees, two varieties that are native to the country. Winding through the park are over 11 kilometres of nature trails, leading visitors through sandy landscapes past a bird sanctuary and tortoise habitat.\nIn Canada, the yellow cypress primarily thrives in the coastal mountains of British Columbia, braving the alpine slopes and misty havens, where few other trees dare to grow. Scientifically known as Callitropsis nootkatensis, it is also called Nootka Cypress, named after the Nuu-chah-nulth people of Vancouver Island.",

Down an unassuming side street, there's a surprise waiting for you: a house of monsters. Welcome to the Palazzo Zuccari, a 16th-century palace where myths seem to come to life on its façade—grotesque faces swallow up its doors and windows. Federico Zuccari, who built the palace, was well-versed in monsters. His painting of the Last Judgement in Florence Cathedral and his illustrations of Dante's Inferno are replete with mythical beings.\nThe monster door originally led to the palazzo's garden because Zuccari enjoyed making his guests experience the contrast between the scary entrance and the beautiful serenity of the garden. These days, the door leads to the Bibliotheca Hertziana, a library specialising in Italian art history, from the Middle Ages to the modern day, which has occupied the site of the garden since 1912. If you're looking for more monstrous mouths in Rome, not far from the Palazzo Zuccari is the Bocca della Verità, an ancient Roman mask. According to legend, it will bite off any liar's hand that's placed in its mouth.",

It was once the site of an extravagant house built in the 1930s by Madame Antoinette Sherri, a flamboyant 1920s costume designer known for her lavish parties. Madame Sherri's dramatic arrivals in town, often in a chauffeur-driven Packard, draped in furs, became the talk of the locals. As her fortune declined, her 'castle' fell into disrepair and was vandalised. In 1959, she returned to find her property in ruins and never came back. A fire destroyed the house in 1963, leaving behind only the stone foundation, an iconic staircase and a large fireplace leading to a lone chimney.\nToday, the forest where her house once stood spans over 2 square kilometres and offers scenic hiking trails through woodlands, hemlock groves and peaceful brooks, a picturesque setting for outdoor enthusiasts. Managed by the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests, this area was named in honour of Madame Sherri, and it also includes trails that lead to the ruins of her former estate. So, while the house was originally separate from the forest, the two are now intricately entwined.",

Bodey, a prospector who discovered gold but tragically died in a blizzard before seeing the town's rise. When large deposits of gold were found there, it grew to nearly 10,000 residents, with saloons, dance halls and breweries lining its streets. But as the gold ran dry, so did the town's fortunes. The mines closed, the population dwindled and by 1915, the place was abandoned. Bodie's streets are now empty, its wooden buildings frozen in decay.\nToday, it is one of America's best-preserved ghost towns. Wandering through the streets, you can peer into dusty homes and storefronts and even find small artefacts like shards of china and square nails from the glory days. Legend has it that Bodie's ghosts fiercely guard the town and those who take souvenirs risk being cursed with bad luck. If that doesn't scare you, taking items home is against the park's rules. So, if you find yourself here, be sure to leave with nothing but memories—lest the town's spirits follow you home.",

The towering presence of Mont Blanc, seen in this image, has left an indelible mark on literature, most notably on Mary Shelley's 'Frankenstein.' The last Friday of October is Frankenstein Friday, honouring Shelley's literary genius and the fascinating creature born from her imagination. 'Frankenstein' was conceived during a ghost story challenge. In 1816, an 18-year-old Shelley, along with fellow writers Percy Bysshe Shelley, John Polidori and Lord Byron, spent a stormy summer in Switzerland. There, she penned the tale of Victor Frankenstein and the Creature. A pivotal scene in the novel takes place on a glacier near Mont Blanc, where Victor is confronted by his monstrous creation. This setting, with its surreal beauty and treacherous terrain, perfectly captures a sense of awe and terror.\n'Frankenstein,' also known as 'Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus,' was first published anonymously in 1818. Shelley's use of the epistolary form—a novel told through letters—and her blend of Gothic and early science fiction made 'Frankenstein' a timeless classic.",

In Canada, as Irish immigrants settled, abundant pumpkins became the ideal substitutes for the turnips and potatoes they had previously used to create lanterns. By hollowing out pumpkins and lighting them with candles, they transformed the gourds into flickering defences against evil spirits.\nThe image of a pumpkin field in Victoria, British Columbia, seen today, captures the essence of this season. Every year, from late September to October, the fields of Quebec and the farms of British Columbia are full of this orange fruit. Visitors often flock to these fields for the quintessential pumpkin-picking experience. These gourds become canvases for masterpieces, with ghoulish and whimsical displays adorning porches to welcome trick-or-treaters. As people gather to scoop, carve and light their pumpkins, they participate in a shared ritual that transcends cultures. Beyond their role as porch decorations, pumpkins fill pies and spice up lattes, adding an element to the season that many anticipate all year long. Once merely a fruit, the pumpkin now enjoys a revered place in Halloween celebrations.",

With its keen vision, eerie vocalisations and silent flight, this owl has historically been revered and feared. In folklore and mythology, owls were considered symbols of wisdom and omens of death. On Samhain, the Celtic precursor to Halloween, the owl was believed to be the kin of roaming spirits.\nThe owl in today's image is far more than a character in ghostly tales. Often called the 'tiger of the air,' the great horned owl, named for its signature feathers that look like horns, is one of the most fearsome and adaptable predators in the ornithological world. Primarily active at night, the owl has large, powerful talons that exert huge amounts of pressure, which it uses to grab prey like small rodents and skunks. It has incredible night vision, but its eyes are fixed, so it must turn its head a whopping 270 degrees to see everything. So, whether you hear it hooting from treetops or see it flying in the night, this owl proves that not all scary apparitions are supernatural.",

Positioned high on an extinct volcano, these fortress walls have seen wars, royal births, executions and plenty of other drama since the 11th century. What really sets it apart is its reputation as one of Scotland's most haunted spots. It's no surprise that with more than 1,000 years of history, some have reported ghost sightings.\nLegend has it that the Grey Lady, Janet Douglas, roams the castle's corridors. Also known as Lady Glamis, a noblewoman accused of witchcraft by King James V, she is believed to still lament her fiery execution in 1537. Others say the Grey Lady might be the ghost of Marie de Guise—mother of Mary, Queen of Scots—mourning her lost power amid the turmoil of religious reform. Then there's the Dung Man, a prisoner who attempted to escape in a wheelbarrow full of excrement. He died from the fall when the cart was emptied from the castle wall. The lost piper, who vanished into underground tunnels, continues to play a haunting melody beneath the city. In 2001, the shadowy figure of a man in a leather apron emerged during a paranormal research project, leaving volunteers with a chilling memory. Spooked yet?",

The Caribbean flamingo is the largest flamingo species in the Americas and the only one native to North America. These vibrant birds are typically found around brackish and saltwater areas, like marshes, estuaries and along coastlines. Because of their pink colour, they're often confused with roseate spoonbills. However, their long necks and bent bills distinguish them from other wading birds like the great blue heron and wood stork.",

Over time, Banff's boundaries expanded, and it became part of the Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks UNESCO World Heritage Site. Spanning over 6,600 square kilometres, this national park transforms into a snowy playground during the winter, attracting visitors eager for skiing, snowshoeing, curling, skijoring and wildlife tours that offer plenty to explore. Despite the cold, life thrives in the park: it's home to a variety of wildlife, including elk, grizzly bears, mountain goats and wolves. Lodgepole pines and spruces also stand resilient against harsh weather. Banff's flora and fauna are closely monitored, ensuring that this balance remains intact.",

The story of this otherworldly landscape starts 65 million years ago when a dry seabed stood here. Over time, geological forces warped and squeezed the land, twisting the sandstone into lumps and bumps. Later, wind and water carved out the arches, pinnacles, fins and balanced rocks that now stand in this area. The park has more than 2,000 natural stone arches, the highest concentration of these structures anywhere on Earth. In today's image, we can see two of them: Double Arch, as seen through Cove Arch. The larger arch of Double Arch spans 44 metres and is 34 metres tall, the tallest and second-longest of the park's arches.",

Together, they hold 21% of the world's fresh surface water. Of these, Lake Ontario, standing between the states of Ontaio and New York, has the smallest surface area and was named 'Ontario' by Europeans in 1641. Covering approximately 18,960 square kilometres, it has been an important waterway for centuries. By the 18th century, the lake had become a strategic hub for the fur trade, particularly during the French and Indian War and later the War of 1812. Today, historic forts like Fort Niagara and Fort Henry stand as reminders of these turbulent times near the lake.",

Although it was chosen by Napoleon as the site of his coronation as emperor in 1804, by the early 19th century, the cathedral was in a state of disrepair. However, one novel changed its fortunes: 'The Hunchback of Notre-Dame' by Victor Hugo. The popularity of this book helped encourage a restoration project that renewed the cathedral's former beauty.",

These creatures, part of the same family as camels, alpacas and llamas, are native to the rugged landscapes of South America. Standing around 110 centimetres tall and weighing up to 90 kilograms, guanacos travel in herds led by a dominant male, accompanied by females and their young. After a gestation period of around 11 months, females give birth to a single baby—known as a chulengo—which is able to stand and walk within an hour of birth. Their diet, consisting of grasses, shrubs and lichens, enables them to flourish in harsh, mountainous terrain. Guanaco's soft, warm fur—first introduced for textile use in the mid-1900s—is highly prized. It is used to create luxury fabrics and is valued second only to vicuña wool across the Americas.",

Each autumn, hundreds of polar bears gather near here, waiting for the bay to freeze so they can hunt seals again—their primary food source. Ever wonder how they stay warm? A thick layer of fat and a dense undercoat trap heat. Their tangle-resistant hairs shake dry after swimming, and natural oils stop the coat from freezing. Sadly, warmer temperatures delay that freeze, forcing the bears to fast longer. To cope with the delay, they rest, conserve energy and sometimes wander the area. Scientists track their movements to learn how migration patterns shift each year. Polar Bear Week celebrates these mammals while reminding us that their future depends on what we do about a warming planet.",

		"description": "Perched on a terrace above the Inn Valley at 1,460 metres, Ardez is a hidden gem in eastern Switzerland renowned for its deep cultural roots and stunning preservation of history. This picturesque village, starring in today's image, showcases the rich traditions and unique language of Switzerland's Romansh-speaking communities. Its homes are adorned with sgraffiti—decorative designs etched into plaster—and colourful murals, both iconic art styles of the Engadin region. Dating back to 840 when it was first referred to as Ardezis, the village's history includes Steinsberg Castle, originally owned by the Bishop of Chur. Though destroyed during the Swabian War in 1499, the castle's tower has been restored multiple times and stands today as a proud reminder of its past. In 1975, Ardez was chosen as a Swiss model village for its exceptional preservation efforts, which have kept its historic charm intact.\nThe nearby Chastè site is a treasure trove of history, recognised as a Swiss heritage site of national significance. This fascinating location encompasses layers of human settlement, from the late Bronze Age through the early Iron Age and even includes artifacts from the Roman Empire. Against this backdrop, the star trails in today's photo illuminate the timeless allure of Ardez, where history and natural beauty converge.",

Today, on Tolkien Day, fans around the world honour the master storyteller who crafted the epic adventures of Middle-earth: J.R.R. Tolkien. While Tolkien may have started the tale, it's his readers who carry it forward, generation after generation, diving into the pages of 'The Hobbit,' 'The Lord of the Rings' and beyond. Tolkienists are encouraged to celebrate the author's birthday with a toast at 9 PM local time—to participate, all you must do is stand and raise a glass of your choice, say 'The Professor,' and take a sip.\nFor today's featured image, it is only fitting to visit a place that might have inspired the literary legend: the Radcliffe Camera, or Rad Cam, at the University of Oxford in England. Originally a science library, the domed, circular building now serves as a reading room for the Bodleian Library. This 18th-century building is said to be an inspiration for Sauron's temple to Morgoth on Númenor in Tolkien's fiction. Though Tolkien himself didn't study there—he was a student at Exeter College—he would have passed by the Rad Cam countless times during his years as a professor of English Language and Literature at Oxford. This building, with its extraordinary exterior, continues to captivate visitors and Tolkien enthusiasts alike.",

Tucked between the karst hills of Daxin County in China and Trùng Khánh district in Vietnam, these falls tumble along the Quây Sơn River. Over 25 metres tall and 300 metres wide, it holds the distinction of being the widest waterfall in Vietnam. Located just 69 kilometres north of Hanoi, this waterfall has gradually worn away its crest over the years, inching upstream. For most of the year, they flow as two distinct cascades, but come summer, when the rains swell the river, they merge into one big fall.\nEver wondered what 168,000 cubic metres of water rushing over a cliff sound like? Just as Bản Giốc stuns with its beauty, Niagara Falls in Ontario, Canada, captivates with its scale and thundering sound. This side steals the show with the Horseshoe Falls, a massive curtain of water. More than a pretty face, these falls are a powerhouse, literally. Back in 1895, they lit up the world's first major hydroelectric power station, thanks to Nikola Tesla's genius. On calmer days, the mist and rainbow make for perfect photo ops, but come winter, Niagara transforms into a frozen wonderland.",

These calls help them stay connected while foraging or alerting the flock to nearby threats. Breeding starts around February, peaking by April to June. These birds are cavity nesters, often using hollowed-out tree trunks to lay their eggs. Both parents play a role in feeding and protecting the chicks.

This Romanesque church, originally built in 450 CE, features a sturdy square bell tower added in the 9th century, enhancing the basilica's exterior. Its design features three naves, divided by two rows of 12 columns each. Featured in today's image is the basilica's real showstopper: the basement crypt or a burial chamber is a stunning model of early religious design. Complete with vaulted ceilings that slope down into rows of stone columns, its floor is a work of art itself. It's inlaid with beautifully intricate mosaic tiles that have withstood the test of time.\nBuilt on soft marshland, Ravenna faces ongoing structural challenges because the entire city is gradually sinking. This is particularly evident in the crypt, which now remains perpetually submerged under about a foot of water. But instead of battling the slow flood, Ravenna has embraced it, filling the pool with goldfish that glide between the ancient columns and above the submerged mosaics. Visitors here often toss coins into the water, likely wishing for good luck, making this crypt more of a wishing well than a burial site.",

Although rocks are common, few of us take the time to consider how remarkable they are. Forged in volcanoes or moulded by millennia of pressure, these solid masses of minerals hold the key to understanding how our planet formed. Rocks can also contain fossils, the remnants of long-extinct organisms. Canada is home to some jaw-dropping geological wonders. Take Hopewell Rocks in New Brunswick, for example. These giant, flowerpot-like formations were carved by the Bay of Fundy's massive tides, which rise and fall by up to 14 metres daily. Then there's the Mingan Archipelago in Quebec. This collection of limestone monoliths, shaped by waves and wind, is over 450 million years old.\nNow, since we’re talking about rocks, one of the world's most curious displays can be found on Koekohe Beach in New Zealand. The Moeraki Boulders, some of which are 2 metres in diameter, have been shaped by nature over millions of years. Each boulder began as a pebble on the seabed around 65 million years ago. Over time, layers of mud and silt built up around them, cemented together by calcite. Thanks to erosion and the movement of the sea, the boulders eventually emerged. Today, new boulders continue to appear, while the elements gradually break down the existing ones.",

Welcome to the Namib desert, spanning thousands of kilometres across Namibia. Estimated to be 55 million years old, it is believed to be the oldest desert in the world. It also boasts some of the tallest sand dunes on Earth, including the famous 'Big Daddy,' which towers roughly 325 metres; Dune 7, the highest dune in Namibia at 383 metres; and Dune 45, which, at roughly 170 metres, is a favourite among photographers.\nAt the heart of this vast, arid expanse is Sossusvlei, seen in today's image. A salt and clay pan surrounded by towering dunes, Sossusvlei tells a story of contrasts. Every 10 years or so, an extraordinary event occurs when the Tsauchab River floods the pan, transforming it into a stunning turquoise lake. Nearby is the eerie Dead Vlei, with its ancient, desiccated camelthorn trees, which remain frozen in time as the extremely dry climate keeps them from decaying.

Created in 1972, Abraham Lake is a man-made reservoir that spans more than 53 square kilometres along the North Saskatchewan River. Thanks to glacier-fed waters from the Rocky Mountains, the lake stays transparent even in the coldest months. The glacial meltwater carries fine sediment that scatters sunlight, while natural filtration through rocks keeps pollutants to a minimum.\nThe snowy season attracts photographers and visitors from around the world who are eager to capture a rare sight at Preacher's Point: the bubbles. These frozen globes form when microorganisms break down dead plants and animals on the lake bed, releasing methane. As the gas rises, it gets trapped by the ice, creating layers of bubbles in various sizes and shapes. It's wild to think that they're flammable and chilling under your feet. The ice is thickest in January and February, making the bubbles clearly visible. If you're planning to check it out, just remember to stick close to the shoreline for your safety.",

Meknes reflects the Moroccan style of architecture, with one of its most impressive landmarks being Heri es-Swani, seen in today's image.\nHeri es-Swani was originally constructed as a stable and for storing vast amounts of grain to sustain the settlement and the Sultan's armies. Its design was both practical and impressive—thick walls and an innovative cooling system helped maintain the food supply. Twenty-two rows of symmetrical arches divided the space into corridors that used to have vaulted ceilings. Back then, mules climbed onto the roof terrace to deliver grain, which was then dropped through specially designed holes in the ceiling below. The structure housed more than 12,000 horses. Today, it stands as an empty shell, acting as a scenic backdrop ready to be explored. This historical monument is a must-see for anyone curious about how empires were built and fed.",

As part of this tradition, Calennig, meaning 'New Year's gift' in Welsh, plays a central role, linking the celebration to customs from the Julian calendar era. Even after most of the world switched to the Gregorian calendar in 1582, some Welsh communities clung to their old ways. Traditionally, the day involves children going door-to-door, singing songs and offering good wishes in exchange for gifts like coins, food or sweets. A unique feature is its clove-decorated apples. These aren't for snacking, though; they're miniature symbols of luck and prosperity.\nWhile these old traditions have evolved in some parts of Wales, the spirit of Calennig thrives. Cities like Cardiff, the capital of Wales, have transformed the celebration into large-scale events, complete with fireworks, markets and community gatherings. If your New Year's resolutions are already wobbling by January 13, Calennig offers a do-over. So why not embrace a little Welsh magic?

This land owes its formations to an ancient volcanic eruption that occurred 23 million years ago. The fiery beginnings made towering spires, cliffs and talus caves—created by falling boulders wedged into narrow canyons. Over millennia, tectonic forces shifted the landmass northward, leaving the park far from its volcanic birthplace. Talk about a journey!\nThis place offers a variety of trails, from easy walks to challenging climbs. The High Peaks Trail, featured in today's image, tests your stamina with steep climbs and narrow passages, while Bear Gulch Reservoir provides a more relaxed stroll.

The entire cave complex stretches on for around 4 kilometres, although visitors can only access about 304 metres of the total. Inside, there's a labyrinth of lit pathways winding past stalactite and stalagmite formations, leading to a 118-metre-long saltwater lake.\nNeptune's Grotto is near the town of Alghero on the northwest coast of Sardinia, the second largest island in the Mediterranean. It has been inhabited for at least 10,000 years, but its most important ancient civilisation, the Nuragic peoples, lived there from around 1800 BCE until the 2nd century CE. At this time, villages were built around nuraghes, a kind of round tower fortress. Today, there are still around 7,000 of these nuraghes across the island, and they have become a symbol of Sardinia.

		"description": "Today's image features the brown pelican, a bird that doesn't just fly but soars, spots and dives with unmatched precision. Although it's the smallest of the eight pelican species worldwide, it's still a large bird, measuring about 1.2 metres in length and having a wingspan of 2 metres. It's a marine-dwelling species and can be spotted along the Atlantic coast of the Americas, from New Jersey to the mouth of the Amazon River. On the Pacific coast, it can be spotted from British Columbia all the way to Peru, including a stop at the Galapagos Islands.\nThe brown pelican is a piscivore, meaning its diet mainly consists of fish. Dixon Lanier Merritt's limerick famously begins, 'A wonderful bird is the pelican; his bill can hold more than his belly can,' and it's spot on—its pouch can store up to three times the volume of its stomach. This versatile feature acts as a scoop, a tool for cooling off during hot weather and a feeding trough for young pelicans. In addition to the brown pelican, one can easily spot the American white pelican flying in Canadian skies. It is one of the largest birds in North America and is found from the interior of British Columbia, east to northwestern Ontario.",

These little rodents are found across most of the globe, and today is their special day: Squirrel Appreciation Day. This unofficial holiday was started by a North Carolina wildlife rehabilitator to encourage people to leave out seeds and nuts for these critters. From the tiny least pygmy squirrel—just 14 centimetres long—to the Bhutan giant flying squirrel at more than 122 centimetres, these mammals come in all shapes and sizes.\nToday's image features a Eurasian red squirrel, photographed in the Netherlands. The red squirrel can be found across Europe and Russia, from western Spain and Portugal all the way to eastern Siberia. Their diet mainly consists of nuts, fungi, seeds and berries, but they will occasionally eat birds' eggs. In addition to being the national mammal of Denmark, they also play a part in old Norse mythology. Ratatoskr is a red squirrel who scurries up and down Yggdrasil, the sacred tree, carrying messages and spreading gossip. So, next time you spot a red squirrel, it could just be a furry little messenger!",

Tucked in the heart of Jordan's arid desert landscapes, this ancient city once thrived as the capital of the Nabataean Kingdom in the 2nd century BCE. It was also a hub of the spice trade, connecting distant regions like China, Egypt, Greece and India. The city was abandoned for around 500 years before being rediscovered in 1812, earning it the 'Lost City' moniker.\nAd-Deir, seen in today's image, dates to the 1st century CE. Its design is characterised by a combination of Hellenistic and Mesopotamian influences. Although the exact purpose of the structure is debated, it's believed to have been used as a church during the Byzantine period. Standing nearly 45 metres tall and 48 metres wide, its massive facade is carved directly into the sandstone cliffs, showcasing the Nabataeans' ingenious craftsmanship and architecture. The journey to this landmark involves a steep hike up 800 stone steps, winding through rocky terrain.

		"description": "What could be better than warming up winter with a feast that's a little wild and a lot of fun? Thorrablot, Iceland's midwinter festival, invites you to dive headfirst into tradition. This celebration of survival, culture and community, which dates to the Viking Age, was once a way for Icelanders to honour Thor, the Norse god of thunder. Today, people celebrate by gathering to feast on an array of local delicacies, including fermented shark, smoked lamb, rye bread and shots of Brennivín—often called 'black death' schnapps.\nStrokkur geyser—featured in the image—warms up winter in a completely different way. Located in the geothermal area beside the Hvítá River, this geyser erupts every 6 to 10 minutes, shooting hot water 15–20 metres into the air. It has been consistently active since 1963. There is science behind its eruption—magma beneath the Earth's crust heats groundwater until the pressure builds up, forcing the water explosively to the surface. Both Thorrablot and Strokkur celebrate Iceland's resilience—one through its people and the other through its land.",

With its smooth grey bark, short trunk and sweeping branches, this tree is a standout in Belgium's forests, as shown in today's image. It grows in temperate regions and prefers well-drained, fertile soils, taking up to 30 years to mature. Not only do these 50-metre tall trees dominate the landscape, but their wood is also used to make some of the sturdiest furniture, flooring and even kitchen tools. Wildlife such as black bears, foxes, squirrels, chipmunks and mice love them too—beech nuts, though slightly bitter, provide a feast for all kinds of critters. In winter, the beech forests in Belgium become even more enchanting.\nIn Canada, the American beech is a fascinating part of the country's natural heritage. These deciduous trees are native to eastern Canada, thriving in regions like Ontario, Quebec and parts of the Maritimes. Historically, these trees were highly valued by Indigenous communities. The tree's durable wood was used for tools and floor planks, while the nuts were sometimes collected as a food source. They are also slow-growing but resilient and can live over 300 years.",

It's home to some stunning geographic features, like Zoroaster Temple, featured in today's image. This towering 2,100-metre summit is in Coconino County. The peak was named after the ancient Iranian prophet Zoroaster by George Wharton James, an American photographer and journalist and Clarence Dutton, an American geologist.

		"description": "The short-eared owl, featured in today's image, is a grassland-dwelling member of the owl family. Found on all continents except Antarctica and Australia, it is one of the most widely distributed bird species. This winged bird is found across Canada, primarily in open habitats such as grasslands, prairies and wetlands. This raptor belongs to the genus Asio, whose members are characterised by feather tufts ('ears') on their heads. The short-eared owl only reveals its tufts when feeling defensive. Because of its irregular wingbeats, its flight is on the floppy side, much like a moth or bat. It likes to glide a few metres above the ground in open fields and grasslands, swooping down feet-first to grab its prey\nOwls primarily hunt at night, but this silent hunter is also active during the day and at dusk. Its daylight hunts often coincide with the peak activity of small rodents called voles—its favourite meal. Known to relocate to areas with higher rodent populations, the short-eared owl even wanders nomadically in search of better food supplies during years when vole populations are low. In the breeding season, it is commonly found in the prairie provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, as well as in parts of Ontario and Quebec. During migration, it can be spotted across much of southern Canada. In winter, short-eared owls may move south to more temperate regions, but they are also known to remain in some areas of southern Canada if food and suitable habitat are available.",

Though it is celebrated mostly in Ontario, other places like Nova Scotia and Quebec also take part in the fun. The tradition has deep roots, first appearing in the early 1800s when European settlers brought similar customs to North America. Historically, Europeans celebrated today as the first day of spring, and Germans originally watched badgers and other small animals for signs of seasonal change important to farmers.\nThe alpine marmot in today's image is a close relative of the groundhog, which is another species of marmot.

The town is home to the Svans, a cultural and linguistic subgroup of Georgians. Despite its modest size, Mestia has been an essential hub of Georgian culture for centuries, dotted with the Svan defensive towers, seen in today's image. Most of these towers were constructed between the 9th and 12th centuries, a period often referred to as Georgia's Golden Age. However, their roots are believed to stretch even further back, possibly into prehistoric times. Built for both protection and shelter, these towers were not just fortresses but also integral parts of family homes, reflecting the region's history of resilience and self-sufficiency. Therefore, it isn't just a town; it's a living museum where history rises from these towers and echoes through the mountains.",

Carved into sandstone cliffs over 1,500 years ago during the Northern Wei dynasty (386–534/535 CE), the grottoes contain 254 caves. The highlight is the massive Buddha in Cave 5, which is a jaw-dropping 18 metres tall. But don't stop there—each cave offers something unique. Some are like ancient storyboards, depicting tales from Buddhist scriptures, while others showcase detailed carvings of monks, deities, musicians and even scenes of daily life under Wei rule.\nCaves 16–20, known as the 'Tanyao Five Caves,' were the first to be carved at Yungang, overseen by the monk Tanyao. While you're there, be sure to explore Cave 20's seated Buddha idol in a meditation posture, with a standing attendant Buddha on one side. What's fascinating is that these caves blend influences from Indian, Central Asian and local Chinese Buddhist art.

As an English naturalist, geologist and biologist, his theory of natural selection revolutionised our understanding of species, evolution and our role in the natural world. His work, 'On the Origin of Species,' published in 1859, laid the foundation for modern evolutionary biology. This day marks the birthday of Darwin and honours his genius while promoting curiosity, science and critical thinking. From thought-provoking talks to engaging exhibits, this day motivates us to keep exploring.\nSpeaking of cool science, marine iguanas, found only on the Galápagos Islands, serve as an example of Darwin's evolutionary principles. These reptiles, seen in today's image, are the only lizards in the world that forage in the sea, diving to graze on algae growing on submerged rocks. They've adapted in remarkable ways, from flattened tails for swimming to salt glands that allow them to expel seawater by sneezing. During his visit to the islands in 1835, Darwin noted their appearance as being like 'imps of darkness' but also recognised how perfectly they were adapted to their harsh environment.",

Over time, climate changes caused water levels to drop; these days, the lake is normally dry, except in winter when it's covered in around 5 centimetres of water. The name 'Tyrrell' comes from the local Wergaia word for 'sky,' a nod to the Boorong Aboriginal People's interest in astronomy. Spanning more than 18,180 square kilometres, Lake Tyrrell is a haven for wildlife, including Mallee reptiles, kangaroos and emus.\nIn recent years, the lake has become a tourist hotspot. People come from all over the world during the winter months, drawn by its mirror-like surface that reflects the endless Australian sky, making it the perfect photo op. The salt formations on the lakebed also provide a stunning backdrop for photographs.

Yet, thanks to conservation efforts, their populations are rebounding in many regions across Europe.\nOtters are naturally playful, often sliding down snowy or muddy banks and diving underwater to find pebbles to play with.

Polar bears are native to the Arctic and can be found in Alaska, Russia, Greenland and Svalbard. They're also found in Canada—like the cub in today's image, photographed in Churchill, Manitoba.\nPolar bears spend over half of their time hunting for seals on the sea ice, although they usually catch just one or two for every 10 that they try to catch. Their reliance on sea ice for hunting means that they are highly vulnerable to climate change. Sea ice is rapidly disappearing as the planet heats up, and polar bears are at risk of malnutrition and starvation as their hunting grounds vanish. Shrinking ice sheets also mean that these bears have to swim farther to find food, which depletes their energy reserves.

		"description": "Nature's desert navigators—desert bighorn sheep—are a marvel to watch, effortlessly scaling cliffs and navigating rocky terrains with grace. Native to North America, these sheep are known for their distinctive curled horns, which can weigh up to 14 kilograms. Rams use their massive horns in intense head-butting contests. During these battles, males hurl themselves at each other in charges of up to 32 kilometres per hour. Ewes, on the other hand, tend to keep things more low-key, forming smaller groups with their lambs. Adapted to the desert environment, bighorn sheep can go long periods without water, relying on moisture from plants to survive. In Canada, they inhabit the Rocky Mountains, including parts of British Columbia, Alberta and Yukon.\nValley of Fire State Park seen in today's image, is one of the best spots in Nevada, United States, to observe these desert dwellers. This park is named for its fiery red sandstone formations that seem to glow under the sun. Beyond its natural beauty, the park holds deep historical significance, with petroglyphs left by ancient Indigenous peoples. It has also earned a place in pop culture as a filming location for scenes from 'Star Trek Generations.' Keep an eye on the rocky outcrops during your visit—you might spot a bighorn sheep observing you.",

		"description": "Some places feel almost untouched by time. In Canada, one such place sits deep in Jasper National Park, Alberta, where the 22-kilometre-long, winding Maligne Lake cuts through the mountains. It is the largest natural lake in the Canadian Rockies, where towering peaks, glacial waters and endless sky come together.\nEarly Indigenous communities, including the Dane-zaa, Nakoda and Cree, have long used the area surrounding the lake for hunting and travel, and their connection to the land continues to this day. In 1907, guide Mary Schäffer mapped the lake, bringing it to wider attention. Spirit Island, a small tree-covered island in the lake, became a well-known landmark after photographers captured its striking reflection in the water. Now, it's a favourite for paddlers, hikers and those chasing the northern lights. The best time to catch the auroras? Fall through spring, when the nights are longer and geomagnetic activity is strong. When conditions line up, the aurora borealis sweeps across the sky in shades of greens, pinks and purples, as seen in today's image. It occurs when solar particles hit the Earth's magnetic field, creating light that flickers across the atmosphere. A clear sky and a bit of patience can turn an ordinary night into something unforgettable.",

This year's theme is 'Wildlife Conservation Finance: Investing in People and Planet.' The events emphasise exchanging ideas, presenting solutions and diving into how innovative finance can help stop biodiversity loss and create a more sustainable future. Schools, conservation groups and wildlife parks host events such as nature walks, workshops, art contests, wildlife photography competitions and conservation talks to raise awareness.\nOne species worth learning about is the southern yellow-billed hornbill, pictured here, a bird found throughout Southern Africa and commonly spotted in Kruger National Park in South Africa. Recognisable by its bright yellow, curved bill, this bird is often seen hopping on the ground in search of food. Its diet includes insects, seeds, fruits, berries, nuts and small reptiles, making it a key player in the ecosystem as both a predator and seed disperser. Social creatures, these hornbills are usually found in pairs or small groups, often foraging together. Their calls—whistling, grunting and cackling—echo across the savannah.",

Rooted in ancient Roman celebrations like Saturnalia, Mardi Gras evolved as Christianity spread, blending local customs—most notably Carnival festivities—with religious observances.\nNew Orleans is synonymous with Mardi Gras, a tradition celebrated with parades, music and revelry since 1699. Jackson Square in the French Quarter, featured in today's image, stands as a witness to these lively events. Built in the early 1800s, it remains a central spot for visitors to experience the energy of Mardi Gras.\nWhile the warm, bustling parades of New Orleans steal the spotlight, Canada has its own take on Mardi Gras, especially in Quebec. The Quebec City Carnival, held annually from late January to mid-February since 1894, is the largest winter festival in the Western Hemisphere. Snow sculptures, ice canoe races and brightly lit parades are the scene, with participants dressed in bold costumes, making it a true feast for the eyes. Montreal, Ottawa and even smaller cities embrace the festive spirit with lively parties, dance events and family-friendly activities.",

Over time, the lake transformed the landscape into something you'd think was straight out of a movie, as featured in today's image. The dam, originally known as the 'Cheow Lan Project,' was later renamed Rajjaprabha, meaning 'light of the kingdom,' a tribute to King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who ruled from 1946 to 2016.

First observed in the early 1900s, the day traces its roots to labour movements led by women fighting for better pay, improved working conditions and voting rights. From its humble beginnings in 1911, when over a million people attended rallies in Europe, the day has grown into a worldwide movement. Today, it's marked by events, protests and campaigns addressing issues like gender pay gaps, domestic violence and access to education.

Daylight saving time (DST) starts today at 2 AM, reminding us that time, quite literally, waits for no one. The idea is simple: maximising daylight and reducing energy consumption by syncing our activities with the natural light cycle. This concept was popularised by Benjamin Franklin in the 18th century, though his suggestion to 'save candles' was more satirical than a serious proposal. Fast forward to the early 20th century, and many countries adopted DST to conserve fuel during wartime. Today, DST runs from March to November in around 70 countries, giving us eight months of extended evening light.\nThe clock in today's image—St. Mark's Clock Tower—is in Venice, Italy, where it has been keeping time for over 500 years.

Introduced in 1999 by William Anthony, a Boston University professor, and his wife, Camille, this unofficial holiday encourages everyone to take quality naps. Observed on the Monday after clocks spring forward, it's a reminder that rest is essential for well-being. Research backs it up—short naps boost mood, enhance concentration and sharpen memory. Napping is also linked to lower stress and better heart health. While power naps (20-30 minutes) are ideal for a quick recharge, even a few minutes of shut-eye can help.\nIn Uganda's Queen Elizabeth National Park, some lions take napping to new heights—quite literally. The tree-climbing lions of the Ishasha Sector have a habit of sprawling across the branches of giant fig trees, as seen in today's image.

Over time, it evolved into a residence for nobility, most notably serving as the home of Maximilien de Béthune, Duke of Sully, who was a trusted minister of King Henry IV. The castle played a significant role during the French Wars of Religion from 1562 to 1598 and has witnessed countless moments of intrigue and diplomacy. In 1940, during World War II, the castle wall was hit by shells, creating massive holes, but the framework remained intact.\nToday, after multiple restorations, the castle welcomes visitors eager to uncover its history. It also stands as an example of French Renaissance architecture. Visitors can explore the imposing towers, thick stone walls and the beautiful moat that once protected the castle from invaders. The restored interiors feature authentic furniture and artefacts, offering a window into medieval life. Guided tours provide insights into the castle's role in shaping regional and national history.

This date was chosen because 3, 1 and 4 are the first three significant figures of pi (π) when it is written out. Pi is an irrational number, which means that it can't be written as a fraction. When written out, its decimal representation goes on infinitely without repeating. The oldest attempts to calculate pi date back to ancient Babylon and Egypt, around 1,900 BCE.\nPi Day, however, has more recent origins. In the 1980s, physicist Larry Shaw organised the first celebration, where staff at a San Francisco science museum walked around in circles and then ate the number's delicious homophones: pies. Today's image takes us to Álava, northern Spain. The circular motion of the stars appears above the Dolmen of Sorginetxe, an ancient megalithic monument dating back to 3,000 BCE.

		"description": "In the world of clever hunting, the black heron rules the roost. This bird thrives in shallow, open waters and at the edges of freshwater lakes and ponds. It's also commonly spotted in marshes, rice fields, seasonally flooded grasslands and along riverbanks. At first glance, this feathered genius seems like any other wading bird, with its long legs, slender neck and pointed beak that aid in hunting. But when it hunts, this jet-black African species showcases an extraordinary skill—it takes the shape of an umbrella, as seen in today's image. While fishing, the heron dips its head, extends its wings around its body and forms a shaded canopy.\nThis clever technique is known as canopy feeding. One common theory is that small fish, seeking cover, are attracted to the shade of the heron's wings and swim right into its trap. The shade acts like polarised sunglasses, reducing glare and improving the heron's vision under the water. Additionally, the heron might also be camouflaging itself, which further intensifies the trap for the fish.",

		"description": "With the sun rising higher, the days grow longer, marking the arrival of spring. The spring equinox occurs when the sun crosses the celestial equator, moving from the Southern Hemisphere to the Northern Hemisphere. Traditionally, spring is considered to begin on March 21. However, astronomers and calendar makers now agree that spring officially commences on March 20 across all time zones in North America. This event signals the true start of the season, bringing with it the beauty and symbolism of spring blooms.\nAmong these blooms, narcissus, commonly known as daffodil or jonquil—featured here—stands out as a quintessential symbol of the season. Celebrated for centuries in art and literature, the daffodil carries cultural significance worldwide, symbolising death, renewal and good fortune. As one of England's most cherished plants, the daffodil has been celebrated by many English writers for its cultural and symbolic significance, making it one of the most poetically revered flowers. From John Gower and Shakespeare to William Wordsworth and John Milton, daffodils have inspired countless verses in literary history.",

With over 4,000 known species worldwide, they come in all shapes and sizes, from the tiny New Guinea Amau frog—smaller than a dime—to the large Goliath frog, which can weigh more than 3 kilograms. Some, like the glass frog, are nearly transparent, while others are extremely poisonous. The golden poison frog, for example, carries enough toxin to take down ten humans. And if you think all frogs are swamp-dwellers, meet the desert rain frog, a round little amphibian that survives in dry conditions by absorbing moisture through its skin.\nThis month is the perfect excuse to give them the credit they deserve. Frogs play a crucial role in ecosystems by controlling insect populations and serving as prey for many predators. However, habitat loss, pollution and disease threaten many species. Although the origin of National Frog Month is unclear, conservation groups, educators and zoos have embraced the month to emphasise the need to protect frog populations.

		"description": "Spring has arrived, but Whistler isn't ready to let go of winter just yet! As the snow-capped Whistler and Blackcomb mountains keep their frosty charm, the annual Whistler World Ski & Snowboard Festival (WSSF) takes centre stage. Packed with jaw-dropping ski stunts, exhilarating snowboard competitions and back-to-back entertainment, the festival is a final hurrah for winter sports before the season melts away.\nThis multi-day celebration began in 1996, originally created to extend the winter season and boost tourism. Kicking off today and running until April 13 this year, the festival draws a global crowd of athletes, artists and revellers. A new addition this year is the grand finale of 'The Grind,' a street-style ski and board competition. Competitions like the classic Whistler race and Slush Cup keep adrenaline high, while photography exhibits and art displays offer a creative touch. After sunset, the town comes alive with concerts like the 'Battle of the Bands,' film screenings, cultural events and après-ski parties.",

		"description": "Tucked along the Algarve coast in Portugal is the Benagil Cave, carved by the relentless power of the sea. Called Algar de Benagil in Portuguese, this sea cave, seen in today's image, draws adventurers, photographers and nature enthusiasts from across the world. With its limestone walls, circular skylight and turquoise waters, its inside looks like a natural cathedral.\nBenagil Cave wasn't sculpted overnight—it was formed over millions of years by coastal erosion, shaped mostly by waves, currents and tides. The cave's most distinctive feature is its 'eye,' a natural opening in the ceiling that bathes the interior in sunlight, creating a stunning interplay of light and shadow. The cave is located near Benagil, a quaint Portuguese village on the Atlantic coast in the municipality of Lagoa. Until the late 20th century, Benagil was a traditional fishing village, with its economy deeply rooted in ocean fishing. Over the years, it has transformed into a thriving tourist destination, thanks in part to its stunning beach, Praia de Benagil. The region, including the Benagil Cave, showcases a perfect harmony of nature's wonders and the charm of Portugal's coastline.",

When the sun is positioned well below the horizon, during this brief window, the lingering sunlight casts a deep blue hue across the sky.\nNaxos is renowned for its deposits of emery, a corundum-rich rock that was once among the finest natural abrasives used before modern alternatives emerged. The most fertile island in the Cyclades, it has a reliable water supply in the region. It is celebrated across Greece for its signature flavours, including the rich Arseniko Naxou cheese, flavourful potatoes, aromatic Kitron liqueur made from local citrus and Naxian honey, primarily sourced from thyme nectar. A sun-soaked island, Naxos is packed with beaches, villages and ancient ruins. Whether you're looking to rest on the sands of beaches like Agia Anna, Agios Prokopios or Plaka or chase the wind at one of the island's top windsurfing and kitesurfing spots, there's no shortage of adventure here.",

Siblings Day is here—a day to appreciate the ones who stole your toys, tattled on you and yet somehow remain your biggest supporters. Although Siblings Day is not a federally recognised holiday, it has gained recognition across several countries. The idea came from Claudia Evart, who established the day in memory of her late siblings. Since 1995, the Siblings Day Foundation has worked to celebrate this occasion and the unique connection shared by brothers and sisters.\nSiblinghood isn't just for humans—it's a big deal in the wild too! Red fox cubs, featured in today's image, take sibling rivalry and teamwork to a whole new level. Cubs are born in an underground den, blind and helpless. Their mother keeps them safe while the father brings food. But as their eyes open and legs strengthen, the real fun begins. Sibling play is essential, shaping their hunting and social skills while keeping things entertaining. Wrestling, pouncing and even playful ambushes are all part of the training. They mimic each other's behaviours, test their boundaries and develop their cunning instincts as a team. So, this Siblings Day, take a lesson from these animals—embrace the chaos, enjoy the fun and maybe let your sibling have the last snack—just this once.",

		"description": "From the famous tulip fields to the world's largest flower auction, the Netherlands and tulips go a long way back. Interestingly, tulips didn't originate here. These beauties arrived in the country in the late 16th century, brought from the Ottoman Empire. By the 17th century, they became so valuable that a single bulb could cost more than a house. This period, known as 'tulip mania,' is considered one of the first recorded financial bubbles. When prices crashed in 1637, fortunes were lost, but the love for tulips remained.\nThe most famous tulip fields, like the one pictured here, are found in regions such as the Bollenstreek (Bulb Region), just outside Amsterdam. Rows of red, yellow, pink and purple stretch as far as the eye can see. Then there's Keukenhof, in Lisse, the world's most famous flower park, open only for a few weeks each spring. It showcases over seven million bulbs, including rare and exotic tulip varieties. The designs change every year, so no two visits are ever the same. If you miss the bloom, don't worry—the Netherlands keeps its tulip industry thriving year-round. The Dutch take their tulips seriously, and nowhere is this more evident than at the Aalsmeer Flower Auction, the largest flower market in the world. Here, millions of flowers, including tulips, are bought and sold daily, making their way to homes across the globe.",

Then, on April 12, 1961, one man left the planet and changed history forever. That morning, Soviet pilot Yuri Gagarin climbed into a small, spherical spacecraft named Vostok 1. The countdown began. The engines ignited. As the rocket roared toward the sky, he called out, 'Poyekhali!'—'Let's go!' And just like that, Earth had its first space traveller.\nFor 108 minutes, Gagarin orbited the planet, watching the world from a view no human had ever seen before. When he landed safely back on Earth, everything had changed. Humanity had entered the Space Age. His flight sparked the race to the Moon, the dream of living on Mars and much more. Decades later, in honour of his achievement, the United Nations declared April 12 as the International Day of Human Space Flight. Pictured here is the view from the cupola of the International Space Station, showing the vast South Pacific Ocean. It is a reminder of how small Earth is in the grand cosmos—and how far human spaceflight has taken us.",

Thailand's Songkran festival is a unique mix of spiritual traditions and all-out water fights. Held from April 13 to 15 this year, the holiday is deeply rooted in Buddhist customs and focuses on cleansing and starting afresh. During this time, people visit temples, offer food to monks and pour scented water over Buddha statues and elders' hands as a sign of respect. Meanwhile, the streets turn into water battlegrounds, with locals and tourists alike getting soaked in the spirit of renewal. Traditional parades roll through the lanes, and in some places, the 'Lady Songkran' or 'Miss Songkran' contest steals the show, with contestants dressed in stunning Thai outfits.\nThose seeking a calmer way to celebrate might consider visiting Wat Tang Sai Temple in Ban Krut, seen in today's image. Perched on Thong Chai Mountain, this temple complex is home to a 13-metre-tall Buddha statue and Thai-style pagodas. Built in 1996 to honour King Bhumibol Adulyadej (Rama IX) on his 50th year of reign (1946–2016), it remains an important spiritual site.

Found mainly in warm, temperate waters of the Atlantic Ocean, these dolphins are known for their unique spotted patterns, which become more visible as they age.\nJuveniles start with a plain grey body, but as they mature, spots cover their skin, making each dolphin's pattern entirely unique. From leaping through waves to chatting in clicks and whistles, dolphins are all about social life. They often travel in pods and love to check out passing boats whenever they get the chance. You'll find them in the warm temperate and tropical waters of the Atlantic, hunting fish in coordinated groups. Santa Maria Island, part of Portugal's Azores archipelago, is a popular spot to witness these dolphins in action. Their speed and agility make them efficient hunters—and a thrill to watch.

Shaped by the relentless forces of wind and water, this monument features three magnificent natural bridges—Sipapu, Kachina and Owachomo. These bridges were named to honour the Ancestral Puebloans who once lived here. Sipapu is the largest bridge, with a massive opening that could almost fit the dome of the United States Capitol. Kachina, pictured here, is equidistant from Sipapu and Owachomo. It was named after the petroglyphs and pictographs found at its base. Owachomo is believed to be the oldest of the three. Its thin, arching structure suggests it may eventually collapse.

They look like they're wearing a bright orange-red costume, complete with a huge crest that almost covers their beak. With its bold colours, this native South American bird isn't just about looks—it's got the moves too.\nThe Andean and Guianan cock-of-the-rock are renowned for their theatrical courtship dances, making them true head-turners of the feathered kingdom. Females are far less flashy, with brownish feathers that help them stay hidden. During the mating season, males gather in leks—noisy display arenas—where they hop, squawk and shake their heads in an effort to impress a female. She watches, picks the best dancer, mates and then flies off to build a concave, cup-shaped mud nest on a rocky surface. The female typically lays two white eggs and incubates them for 25 to 28 days, raising the chicks on her own. The Andean cock-of-the-rock thrives in the cloud forests of the Andes, favouring dense, fruit-rich areas in Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia. As a frugivore, it primarily eats fruit and helps spread seeds throughout its habitat. It occasionally consumes insects and small vertebrates.",

Today, the river continues to carve through the landscape, creating canyons that attract hikers and climbers.\nThe park's highest point, Horse Ranch Mountain, stands at 2,660 metres, while the lowest, Coalpits Wash, sits at 1,117 metres. Trails lead visitors from riverbanks to ridgelines. Angels Landing is one of Zion's famous hikes, offering a steep climb and breathtaking views. Observation Point, a longer but less exposed trek, sits even higher, overlooking Zion Canyon. For those who prefer a more relaxed route, the Emerald Pools Trail offers waterfalls, lush vegetation and shaded pathways. This national park has a diverse plant and animal life. It is home to 289 bird, 79 mammal, 28 reptile, 7 fish and 6 amphibian species. Flora ranges from towering ponderosa pines to delicate hanging gardens clinging to the canyon walls.

Born in 1564, Shakespeare revolutionised English literature with unforgettable works like 'Hamlet,' 'Macbeth' and 'Romeo and Juliet.' Even four centuries after his death, his influence remains undeniable—his stories continue to captivate, challenge and inspire.\nWith today's image, we can step inside Shakespeare's Globe Theatre in London, a faithful reconstruction of the original 1599 theatre, where the Bard's plays once thrilled Elizabethan audiences. The original Globe, built by Shakespeare's acting company, the Lord Chamberlain's Men, was tragically destroyed by fire in 1613 when a cannon misfired during a performance of 'Henry VIII.' The modern Globe was designed to replicate the authentic 17th-century experience.

More than half of its terrain is blanketed in ice, with glaciers dominating 51% of its area. Throughout the 20th century, the park's glaciers have receded, uncovering new land for plant and animal life to take root. From ancient Sitka spruces to delicate fireweed shoots and lush moss carpeting the forest floor, plant life in Kenai Fjords flourishes despite the rugged terrain. The park is also home to diverse terrestrial and marine mammals, including timber wolves, porcupines, Canadian lynxes and cetaceans like orcas and fin whales. It also hosts a variety of birds, such as bald eagles and Peale's peregrine falcons.\nKenai Fjords isn't just about stunning landscapes and flourishing wilderness—it's also a place rich with human history. For thousands of years, Alaska Natives have called this region home, leaving behind traces of their lives in the land. Within the national park, the past still lingers—from Sugpiaq camps, an Alaska Native group, once scattered along the coastline to the remnants of old mining camps in Nuka Bay. These historical footprints are just as precious as the park's natural wonders, offering a vital connection to the people who shaped this land. With so much to explore, it's no wonder Kenai Fjords is one of the most-visited parks in the state.",

A species native to South America's coastal regions, these birds breed along Patagonia's shores in Argentina, Chile and the Falkland Islands. Named after Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan, these medium-sized penguins were first documented in 1520. They can grow up to 76 centimetres tall and weigh around 6 kilograms. Skilled hunters, they thrive on a diet of small fish, squid and krill, efficiently filtering seawater with their specialised salt-excreting glands.

Designated in 1987, it safeguards a landscape of towering limestone cliffs, hidden caves, dense forests and untouched shorelines. As part of a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, it's a haven for species that have adapted to its rugged terrain, like black bears, massasauga rattlesnakes and white-tailed deer.\nWith a network of trails—including the long Cyprus Lake Trail and Bruce Trail—hikers can wind through thick woodlands, discover karst formations, cobblestone beaches and quiet meadows. As you wander deep into the park, nature reveals a quiet yet stunning display. The eastern prairie fringed orchid brightens the trails, and ancient cedar trees cling to the rocky edges, seemingly defying gravity. Then there's the famed Grotto, situated on the shore between the Marr Lake and Georgian Bay trails. This stunning limestone cave, with its glowing blue waters, is worth every step of the hike. Whether you're here for the views, the wildlife or a refreshing dip in Georgian Bay, this park offers an unforgettable escape.",

The redwood groves of Redwood National and State Parks (RNSP) in California, United States, are home to some of the tallest trees on Earth, soaring over 113 metres high. The combined RNSP contain Redwood National Park, Del Norte Coast Redwoods State Park, Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park and Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park. Some of these redwoods were alive when the Mayans built their temples, and the Great Wall of China was under construction. Protected since 1968, the park preserves nearly half of the world's remaining old-growth redwoods.\nIf you are visiting, you might want to walk through Stout Grove in Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park or Lady Bird Johnson Grove in Redwood National Park for a quiet stroll among the redwoods. You can also hike the Tall Trees Trail, a permit-only path where you can closely witness the tallest trees. The RNSP ecosystem is home to many animals, including Roosevelt elk, black bears, banana slugs and the endangered marbled murrelets. Ferns and moss thrive beneath the leafy canopy, while coastal fog provides essential moisture to the trees. Whether hiking beneath these towering giants or simply standing in their shadows, the experience is humbling.",

Moremi Game Reserve stretches across the eastern side of Botswana's Okavango Delta, covering 4,921 square kilometres. Established in 1963, it became Africa's first reserve created by local people—the Batawana, a Bantu ethnic group native to Southern Africa—to protect the region's wildlife from uncontrolled hunting. The combination of permanent water and dry land makes it one of the best places in Africa to observe wildlife in its natural habitat.\nOne animal you're almost certain to spot is the impala. These medium-sized antelopes are active mainly during the day. Males fight fiercely for dominance during the breeding season, or rut, locking horns in dramatic battles. After a six-month gestation period, females give birth to a single fawn. Outside the mating season, they stick together in herds—the territorial males, bachelor herds and female herds—always on the lookout for predators. When danger strikes, they freeze, only to explode into a sprint when the moment demands. They can leap up to 3 metres high, cover nearly 9 metres in a single bound and change direction mid-sprint. Whether grazing quietly or launching into a sudden dash, impalas are among Moremi's most adaptable residents.",

While the Loire Valley in France is packed with stunning châteaux (French for castles), Villandry stands apart, not for its towering turrets or medieval might, but for its gardens. Built in the 16th century by Jean le Breton, a minister to King Francis I, Villandry was always meant to impress. Unlike fortified castles built for war, it was designed for comfort, featuring large windows and an open, welcoming layout. Its gardens are arranged across terraces with distinct themes. The ornamental garden showcases geometric patterns like the one pictured here. The water garden offers a serene retreat, and the vegetable garden turns everyday crops into artistic displays.\nAfter a challenging period, the dilapidated Château de Villandry was purchased in 1906 by Spanish doctor Joachim Carvallo and his wife, Ann Coleman, an heiress to an American steel empire. Their passion for history and horticulture led to a full restoration, and their descendants continue to maintain the estate today. These gardens change with the seasons, ensuring that no two visits are exactly alike. Whether you have a green thumb or not, it's hard not to admire the precision at play.",

Rooted in blues and ragtime, jazz quickly evolved, with pioneers like Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald giving it a voice. Canada embraced jazz early on, with Montreal becoming a jazz hotspot by the 1920s. The Montreal International Jazz Festival, founded in 1980, holds a Guinness World Record as the world's largest jazz festival, drawing global artists and fans.\nToday, jazz is everywhere—from Brazilian bossa nova to Ethiopian Ethio-jazz, proving that a good groove knows no borders.

On May 1, Hawaii celebrates Lei Day, a tradition that honours culture, craftsmanship and the ever-present aloha spirit, described as 'the coordination of mind and heart within each person.' Since 1928, this Hawaiian tradition has been in full bloom, with leis—or garlands made of flowers, leaves or shells—serving as symbols of connection. The idea for Lei Day came from poet Don Blanding, who suggested a holiday dedicated to Hawaii's iconic floral garlands. Local writer Grace Tower Warren gave it its slogan, 'May Day is Lei Day in Hawaii,' and the tradition quickly took root.\nWhat started as a single event in Honolulu has grown into a statewide celebration, with each island showcasing its unique floral identity, such as Maui's pink lokelani rose and the Big Island's red 'ōhi'a lehua. Giving a lei is a gesture of aloha, and on this day, that warmth can be seen everywhere. Whether crafted from fragrant Plumeria flowers, like the ones pictured here, delicate pikake or colourful ti leaves, leis symbolise the bonds between people and the land. So, if you find yourself in Hawaii, don't just say 'Aloha'—wear it.",

This is Namibia—a surreal landscape of towering dunes, dry riverbeds and shifting sands.\nUnlike traditional aircraft, ultralights offer an unmatched sense of freedom. Also known as microlights, these small planes are designed for low-altitude, slow-speed flying. Their weight and speed limits vary by country; in Canada, ultralights fall into two main categories: basic (up to 544 kilograms, usually single-seat) and advanced (up to 560 kilograms, two-seat max). They must meet specific Transport Canada safety standards.\nThese ultralights typically cruise between 100–150 kilometres per hour—ideal for low, scenic flights. Some can even go a bit faster, depending on the model. With open or semi-enclosed cockpits, ultralights provide breathtaking panoramic views, making each flight an immersive experience. Ultralight aviation took off in Canada in the late 1970s, revolutionising recreational flying. With minimal regulations and lightweight design, these aircraft offer an accessible and exhilarating way to explore some of the world's most remote and beautiful places, like the one we see in today's image.",

Built in the 13th century, this castle in County Antrim, Northern Ireland, was once a stronghold of the MacDonnells of Antrim, a branch of the Clan MacDonnell that played a key role in Irish politics from the 15th to the 17th century. The family's fortunes declined after the Battle of the Boyne in 1690, and with little money for upkeep, the castle gradually fell into ruin.\nDunluce Castle is steeped in legend, including the tale of its banshee. Maeve Roe, the only daughter of Lord MacQuillan, defied an arranged marriage and was locked away in the castle's turret. One night, as Maeve Roe and her lover fled by boat, a fierce storm struck, dragging them both to a watery grave. Locals say her ghostly cries still echo from the turret. Today, visitors can explore the windswept remains of this medieval fortress, imagining the feasts and battles that once took place here.

World Donkey Day, established by Dr. Abdul Raziq Kakar, a livestock expert from Pakistan, is all about celebrating these hardworking animals. Donkeys have a reputation for being stubborn, but that's just a misunderstanding. They're actually cautious thinkers. Unlike horses, which might bolt at danger, donkeys take a moment to assess the situation before reacting. From ancient trade routes to modern farms, donkeys have been essential to transportation and agriculture. In many parts of the world, they're still the backbone of rural economies, carrying supplies across difficult terrain where vehicles can't go. Despite their vital role, donkeys face serious challenges. Many endure overwork, poor treatment and abandonment.\nSpanish explorers introduced donkeys, or burros, to North America in the 1500s. Donkeys made their way to Canada through European settlers, and while they're not as common here as in warmer climates, they've found a special place in hearts and hobby farms across the country. If you're in Ontario, today is a great excuse to visit The Donkey Sanctuary of Canada in Guelph, where over 100 rescued donkeys and mules live out their days in peace. Over in British Columbia, the Turtle Valley Donkey Refuge near Chase offers visitors a chance to meet these gentle animals up close and learn about their care. Whether pulling carts, working in therapy programs or just being adorable, these creatures deserve more appreciation. So, let's give them their due—and maybe even a bray of applause.",

Today, there are more than 3,000 registered varieties of tulips grown around the world. Originally found in the wild across Central Asia, tulips were cultivated by the Ottomans as early as the 10th century. These flowers made their way into Europe during the 16th century after being introduced through diplomatic and trade routes. By the 1630s, the Netherlands experienced tulip mania, one of the first recorded economic bubbles, where single bulbs could sell for more than a skilled worker's annual salary.\nYou wouldn't expect a wartime thank-you to spark a flower festival, but that's exactly what happened in Ottawa. In the late 1940s, Queen Juliana of the Netherlands sent 100,000 tulips to Canada as a gesture of gratitude for sheltering the Dutch royal family during WWII. That gift grew into a national celebration, and by 1953, Ottawa had launched the Canadian Tulip Festival. Since then, the city has embraced tulip season with floral displays, cultural exhibits and public events each May. But it's not just about flowers—the festival has a musical history too. In 1972, Liberace kicked things off with a concert. Alanis Morissette got her start here at just 12 years old in 1987, and The Trews caught their big break in 2003. Princess Margriet of the Netherlands even returned for the 50th anniversary in 2002. Today, the festival features over a million tulips, plus food markets, heritage installations and scenic walking routes along the Rideau Canal.",

Designed in the Beaux-Arts and American Renaissance styles, the Capitol integrates modern materials like iron, glass and steel. The term 'Beaux-Arts' was not used when the Capitol was built, but the style gained popularity, partly due to the architecture showcased at the 1893 Chicago World's Columbian Exposition. Architect Cass Gilbert's design features a remarkable dome, which is inspired by St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican City. Featured in today's image, it is the second-largest self-supported marble dome in the world.\nThis dome is built in three layers, each serving a different purpose. The outermost layer, made of Georgia marble, holds itself up by sheer weight alone. Inside, a brick-and-steel cone adds support and helps drain water to withstand Minnesota's harsh winters.

Mother's Day is a time to honour the women who shape our lives, celebrating motherhood, unbreakable bonds and their lasting impact on society. While the modern American version of this holiday began in the early 20th century, the celebration of motherhood has existed for centuries across cultures. Social activist Anna Jarvis led the inaugural Mother's Day worship service in 1908 at Andrews Methodist Episcopal Church in Grafton, West Virginia, now home to the International Mother's Day Shrine.\nPerfectly capturing a touching moment of motherhood in the wild, today's image features a leopard mother and her cub. This bond extends beyond infancy, as mothers continue to nurture and support their young even after weaning. Leopard mothers share territory with their cubs, providing protection and guidance as they grow. At around nine weeks, cubs begin eating meat and by three months they start joining hunts, learning essential survival skills. By their first year, they can fend for themselves, but they typically stay with their mother for up to two years before venturing out on their own. In times of scarcity, mothers have been known to share their kills, ensuring their cubs remain nourished and strong. Their relationship embodies the essence of motherhood—teaching, protecting and preparing the next generation for life ahead.",

		"description": "Most ports rely on docks and cranes that extend into the shoreline. Porto Flavia in the Sulcis-Iglesiente region, however, took a completely different approach. This engineering marvel transformed a cliff into a gateway for Sardinia's ore industry. Mining in Sulcis-Iglesiente has a history dating back thousands of years, from the Phoenicians and Romans to the industrial boom in the 20th century. Lead, zinc, coal, sulphur, barium and silver were extracted from these rugged hills but transporting them was a logistical nightmare. Ore had to be hauled by cart, loaded onto small boats and then transferred to larger ships—a slow, costly and inefficient process.\nIn 1924, Italian engineer Cesare Vecelli revolutionised ore transport in the region. He designed Porto Flavia as a system of tunnels and silos carved into a limestone cliff, allowing ore to be loaded directly onto cargo ships. The facility featured two stacked tunnel levels. The upper level could store up to 11,000 short tons of ore in nine reservoirs. Gravity-fed chutes transported the ore to the lower level, where a conveyor belt loaded it directly onto waiting ships. The port, named after Vecelli's daughter, Flavia, remained in use until mining declined in the mid-20th century. Today, visitors can explore its tunnels, massive silos and the platform where ships once docked—soaking in the same sea breeze that once carried Sardinia's minerals to markets worldwide.",

		"description": "London's most famous clock tower isn't called Big Ben—that name belongs to the massive 12,000 kilograms bell inside. It has marked time for Londoners since 1859, ringing from what is now known as the Elizabeth Tower. In 2012, officials renamed the Clock Tower to Elizabeth Tower to honour Queen Elizabeth II during her Diamond Jubilee. The clock has stopped only for maintenance and rare disruptions, such as bomb damage during World Wars I and II. Each of its four clock faces spans more than 6 metres, with the minute hands measuring roughly 4 metres. At 90 metres tall, the tower is part of the grand Palace of Westminster, home to the UK Parliament.\nFor centuries, the Palace of Westminster has stood at the heart of British politics. Originally built by Edward the Confessor in the 11th century, the palace has hosted Parliament since the 13th century. Previously a royal residence, it remained one until a fire in 1512 forced Henry VIII to relocate. A second devastating fire in 1834 destroyed most of the medieval complex, leading to the Gothic Revival design seen today. Architect Charles Barry led the reconstruction, while his assistant, Augustus Pugin, designed the intricate details. Covering over 112,476 sq metres, the palace houses the House of Commons, the House of Lords and Westminster Hall, which dates back to 1097.",

Spanning over 550 square kilometres, this lagoon is a rich mosaic of islands, mudflats, canals and marshes, and it's one of the largest wetlands in the entire Mediterranean Basin. The lagoon isn't just a scenic wonder—it's a place steeped in history and innovation. Formed after the last Ice Age, it became a refuge for people fleeing invasions around the time of the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 CE. In the centuries that followed, those early settlers began building what would eventually become the iconic city of Venice.\nToday, the lagoon is still central to local life, supporting fishing, tourism and even sustainable aquaculture. It's connected to the Adriatic Sea by three inlets and is famous for 'acqua alta,' or 'high water,' when tides flood parts of Venice. From ancient refuge to modern marvel, the Venetian Lagoon is a reflection of how people and nature can shape a place together.",

This stunning artwork was created for the Pavilion of Light and Electricity at the 1937 International Exhibition of Art and Technology in Modern Life. The painting was inspired by the poem 'On the Nature of Things,' written by the Roman poet and philosopher Lucretius. Raoul Dufy's work vividly depicts the evolution of electricity through two main themes: the history of electricity and its applications.\nInternational Museum Day, celebrated annually on May 18, aims to raise awareness about the importance of museums in cultural exchange, enrichment and mutual understanding. Since its inception in 1977, the event has grown to include over 37,000 museums across 158 countries.

Officially recognised as a holiday in the mid-19th century, it's a nod to the country's colonial roots and a reminder of the queen's lasting influence. It's more than just a long weekend; for many, it marks the unofficial start of summer, with parades, picnics and festivities across the country, particularly in British Columbia.\nThe British Columbia Parliament Buildings in Victoria often play a central role in the celebrations. Designed by architect Francis Rattenbury when he was just 25, the buildings opened in 1898 and still house the Legislative Assembly. Rattenbury's winning design, chosen through a public competition, gave the province's government a more imposing and formal presence. On Victoria Day, the buildings light up—literally—serving as a tribute to the monarch who gave the city its name.",

Alongside butterflies, bats and hummingbirds, bees pollinate nearly 90% of the world's wild flowering plants and over 35% of the food crops we rely on. World Bee Day, marked every May 20, honours these vital pollinators and celebrates Anton Janša, a pioneer of modern beekeeping. Janša saw bees as the noblest of insects, an idea now backed by science.\nUnfortunately, bee populations are in danger. Pesticide exposure, habitat loss and climate change are driving their numbers down, threatening both global food security and biodiversity. The good news is that small actions can make a big difference. Support local beekeepers, plant pollinator-friendly flowers and avoid chemical pesticides. And the next time you stir honey into your tea, remember the tiny worker behind that golden spoonful and why protecting this buzzing species matters more than ever.",

Today is International Tea Day, a global nod to this timeless beverage, established by the United Nations to recognise tea's role in reducing poverty and supporting sustainable development. It's a day to honour both the drink and the people who are part of this industry.\nTea harvesting is a delicate craft, rooted in tradition and influenced by geography. From the misty hills of Zhejiang province in China, pictured here, to the rolling estates of Assam in India, the process differs. Green tea leaves are sun-dried or steamed to preserve their freshness, while oolong and black teas undergo oxidation to develop complex, bold flavours. The result is a rich spectrum of taste, colour and aroma. China, India, Kenya and Sri Lanka lead global tea production. Each country offers its own signature style: China with pu-erh and green teas, India with robust black blends, Kenya with CTC teas and Sri Lanka with floral Ceylon. Canadians drink roughly 11.6 billion cups of tea per year, which averages 326 cups per person. In every cup, you can taste the story of its origin, shaped by the land's soil, altitude and climate.",

All tortoises are turtles, but not all turtles are tortoises. While turtles are smaller and built for swimming, tortoises are larger, heavier and adapted for life on land. The American Tortoise Rescue (ATR) established World Turtle Day to raise awareness and protection efforts on May 23 each year. ATR has helped rehabilitate, rescue and rehome around 4,000 turtles and tortoises, working to protect them and their disappearing habitats.\nHere we see a fascinating Amazonian phenomenon—a Julia butterfly on the nose of a yellow-spotted river turtle in Ecuador's Amazon River region. Butterflies in the Amazon are known to sip the tears of turtles, which provide a vital source of sodium, a mineral in short supply. The yellow-spotted river turtle is one of the largest river turtles in South America. While these turtles are well-adapted to the waters, they face a range of threats from humans, birds, snakes, large fish, frogs and mammals. Though the yellow-spotted river turtle is not native to Canada, its distant relatives are. It is home to eight species of freshwater turtles and four species of sea turtles. Species like the painted turtle and the endangered Blanding's turtle are protected under conservation regulations.",

It is home to the country's highest peaks, including Galdhøpiggen, the highest in Northern Europe at 2,470 metres. The name 'Jotunheimen' translates to 'Home of the Giants,' a nod to its dramatic terrain and Norse mythology. The park shelters red foxes, Arctic foxes, lemmings and red deer, while its flora includes hardy alpine species adapted to extreme conditions. Flowing through the park, the Gjende lake is famous for its striking green colour, caused by glacial sediments. Stretching about 18 kilometres in length and less than 1.6 kilometres at its widest point, the lake sits at around 1,000 metres above sea level.

But it doesn't have to be that way. On World Otter Day—the last Wednesday of May—let's shine a light on the challenges these lovable mammals face and help protect their place in the wild.\nOtters belong to the Mustelidae family, a diverse group that includes weasels, badgers and minks, and are found on every continent except Australia and Antarctica. With 13 species worldwide, including the European otter, giant otter and sea otter—pictured here—these semi-aquatic animals are adapted for life in water. Their webbed feet, dense fur and strong tails make them excellent swimmers. Beyond their cuteness, otters play a vital role in ecosystems. As top predators in freshwater and coastal habitats, they help maintain healthy fish populations and keep aquatic environments balanced. Without otters, food chains could become unstable, leading to ecological problems.

On June 1, we celebrate World Reef Awareness Day, a time to recognise the beauty—and fragility—of coral reef ecosystems. One magnificent example is the New Caledonian barrier reef, which wraps around Grande Terre, New Caledonia's largest island. At over 1,400 kilometres long, it's the longest continuous barrier reef in the world.\nGlass sponges form rare and remarkable ecosystems found only in select parts of the world. In British Columbia, these reefs thrive in areas like Hecate Strait, Queen Charlotte Sound, the Strait of Georgia and Howe Sound—often at depths of 90 to 300 metres, though in Howe Sound they appear as shallow as 22 metres. These towering underwater structures can stretch across hundreds of square kilometres and reach heights of up to 25 metres, creating vital habitats deep beneath the waves.",

		"description": "It is easy to call a place remote. It's harder to understand what that really means—until you stand on Fogo Island in Newfoundland and Labrador. With just over 2,000 residents spread across 11 tight-knit outports, life here moves to its own rhythm. From Tilting to Joe Batt's Arm, these settlements were founded by Irish and English fishers centuries ago. The traditions they introduced can still be witnessed in the island festivals like mummering in winter, boat launches in summer and kitchen parties year-round. Fishing was the backbone for generations, and even now, the sea's pulse is never far off.\nWhat sets Fogo apart isn't just its setting—it’s how its people responded to change. When the cod fishery collapsed in the 1990s, they didn't leave. Instead, they built something new. The Shorefast Foundation, led by Zita Cobb, helped turn the island into a model for place-based sustainability. The Fogo Island Inn became a symbol of that shift, designed by Newfoundland-born architect Todd Saunders and built by local hands. The island is a place where the past is not polished—it is lived.",

		"description": "Two wheels, no fuel and a whole lot of purpose—cycling is affordable, eco-friendly and easy on the planet. Something as simple as cycling can significantly boost your health, and swapping the car for a bicycle is an easy way to stay active. Moreover, cycling helps reduce pollution, eases traffic congestion and offers an affordable transport option for those without access to cars. Because of all these benefits, the United Nations dedicated June 3 as World Bicycle Day—a day to celebrate everything this amazing two-wheeler stands for. If there's one place that brings the cycling spirit to life, it's the Netherlands. Today's image captures bicycles lined up on a bridge in Utrecht. More than half the journeys around the city happen on bikes, surpassing cars and other transport options.\nNearly everyone lives within 15 minutes of essentials—and over 90% can reach key places in just 10. This wasn't always the case. It was only in the 1970s, sparked by an oil crisis, rising car-related issues and strong social movements, that the country started prioritising bikes over cars. Cycling in Canada takes many forms, from daily commutes to school or work to recreational rides and competitive sports like mountain biking, BMX and road racing. Infrastructure quality and cycling laws—such as helmet rules—vary by province. Advocacy efforts and improved urban infrastructure have boosted the popularity of bike commuting. Across this vast and diverse country, the perception of safety and access to cycling-friendly spaces significantly influences how often Canadians choose to ride, whether for necessity, sport or leisure.",

This island has a coastline that stretches over 1,700 kilometres. While natural rivers are few, with Tirso being the longest, Sardinia has embraced innovation with 54 artificial lakes and dams. Among the most significant are Lake Omodeo and Lake Coghinas, key sources of water and electricity for the region.\nOn the island's eastern coast lies Cala Luna, featured here—a beach in the Gulf of Orosei. Rising at the mouth of Rio Illune, this beach is at the end of the Codula di Luna canyon. It is a haven of golden sand, surrounded by white cliffs that rise more than 250 metres into the sky—perfect for rock climbing. Here, the waters are shallow at first, before deepening into crystal-clear depths ideal for snorkelling, diving and fishing. In the local Nuoro dialect, the word for 'Luna,' meaning 'moon', is rendered as 'elune,' a name that perfectly captures the essence of this enchanting cove. Adding to the mystique, the beach's crescent shape echoes its lunar inspiration. For centuries, shepherds from the village of Baunei would embark on an eight-hour walk to reach this secluded spot, considering it a journey as far as the moon itself.",

The over 350-square-metre artwork is made of 400,000 bottle caps and depicts two blue macaws spreading their wings across a once-plain cement wall. Children, seniors and everyone in between rolled up their sleeves to glue caps, piece by piece, converting waste into something meaningful. Through this project, Olivares not only crafted something beautiful, but also sparked conversations about sustainability and showed people the power of collective action.

On June 6, 1944, over 156,000 Allied troops landed on the beaches of Normandy, France, launching Operation Overlord, also known as D-Day. This complex assault, involving coordinated air, sea and land forces, marked the beginning of the campaign to liberate Western Europe from Nazi control.\nOne of the key sites was Arromanches-les-Bains, pictured here. Though not among the initial landing beaches, this quiet coastal town became vital in the days that followed. It was here that the Allies built Mulberry harbour B, a massive, temporary port assembled in record time to offload troops, vehicles and supplies. In the months after D-Day, more than 2.5 million men and 500,000 vehicles landed at Arromanches. Remnants of the harbour still lie offshore, a symbol of the ingenuity and planning behind the operation. Arromanches is also home to the Musée du Débarquement, the first museum dedicated to D-Day and the Battle of Normandy, a place where history lives on through stories of courage and resilience.",

These marine mammals are heavy—females average 263 kilograms, while males are around 544 kilograms. Males are noticeably larger than females and are known for their loud roars, thick necks and flatter snouts. Their deep vocalisations include belching, growling and snorting to warn others and communicate underwater. Males get loud to defend turf, while moms and pups use unique calls to find each other in a crowded rookery. Despite their size, they're preyed on by orcas and large sharks.

Once known as the independent Republic of Ragusa, this city was a major maritime power and trading hub from the 14th to the 19th century. Situated in southern Dalmatia along the Adriatic Sea, its success was built on diplomacy and seafaring. The Walls of Dubrovnik, built between the 13th and 17th centuries, stretch for 1,940 metres, with towers, forts and bastions still standing strong. The current layout of the walls follows a city plan from 1292, when Dubrovnik was rebuilt after a fire under Venetian rule.\nInside these walls is the Old City—a compact grid of polished limestone streets, baroque churches and centuries-old residences. Everything here, including the 15th-century Rector's Palace, Sponza Palace and the Church of St. Blaise, reflects the city's independent past. The Franciscan Monastery, Europe's oldest still operating pharmacy, adds another layer of charm to this vintage place. Dubrovnik might seem familiar. That's because it has represented the cities of King's Landing and Qarth in 'Game of Thrones,' putting it on the pop culture map. It's not just a touristy location—it's a city that has been writing its own script for over a thousand years.",

Flamingos feed on algae, crustaceans and tiny invertebrates packed with carotenoids—the same pigments that make carrots orange. The more they eat, the pinker they get. In other words, they're what they eat, right down to the blush. In the air, flamingos are sleek flyers, cruising long distances in a V-formation.

In 1907, Grace Clayton, who lost her father in the Monongah mining disaster in West Virginia, United States, suggested a service to honour fathers who died in the incident. Although the idea didn't gain traction initially, it was revived in 1909 by Sonora Smart Dodd of Spokane, Washington, United States. She sought to pay tribute to her father, a Civil War veteran who raised six children alone. Her determination sparked a movement, laying the foundation for the day we now dedicate to dads.\nIn the spirit of Father's Day, featured here is a lesser male rhea, also known as Darwin's rhea, with his chicks in the Torres del Paine National Park, Patagonia, Chile. A male lesser rhea mates with several females and leads them to a shared nest, where they lay eggs in succession before leaving and returning periodically to add more. From the moment his chicks hatch, the male lesser rhea takes full charge—guiding them through the brush, communicating with gentle whistles and sheltering them under his wings in times of danger or cold. Remarkably, he often adopts lost chicks, raising a mixed-age brood. For nearly six months, he teaches and protects them, with many staying close until maturity.

Most of them are either endangered or vulnerable. These creatures often mistake floating plastic for jellyfish and eat it; fishing nets unintentionally trap and drown them; and rising temperatures are making most hatchlings female, which has a negative impact on biodiversity. So today, lend a hand to a turtle—or better yet, keep plastic out of the ocean.

The trees here stand their ground. Live oaks bend but don't break. Saw palmettos crowd the ground like leafy bodyguards, while Spanish moss hangs from branches like nature's fringe. This maritime forest is one of the best remaining examples of this rare habitat in the United States. Thanks to its national seashore status, the island has been spared from the concrete creep seen on other coastlines.\nWhat you see here is the forest as it's been for centuries—a few ruins from the days of Scottish- American industrialist Thomas Carnegie and the occasional feral horses grazing through. The horses are descendants of animals left by settlers long gone and they're now unofficial mascots of the area. Alongside them, you might spot armadillos digging through the undergrowth, woodpeckers hammering tree trunks or raccoons engaging in tiny heists. Trails like the South End Trail or the Parallel Trail weave through dense foliage, sometimes giving glimpses of marshes or hidden historic sites.

First documented in 1537, around the time when settlers from São Miguel began expanding westward, Vila Franca Islet has played many roles throughout its history. It has served as a military fort, a port, a vineyard site and even a lookout for whale-watching.\nOnce a volcanic crater, this islet is now a protected nature reserve teeming with unique marine life, including bird species like Bulwer's petrel, little egret and sooty tern. The unique shape of this tiny island, sculpted by nature, makes it truly special. At its heart lies an almost perfectly circular lagoon, linked to the sea by a narrow channel called Boquete. Since the opening faces north toward São Miguel, it shields the lagoon from ocean waves and forms a calm natural harbour with a sandy beach. It's no wonder the spot is a favourite for swimmers: from June to October, ferries run daily between the town and the islet. Access is limited to 400 visitors a day—do you want to be one of them?",

		"description": "Experience the magic of the summer solstice at Seljalandsfoss waterfall in Iceland. Today, the Northern Hemisphere celebrates the longest day of the year, when the sun reaches its highest point in the sky. Seljalandsfoss, located along Iceland's South Coast, offers a stunning backdrop for this astronomical event. The 60-metre waterfall drops from cliffs that once marked the country's coastline. The cascading water is part of the Seljalandsa River, originating from the volcanic glacier Eyjafjallajökull. The volcano under the icecap last erupted in 2010, causing disruption for locals and air traffic. Visitors can walk behind the falls into a small cave, offering a unique perspective and making it a favourite spot for photographers. Floodlights illuminate the waterfall at night, creating a magical scene.\nIf you are planning a vacation during the summer solstice, Seljalandsfoss is worth adding to your travel bucket list. Whether you're a nature enthusiast or a photography lover, this experience promises unforgettable memories.",

This annual event, organised by the Giraffe Conservation Foundation, raises awareness about the declining giraffe population, which has decreased by nearly 30% over the past 35 years. Masai giraffes, known for their distinctive, jagged blotches, are native to East Africa. Besides Kenya and Uganda, they roam the vast plains of Tanzania's Serengeti, a name derived from the Maasai word 'seringit,' meaning 'endless plains.' Today's image captures a tender moment between a Masai giraffe mother and her calf in this stunning landscape. With only approximately 117,000 giraffes remaining in the wild, the time to act is now.\nBy supporting World Giraffe Day, you can help ensure the survival of these incredible creatures and contribute to conservation efforts that protect their natural habitat.

Established in 2017 by Rainforest Partnership—a nonprofit environmental organisation—the day raises awareness about the importance of rainforests and mobilises efforts to protect them.\nOne notable region of the Amazon rainforest is in Ecuador. Although smaller than Brazil's share, it's considered one of the most biologically dense areas on Earth. It also shelters an extraordinary range of life—jaguars, macaws, black caimans, electric eels and medicinal plants, many still unknown to science. This part of the rainforest is home to Indigenous groups, including uncontacted tribes whose territories are legally protected. But their way of life is increasingly threatened by industrial activities, especially oil drilling. World Rainforest Day reminds us that the protection of rainforests is possible through personal choices and collective action. From reducing paper use to supporting rainforest-friendly products, people can make tangible impacts that reach Ecuador's Amazon and beyond.",

The city, once called 'the Florence on the Elbe,' was nearly wiped off the map in 1945 during World War II. Since then, it has rebuilt itself into a place where modern museums, Baroque buildings and riverside views share the same frame. Much of the city's oldest architecture can be found in the boroughs of Altstadt (Old Town) and Neustadt (New Town). The surrounding neighbourhoods, originally planned by Saxon monarchs in the 18th and 19th centuries, are named after Saxon sovereigns like Friedrichstadt and Albertstadt.\nWhile you're here, consider strolling through Zwinger—a palatial complex—for a glimpse of royal history, or attend a performance at the Semperoper, where opera and architecture meet. The Old Masters Picture Gallery and the Green Vault are must-sees for art and history fans. Don't skip Neustadt—it has a trendier vibe, packed with street art, indie shops and craft beer spots.

What you see at Arches National Park in Utah, United States, is the result of over 300 million years of erosion, uplift and weathering. These arches were formed when salt beds were left behind by ancient seas. Over time, layers of sandstone cracked, shifted and slowly wore away, revealing more than 2,000 natural arches. These formations are made mostly of Entrada and Navajo sandstone. The park was recognised as a national monument in 1929 and was later upgraded to national park status in 1971.\nDelicate Arch, in Arches National Park, is one of the most recognisable natural arches in the American Southwest. Originally known by several other names—including 'the Chaps' and 'Salt Wash Arch'—it wasn't officially called Delicate Arch until the 1930s, after a scientific expedition described it as 'delicate-looking.' It is Utah's unofficial mascot, appearing on everything from state licence plates to a United States postage stamp issued in 1996 to mark 100 years of Utah statehood. The arch is accessible via a moderately difficult hike that climbs over slickrock and skirts steep drop-offs. Whether you're a geology enthusiast or simply looking for a view worth the effort, Delicate Arch delivers.",

This ancient formation, pictured here, seems as if nature itself has sculpted a mythical creature forever poised to drink from the sea. Estimated to be 500 million years old, the rock's uncanny resemblance to a horse bending its neck is the result of wind and wave erosion. As one of the region's oldest and most iconic landmarks, it attracts hikers, photographers and nature lovers year-round. The best views are from the elevated track between Camel Rock and Murunna Point, while the more daring can scramble around from Camel Rock Surf Beach, though only safely at low tide.\nBermagui, about 380 kilometres south of Sydney, sits under Gulaga, also known as Mount Dromedary. Gulaga is a sacred mountain for the Yuin peoples, an Australian Aboriginal group, who call it Mother Mountain.

The splendid leaf frog, or splendid treefrog, is a rainforest resident with a flair for the dramatic: neon legs, sticky feet and a disappearing act. One minute it's a humble green leaf, the next it's a flash of colour mid-leap, startling predators. This frog lives high in the canopies of Central and South America, especially in Costa Rica, Panama and parts of Ecuador and Colombia. This amphibian is a nocturnal ninja, spending its days snoozing on leaves and its nights foraging for insects. With vertical pupils and a golden glow, its oversized eyes help this frog spot prey in the dark. Thanks to sticky toe pads and strong limbs, it can cling to branches and leaves like a pro, even in the canopy's slippery heights.\nBreeding season gets creative. Females lay their eggs on leaves overhanging small pools or puddles. Once the eggs hatch, the tadpoles drop into the water below—no parental supervision required. With a dash of colour, a splash of stealth and a leap of faith, this species knows how to keep things un-frog-ettable.",

		"description": "In the early hours of June 28, 1969, a police raid at the Stonewall Inn in New York's Greenwich Village, met unexpected resistance. Fed up with years of harassment, LGBTQIA+ patrons fought back. What followed was six days of unrest—and the start of a movement. Led in part by American trans activists like Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, the uprising challenged not only police brutality but society's silence. Stonewall wasn't the beginning of queer existence, but it was the moment people said 'no more' loud enough to be heard worldwide.\nThe first Pride marches came the next year, not as parties, but as protests. Thousands marched in New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago to mark the anniversary of Stonewall. In Canada, similar calls for justice followed. The 'We Demand' protest in 1971 on Parliament Hill sparked several small-scale gatherings across the country, which became Canada's first large-scale public LGBTQ demonstrations. This was followed by the first Pride Week in Toronto in 1972, which included a march to Queen's Park.\nToday, Stonewall stands as a symbol of resilience. It reminds us that Pride began with bricks, not branding. So, as rainbow flags wave each June, remember the power of resistance—and that the first Pride was a riot with a cause.",

The tropics span a broad region between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn, including parts of Asia, Africa, Oceania, Central America and South America. Nearly 40% of the global population lives in this band, which also hosts 80% of the world's biodiversity. It's rich in culture, nature and history—but also under pressure from rising temperatures, deforestation and fast-paced urban growth.\nFor a tropical tale with extra flavour, look no further than Pulau Ay, photographed here. Nutmeg was once one of the world's most sought-after commodities—and this tiny island in Indonesia's Banda Islands played a key role in its global trade. It once sparked global rivalries and deadly sea battles, influencing the geopolitical boundaries of the modern world. Today, Pulau Ay is a place where reefs shine, nutmeg continues to thrive and history lingers in moss-covered forts. Visitors can snorkel along coral gardens, wander through spice groves or sit with locals drying mace under the sun. So, today's mission? Celebrate, sure—but also reflect, learn and act.",

Native to the Indo-Pacific, from western Indonesia to Taiwan and the Great Barrier Reef, this species lives on the edges of coral reefs. This fish is easily distinguished by the spine extending from each cheek—hence the name. Groups of spine-cheeked anemonefish form around a single dominant female, and if she disappears, the top male steps up—literally changing sex to take her place. It thrives in warm, shallow waters and sticks close to its chosen sea anemone.\nThe closest marine companion of a spine-cheeked anemonefish is the bubble-tip anemone, as seen in the image. These anemones don't all look alike—their appearances often vary with age, depth and whether they host anemonefish. This species offers the perfect mix of cover and protection.

Its streamlined body, reinforced skull and built-in shock absorbers, such as spongy bone plates and air sacs beneath the skin, make these high-impact dives both powerful and safe. Once underwater, the gannet uses its wings and webbed feet to swim after fish, diving as deep as 21 metres and staying submerged for up to 30 seconds.

		"description": "Italy's Dolomites don't just tower; they enchant, turning every trail into a story. Fondly known as the 'Pale Mountains,' the Dolomites derive their name from dolomite—a carbonate mineral. Set in the northern Italian Alps, the range spans almost 16,000 square kilometres and boasts 18 soaring peaks that rise above 2,900 metres. These mountains feature sheer cliffs, lofty walls and a maze of narrow, winding valleys.\nAmid the dramatic landscape of the Dolomites lies one of its most spectacular peaks, Seceda, featured in today's image. With a height of around 2,500 metres, it offers the highest panoramic viewpoint in Val Gardena, a scenic valley in the province of South Tyrol. A short cable car ride takes you to the summit, bypassing what would otherwise be a strenuous hike. Once at the top, you're greeted by a stunning sweep of the Dolomites' iconic jagged ridgelines. On a clear day, you might even spot Austria's tallest mountain, the Großglockner, located more than 145 kilometres away.",

This pivotal date marks the moment in 1816 when delegates from across the region gathered in the city of San Miguel de Tucumán to declare freedom from Spanish colonial rule. The road to independence was not easy; it followed years of internal struggles and revolutions influenced by global movements, including the American and French revolutions. But the resolve of the Argentine people prevailed.\nSince gaining independence, Argentina has taken important steps in shaping its national identity. The drafting of its first constitution in 1853 established a framework for democratic governance that continues to influence its political system. The country has also made notable contributions to global culture and sports. It has offered the world literary figures like Jorge Luis Borges, a rich culinary tradition cantered on asado (a traditional barbecue) and legendary athletes such as Diego Maradona and Lionel Messi. Constitución railway station in Buenos Aires, pictured here, is a historic hub that reflects Argentina's drive for growth, connectivity and the spirit of unity that emerged during a transformative era.",

After decades of legal negotiations and a growing push for self-governance, the Bahamas transitioned to full independence on this day in 1973.\nIn the lead-up to July 10, Bahamians across the archipelago take part in spirited celebrations, including National Pride Day, ecumenical services and community walks and runs. These events shine a spotlight on the nation's vibrant culture, heritage and deep sense of patriotism. And what better backdrop for such festivities than the breathtaking turquoise waters that surround the islands? The shallow, white sandbanks reflect sunlight in a way that gives the ocean its signature electric-blue glow, pictured here.

First observed in 1989, the day focuses on how unchecked population growth affects sustainability. The event was inspired by Five Billion Day in 1987, which marked the approximate date when the global population hit that milestone. As cities expand, green spaces shrink and agriculture competes for limited land and water resources. But there is a way forward—investing in education, improving access to healthcare and building smarter cities can balance growth with sustainability.\nOn a global scale, India remains the most populous country in 2025 with over 1.46 billion people, followed by China at 1.41 billion. Canada's population is estimated at over 40 million, with steady growth driven largely by immigration and urban expansion. Tokyo, the world's largest city with around 37.2 million people, illustrates the realities of high-density urban life: overcrowded spaces, transport congestion and rising demand for services. World Population Day is more than a head count—it's a call for better planning and long-term thinking to ensure future generations can thrive on a planet with finite resources.",

This stretch of savannah in southwestern Kenya teems with wildlife—from elephants stomping through bushes to cheetahs scanning the horizon. Yet sometimes it's the smaller creatures that grab attention—like the Thomson's gazelles featured in today's image.\nKnown as 'tommies,' Thomson's gazelles are among the fastest animals in Africa, reaching speeds of up to 80 kilometres per hour. They thrive in the Mara's short grass plains, which provide a clear view of approaching predators. Though adults may seem to be grazing peacefully, their ears are always tuned to nearby movements.\nMating occurs year-round, peaking just before the rainy season. Males hold territories, waiting for females to pass through. After a five- to six-month gestation period, the female gives birth to one fawn, weighing around 1.8 to 2.7 kilograms. For the first few weeks, the small gazelle stays hidden most of the day. The mother returns briefly to nurse, minimising attention from predators. These early days are crucial as the young learn to run and blend in. Despite their delicate appearance, tommies are tough. Many join the great migration during the dry season, relying on their agility and the awareness of wildebeests and zebras to evade danger in search of greener plains.",

From Stone Age tools to the minerals powering modern civilisation, rocks have been essential throughout our journey. International Rock Day celebrates this enduring impact, inviting us to explore the science of rocks, admire their natural beauty and recognise the rich variety they add to our world.\nIf you're wondering where to see geology in action, Iceland is a great place to explore. Today's image takes us to Kálfshamarsvík—a secluded cove on the country's remote Skagi peninsula. Unlike Iceland's famous black sand beaches, this cove's shore is strewn with large, smooth pebbles, while its fiery volcanic past still reveals itself in the towering cliffs. Here, evidence of volcanic activity is on full display in the form of rare hexagonal basalt columns. These sea cliffs are shaped into natural sculptures so symmetrical that they look almost man-made. These striking formations were created around 2 million years ago, when thick basalt lava cooled slowly, contracting and cracking into geometric shapes that formed near-perfect hexagons. Though Iceland is full of volcanic marvels, formations like these are rare, making this quiet cove truly remarkable.",

Protecting sharks means preserving the health of entire ocean environments—and ultimately, securing a sustainable future for all life. With many shark species facing the threat of extinction, this day is all about appreciating their ancient legacy and learning how we can help keep them off the endangered list.\nTake the blue shark, featured here, for example—sleek, wide-ranging and undeniably captivating. It's the only living member of its genus, and it prefers the deep waters of temperate and tropical oceans. While typically a laid-back swimmer, it's capable of sudden bursts of speed when needed. Blue sharks are famous for their epic migrations—some travel from New England to South America, guided by seasonal changes, food availability and favourable environmental conditions. They give birth to live young and are known for their large litters—ranging from 25 to over 100 pups. After birth, the young head to special nursery zones, far from adult habitats, where they can grow and learn the ways of the sea.",

Active from mid-July through late August, it reaches its spectacular peak on the night of August 12 into the early hours of August 13 this year. The Perseids light up the skies when Earth passes through a trail of icy and rocky debris left behind by Comet Swift–Tuttle, which last passed close to our planet in 1992. These meteors are called the Perseids because they appear to streak from the direction of the constellation Perseus.\nFor those hoping to catch a glimpse of this breathtaking show, the Perseid meteor shower is best viewed from the Northern Hemisphere, extending down to the mid-southern latitudes. One such vantage point is Great Basin National Park in Nevada, United States, seen in today's image, where ancient bristlecone pines stand beneath a sky ablaze with shooting stars. These remarkable trees are the oldest non-clonal species on Earth. Shaped by relentless wind, snow and rain, they've endured for millennia—witnessing ice ages, volcanic eruptions and the rise and fall of civilisations.

From late June to mid-July, this high plateau transforms into a purple sea of lavender. Situated more than 580 metres above sea level and spanning approximately 780 square kilometres, it is one of the largest areas in France dedicated to lavender cultivation.\nLavender has flourished in Provence for centuries. The ancient Romans brought the plant to southern France, using it for bathing, cooking and healing. The word itself comes from 'lavare,' Latin for 'to wash.' By the Middle Ages, local monks were cultivating it for medicinal purposes. The real boom came in the 19th century, when the perfume industry in nearby Grasse took off. Over time, lavender fields spread across Provence, especially in high-sun, well-drained areas like Valensole. Today, 1,700 growers tend to around 250 square kilometres of these shrubs. They cultivate both traditional lavender—for perfumes and skincare—and lavandin, the longer-stemmed cousin often found in household cleaning products and air fresheners. So don't just leave it to chance—plan ahead, follow the scent trail and let your summer bloom with lavender memories.",

Today, on International Day for the Conservation of the Mangrove Ecosystem, we honour these extraordinary trees and the critical role they play in sustaining life on our planet.\nMangroves are nature's coastal guardians. With their arching and salt-filtering roots, they thrive where few trees can—anchored in brackish water, enduring tides and shifting sands. They protect shorelines from erosion, buffer communities against storms and serve as nurseries for countless marine animals. Their tangled root systems not only stabilise sediment but also provide shelter for juvenile fish, crabs and birds. Mangroves also trap carbon at rates far higher than most forests, making them powerful allies in the fight against climate change. Yet they are disappearing at an alarming rate due to development, pollution and rising sea levels. Let this day be a call to action. Whether through education, restoration or advocacy, we all have a role in preserving these vital ecosystems. Because when we protect mangroves, we protect the future.",

		"description": "Being surrounded by a shimmering spiral of silver—that's what it feels like to encounter a school of blackfin barracuda at Shark Reef in Ras Mohammed National Park, Egypt. These streamlined fish, marked by sharp V-shaped stripes, move in near-perfect unison. Their slow, deliberate spirals aren't random—they're an evolutionary strategy that offers both safety in numbers and an edge in hunting. Blackfin barracudas are found throughout tropical waters, from the Red Sea to the central Pacific. During the day, they gather in tight, coordinated groups near the reef, scattering at dusk to pursue prey.\nRas Mohammed, at the southern tip of Egypt's Sinai Peninsula, is known for much more than striking fish formations. As the country's first marine protected area, it shelters over 1,000 fish species and more than 200 types of coral. The park is considered a living archive of ecological complexity, where even a fleeting school of barracuda reveals a deeper story of life beneath the surface.",

These ecosystems are among the largest intact temperate grasslands on Earth, stretching across millions of square kilometres of open steppe. They support around 200,000 nomadic herder families and provide habitat for rare species like the Mongolian gazelle and snow leopard.\nWhile the day isn't tied to a single founding organisation, it aligns with the mission of global conservation leaders like the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which has worked to protect biodiversity since 1948. That mission lives on across Mongolia's open steppe, where nomadic herder families still live in traditional white yurts that dot the grasslands like part of the ecosystem itself. Here, nature isn't just a backdrop—it's home. And Mongolia's grasslands show how people and wildlife can thrive together when ecosystems are respected and protected.",

Every year, International Tiger Day draws attention to these powerful yet endangered big cats. Bengal tigers are more than their unmistakable orange coats and black stripes. They are apex predators, essential to the health and balance of the ecosystems they inhabit. By keeping prey populations like deer and wild boar in check, tigers help shape vegetation patterns and support the overall biodiversity of their environments.\nOne of the best places to see this delicate natural balance in action is Kanha National Park. Among India's oldest protected areas, it was first declared a reserve forest in 1879 and later a national park in 1955. It then became one of the first nine tiger reserves under Project Tiger in 1973, a landmark initiative launched to halt the steep decline in the species. Yet, despite decades of progress, tigers still face threats from habitat fragmentation, poaching and conflict with humans. That's why landscapes like Kanha remain critical—not just for tigers, but for the future of forests and wildlife conservation across the planet.",

Celebrated every July 30, the International Day of Friendship reminds us that tackling global challenges, like poverty, violence and injustice, starts with something surprisingly simple: human connection. That's exactly what artist Saype had in mind with 'Beyond Walls,' a series of massive, biodegradable land-art murals featuring interlinked hands. Symbolising unity and solidarity, these works have stretched across five continents. At Expo 2020 Dubai, Saype's 11th installation covered over 1,486 square metres of grass in Al Forsan Park. It formed a striking black-and-white handshake that could only be fully appreciated from above, as seen here. The piece, made with eco-friendly paint, was unveiled on Switzerland's National Day, supported by the Swiss Pavilion.\nProclaimed by the UN in 2011, the International Day of Friendship calls for building bonds across borders, cultures and generations. So, today, take a cue from Saype: reach out, connect and be part of a global human chain. Sometimes, the most powerful message begins with a single gesture.",

During summer, some arrive by kayak, but all visitors need permits to stay.\nLong before camping permits and composting toilets, this remote stretch supported generations of Native Hawaiians. Thanks to freshwater streams and fertile soil, early Hawaiians farmed taro (a root vegetable widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions) in stone terraces. Fishing, farming and a deep spiritual connection to the land (āina) shaped daily life. Remnants of temples and house sites still lie hidden in the valley's folds. By the 1920s, most residents had left due to disease, Western contact and shifting land use. In recent decades, off-the-grid seekers sought refuge here until state protections were implemented.

That spirit of rebellion stuck, and the Fringe was born.\nNow it's the world's largest arts festival, with thousands of shows crammed into three action-packed weeks. Anyone can perform. If you have an idea and a venue, you're in. Even a shipping container counts—yes, that really happened. Comedy is the unofficial king of the festival, but there's also drama, dance, drag, musicals, magic, mime, spoken word, circus and acts that defy all categories. Comedy rules the roost: Canadian standups like Glenn Wool (a frequent Fringe performer since the '90s), JJ Whitehead (14 appearances to his credit) and Dana Alexander (a Chortle-nominated comic) have all brought their humour here. Street performers flood the Royal Mile, pictured here, offering sneak peeks, juggling acts and flyers. The Edinburgh Festival Fringe is where experimental performances and high-end theatre thrive.

Designated a national park in 1971, Capitol Reef invites reflection—not just on its vivid geology, but on the ancient narratives and cultural heritage etched into its landscape.\nLong before visitors laced up hiking boots and hit the trails at Capitol Reef, the Fremont and Ancestral Puebloan peoples called this place home. Between 300 and 1300 CE, they lived in pit houses and natural rock shelters, weaving farming into their hunter-gatherer lifestyle. Their connection to the land was both spiritual and practical—and they left behind some of the park's most captivating features, including petroglyphs like those found in Fruita, featured in today's image. These rock panels showcase an ancient visual language, featuring human figures adorned with headdresses and jewellery.

These annual plants are known for their large, daisy-like flowers and radiant charm. While sunflowers come in shades of red, orange and maroon, it's the classic yellow blooms with brown centres that are the most common.\nBeyond their good looks, sunflowers are grown for their tasty seeds, which are snacked on, pressed for cooking oil or offered as a treat for birds. Their value isn't a modern discovery—Native Americans cultivated them thousands of years ago. Sunflowers were often planted alongside corn, beans and squash as a symbolic 'fourth sister,' reflecting their importance long before they became garden icons. In Canada, sunflower fields flourish across Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec, with Manitoba alone producing about 90% of the country's crop. Visitors flock to sunflower farms in Ontario each summer to enjoy their photogenic landscapes and seasonal festivals. Sunflowers remain a key part of Canadian agriculture, supporting both domestic markets and exports, and continue to brighten farms, fields and festivals across the country.",

Known as the world's largest owl species by length, which ranges from 61 to 84 centimetres, they span the Northern Hemisphere and are found in both the Eastern and Western Hemispheres. Unlike many birds, they don't build their own nests—instead, they repurpose those left behind by large raptors or settle into broken treetops and hollow trunks. Despite their size and status as apex predators, they are non-aggressive, rarely clashing with rivals or intruders.

		"description": "Not every science lesson requires a classroom. In La Jolla in California, United States, tide pools teach you about ocean life—right at your feet. Along the rocky shoreline of this San Diego coastal neighbourhood, tide pools form during low tide as seawater gets trapped in natural depressions. These shallow pools form naturally along La Jolla's rocky shorelines, especially near Windansea Beach, Shell Beach, South Casa Beach and Hospital Point. The water that remains trapped in sandstone and reef depressions creates habitats for everything from sea hares to brittle stars.\nOver time, the tide pools are created through the process of erosion—waves hit the sandstone and limestone coastlines until they carve out pockets that hold water. Twice a day, as the tide moves in and out, these spaces flood and drain, challenging the survival skills of everything inside. Winter months, when tides are lowest during daylight hours, are ideal for observing them. And remember, these pools are protected under California's Marine Life Protection Act. Enjoy the view, observe those residing in the depressions, take pictures, but don't disturb anything. It is marine biology in motion, and it's free.",

		"description": "It looks like this small creature is playing a game, right? But when a baby ring-tailed lemur wraps its tail around or gives it a tug, it's actually working on crucial skills. The infants spend their early weeks hanging tight to their mom, first clinging to her belly and later to her back. As they grow, they separate from their mom, and tail-chasing becomes part of how they learn balance, coordination and group play. These primates use their long tails for communication as well. Raised like flags during group movement, the tails help them stick together in open terrain. Loud, rhythmic calls, scent markings and 'stink fights' between males add to the social drama.\nRing-tailed lemurs are found only in southern and southwestern Madagascar, where they live in dry forests, spiny thickets and rocky outcrops. They live in female-dominated groups, sometimes up to 30 individuals. Habitat loss due to slash-and-burn agriculture and charcoal production has pushed them into vulnerable status, despite being one of the most studied lemurs.",

The Mingan Archipelago National Park Reserve, where these formations are found, is a quiet haven for wildlife established in 1984. The area is a seasonal stop for Atlantic puffins, which arrive between late May and August to breed and raise their chicks on the cliffs and grassy spaces.

		"description": "Toronto's summer ritual rolls in today—big wheels turning, bands tuning up and crowds filing through the gates. The Canadian National Exhibition is back, and it's bringing the full line-up with it. From the gravity-defying Orbitor ride, seen in today's image, to deep-fried everything, The Ex blends nostalgia with new thrills each year. First held in 1879, it started as a showcase of agriculture and technology. While these themes still feature in areas like the Farm Pavilion and Innovation Garage, the exhibition now also includes large-scale entertainment and sports programming.\nKey attractions include the Midway with over 60 rides, the SuperDogs shows and nightly concerts at the Bandshell, which hosts both local and international performers. The Food Building features more than 100 vendors, and new food trends are introduced annually. And, of course, the sky isn't left out. The Canadian International Air Show is set to return over the Labour Day weekend with the Snowbirds and other aerobatic teams. Whether you're eight or eighty, there's something here that'll pull you in.",

		"description": "If you think bees are just out for a sting, think again. These tiny winged workers are running the world's sweetest gig—and they've got a whole day dedicated to their buzz-ness. Welcome to World Honey Bee Day, celebrated every third Saturday in August. About 35% of global food crop production relies on animal pollination, including honey bees. The value of crops pollinated by bees is estimated at over CAD 400 billion. Canada is home to over 800 native bee species, with honey bees playing a major role in pollinating crops like blueberries, apples and canola. Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan lead in honey production. Despite their superpowers, bees are in a sticky situation. Habitat loss, pesticides, disease and climate change are making life in the hive less than ideal.\nToday's image features a row of bright boxes in Italy—those are beehives. Bees use colour to distinguish between hives, much like humans use house numbers. Blue, yellow, green and red hives help reduce confusion and accidental hive invasions. On World Honey Bee Day, let's think outside the hive. Whether it's through colourful conservation, mindful eating or planting for pollinators, there's always a way to 'bee' involved.",

		"description": "Built to brave storms and steer ships to safety, lighthouses now glow as symbols of heritage, wonder and connection. Each year on the third weekend of August, the International Lighthouse Lightship Weekend brings together people from around the globe to celebrate these coastal icons. The event was launched in 1998 by John Forsyth and Mike Dalrymple of Scotland's Ayr Amateur Radio Group. It aims to raise awareness about preserving lighthouses and lightships while also promoting amateur radio and encouraging international goodwill.\nAmong the many lighthouses that carry this legacy forward is the Lyngvig Lighthouse in Denmark, featured here. Standing over 37 metres tall, this tower was built in 1906 atop a 17-metre dune along the west coast of Jutland—the country's westernmost region. Made with a concrete foundation and brick walls, and finished with teak-framed windows and doors, the lighthouse originally required a team of three keepers. They maintained its light until 1965. It has been operating automatically ever since. Following a temporary closure in 2024 due to structural concerns, the lighthouse is now open to the public again.",

Tucked away in the Adirondack High Peaks in New York, United States, this 0.04-square-kilometres alpine lake sits at nearly 880 metres between Mount Colden and Avalanche Mountain. Shaped by ancient glaciers, the lake is framed by dramatic cliffs and rugged terrain that echo its icy origins. Its most striking feature is the Trap Dike—a towering 370 metre rock canyon flanked by steep walls, making the lake one of the most awe-inspiring sights in the Adirondacks. Massive avalanches carved these cliffs, leaving behind the dramatic landscape that gave Avalanche Lake its name.\nThe Avalanche Lake Trail begins at the Adirondack Loj, a well-known launch point for adventures in the High Peaks. Spanning about 15.5 kilometres round trip with a 410 metres elevation gain, the hike may seem manageable on paper—but it's the uneven terrain that truly tests your mettle.",

On Vancouver Island, the Pacific crashes into cliffs and the fog rolls in covering the long-standing trees. This rugged landmass off British Columbia's southwest coast has long been home to Indigenous communities, including the Nuu-chah-nulth, Coast Salish and Kwakwaka'wakw peoples. The island's colonial past began in the mid-1800s with the Hudson's Bay Company and the British Crown establishing settlements like Fort Victoria.\nA walk through Pacific Rim National Park Reserve tells an interesting story. The West Coast Trail runs past shipwreck sites and rain-soaked headlands that once tested sailors' skills. Strathcona Provincial Park, the oldest in BC, offers alpine lakes and the island's highest peak, Golden Hinde, at 2,198 metres. The island's ecosystems support a range of species, many of which—like the Vancouver Island marmot, Roosevelt elk, coastal sea wolf and marbled murrelet—are found only in this corner of the country.

Bonifacio didn't begin as a picturesque tourist destination—it was originally established as a coastal fortification and has spent centuries guarding one of the Mediterranean's busiest sea lanes. Established in 828 CE by Boniface II of Tuscany, the commune gradually became a meeting point for traders, soldiers and sailors—each group contributing to the evolution of the town's structure. Bonifacio is divided into two sections, with the 'vieille ville' (old town)—also known as 'la Haute Ville' (the Upper City)—standing on a high cliff within the original citadel walls. Below, the marine area lines the narrow inlet with harbours, waterfront homes and a growing valley community.\nWhile here, the Bonifacio Citadel is a must-see. First built in the 9th century and expanded over time, it invites visitors to wander through quiet passageways, old military buildings and cobblestone streets. Nearby, you can explore the Marine Cemetery, climb the King of Aragon's Stairway and visit the Bastion de l'Étendard, now home to a small museum.",

These ground-dwelling songbirds belong to the Oenanthe genus and are known for their upright posture and habit of hopping or sprinting between perches. Despite the name, wheatears have nothing to do with wheat or ears—the name is a twist on the old phrase 'white arse,' pointing to the bird's distinctive white rump found in most species.\nGlobally, there are around 20 species of wheatears, but in North America, the northern wheatear is the one you're most likely to encounter. It weighs less than 30 grams, but travels thousands of kilometres between its summer homes in Alaska and northern Canada to its wintering grounds in Africa. Its migration route is one of the longest for a bird its size, crossing oceans and continents. Unlike many backyard songbirds, wheatears prefer wide-open spaces with low vegetation, where they can sprint and pounce on insects. And while most North American birders might only catch them in the far north, wheatears are widespread across Europe, Asia and Africa.",

The wheat-covered slopes shift in colour with every passing season. In spring, the hills turn lush shades of green as young wheat and barley begin to grow, while summer transforms them into dry, golden browns as the crops near harvest.\nOften hailed as one of Washington State's most serene natural wonders, the Palouse owes its signature rolling hills to an ancient and fascinating geological story. These dune-like hills were shaped over thousands of years—not by rivers or tectonic shifts, but by windblown dust and fine silt, known as 'loess,' carried from the arid Southwest. During the Ice Ages, glaciers from Canada ground rock into fine 'glacial flour,' which flowed into the prehistoric Glacial Lake Missoula. When ice dams broke, floods swept across eastern Washington, leaving behind layers of silt. Prevailing winds later carried that dust to this region, settling it into the hills we see today.",

The cathedral was dedicated to St. Barbara, the patron saint of miners—an enduring symbol for a community whose lifeblood was silver. The miners themselves played a key role in building the cathedral that still bears her name.\nConstruction began in the Middle Ages but wasn't completed until the 20th century, weaving together Gothic artistry and modern details. Originally envisioned on a much grander scale—twice its current size—the cathedral's fate was tied to the fortunes of the silver mines. As the mines declined, so did the ambitions. By 1588, only the iconic three-peaked roof had been completed, and a temporary wall signalled the halt of construction. In the years that followed, the Jesuits took over, gradually introducing Baroque elements into the original Gothic design. Restoration efforts finally took shape in the late 19th century, led by architects Josef Mocker and Ludvik Labler.",

These medium-sized deer have been strutting through British woodlands and parklands for centuries. Though they look right at home, they weren't born here. The Romans likely brought them over, and the Normans later made them common in hunting parks. Now, they're regulars in landscapes from Sussex to Scotland.\nIn summer, these animals sport a reddish-brown coat with white spots. Come winter, they trade it for a darker, greyer version. Bucks (males) grow broad, shovel-shaped antlers, unlike the pointy racks of red or roe deer. In autumn, the bucks clash antlers in the rutting season, competing for the attention of does (females). Fallow deer graze mainly on grasses and leaves, but they won't turn their noses up at herbs, shrubs or the occasional snack from a fruit tree. Despite their poise, they're quick to bolt if spooked. That flash of white tail you see? That's their way of saying 'time to run.' It's also a signal to the rest of the herd.",

Northern gannets are anything but quiet—especially when gathered by the tens of thousands on Bonaventure Island's cliffs in Quebec. Each year, they come together to feed, breed and raise their young. These seabirds are high-speed hunters. Spotting fish from 70 metres up, they fold their wings and dive at speeds nearing 100 km/h. Air sacs in the skull protect them from the force of impact, allowing them to grab prey like herring, capelin and sand lance underwater with accuracy.\nBut it isn't just about fishing. Every April, adult gannets return to their old nesting spots, reuniting with mates through head-bobbing and beak-touching displays. Space is congested. Each nest is just a few centimetres from the next one, made from seaweed, plants, solid and marine debris. Incubation takes 42 to 46 days and hatching takes up to 36 hours, after which the chick is born featherless and hungry. Parents take turns feeding it until it is strong enough to fly. And when migration time comes, it heads south solo. It's a rough start—but these birds were made for the wild.",

But instead of magic wands, it was limestone, mortar-free masonry and—according to some theories—a bit of tax evasion that built this town's signature homes: the trulli. These are whitewashed stone houses topped with dry-stacked limestone roofs shaped like upside-down ice cream cones. It's an ancient building technique, and in this case, a clever one. Back in the 14th century, locals were reportedly trying to avoid property taxes by constructing homes that could be quickly dismantled when the king's tax collector came around.\nAlberobello's trulli aren't hidden one-offs. Entire districts—like Rione Monti and Aia Piccola—are packed with these quirky structures. Some are still lived in, while others have been transformed into cafés, souvenir shops and pint-sized museums. You'll even find a church built in trullo style. In 1996, UNESCO gave the trulli of Alberobello the heritage stamp of approval. It's not every day that a loophole becomes a landmark.",

Patient and precise, they stand motionless for minutes, waiting for just the right moment to deliver a lightning-fast strike. Fish are their main prey, but they also eat frogs, reptiles and even small mammals. In Canada, great egrets are seasonal visitors, commonly spotted in southern Ontario and southern Quebec during the warmer months.\nOnce pushed to the brink by the global feather trade—driven in part by fashion trends across North America—their population plummeted by an estimated 95% in the late 1800s. The killing might have continued if not for two Boston socialites, Harriet Hemenway and Minna Hall, who led a boycott of the feather trade. Their activism helped launch the National Audubon Society. It also pushed Congress to pass the Weeks–McLean Law in 1913, which banned market hunting and protected migratory birds. Today, the great egret is a powerful conservation success story thanks to more than a century of legal protection and public action. It also serves as the Audubon Society's symbol.",

Their mouths can stretch over 1.2 metres, but they feed by suction, not biting. Each has a unique pattern of white spots and stripes—no two alike—used by researchers to track individuals. Their breeding patterns remain largely a mystery, but they are ovoviviparous, meaning pups hatch inside the mother before being born alive.

The camel thorn trees that once grew here didn't collapse or vanish. The extreme aridity and high salt content in the soil stopped the natural process in its tracks. Under those conditions, even decay gave up. The trees were embalmed by the desert—sun-dried, rigid and rooted in place for up to 900 years.

		"description": "Established in 1918 to preserve the aftermath of the Novarupta eruption, Katmai National Park and Preserve in southern Alaska, United States, spans over 16,500 square kilometres of raw wilderness. It is home to the alpine tundra, boreal forests and salmon-rich rivers that support brown bears, moose, wolves and hundreds of bird species, including the rare Aleutian tern. Also residing here is one of the most iconic symbols of the North American wilderness—the grizzly bear. Don't be fooled by their shaggy coats and lumbering walk—these predators can weigh up to 410 kilograms and still run at 56 km/h. Young grizzlies often 'play-fight' to build strength, sharpen survival skills and figure out their place in bear society. It may look cute, but it's serious practice for life in the wild.\nIn Canada, grizzlies are mainly found in British Columbia, Alberta, the Yukon and parts of the Northwest Territories. While coastal bears grow larger, those in Canada's northern interior are much smaller—males average 139 kilograms and females around 95 kilograms, similar in size to the American black bears in the same region. Whether in Alaska or Canada, grizzly bears remain one of the most formidable mammals in the wild.",

Today marks the 50th edition of the Toronto International Film Festival, a milestone for a festival that has helped shape global cinema for decades. Since 1976, films like 'La La Land,' 'Belfast,' 'Jojo Rabbit' and '12 Years a Slave' have made waves here first. But TIFF has never been only about Hollywood. It has also helped shine a spotlight on films from across Asia, Africa, Europe and Latin America, and made space for voices that don't always get big prominent exposure.\nThe 2025 TIFF programme features world premieres, Gala selections, Special Presentations, and more. Among the highlights in the Special Presentations slate are 'Franz,' 'The Lost Bus,' 'Rental Family' and 'Steal Away.' The six newly announced Galas include 'The Choral,' 'Homebound,' 'Hamnet,' 'A Private Life,' 'Roofman' and 'She Has No Name.' Much of the festival action centres around the TIFF Bell Lightbox, located a few streets south of Queen Street and just west of the CN Tower. The surrounding venues—Roy Thomson Hall, Scotiabank Theatre, and Princess of Wales Theatre—each add their own flavour to the festival mix.",

Wide, clean and ready for volleyball or just flopping down with a good book, it's ideal for sunbathers and sandcastle architects alike. And yes, 'Baywatch' was filmed along Santa Monica Bay. Feel free to run in slow motion.\nThen there's the Santa Monica Pier. Built in 1909 and still standing tall on wooden legs, it's got an amusement park called Pacific Park, arcade, restaurants and that famous solar-powered Ferris wheel. Up for more movement? The Marvin Braude Bike Trail, or the Strand, is a 35-kilometre bike path that zips right through the beach. While here, people can rent a cruiser and ride past rollerbladers, dog walkers and tourists trying to juggle ice cream and selfies. Here, the surf is another draw.

Meet the rufous hummingbird—photographed in Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, California, United States. The bird, one of nine species in the genus Selasphorus, gets its name from its rusty, reddish-orange feathers. Males flash copper backs and red throat patches that shimmer in the sun. Females are more subdued but still carry streaks of rufous on their sides and tails.\nThey may look sweet, but these pollinators are known for their aggressive behaviour, often chasing away not just other hummingbirds, but also bees and butterflies. At around 7 centimetres long, this nectar-seeker is a frequent flyer in the most literal sense. Each year, it migrates from Mexico to Alaska and back—a round-trip of up to 13,000 kilometres. That's one of the longest migrations relative to body size in the bird world. And here's the kicker: many return to the exact same gardens and feeders year after year.\nWhether you're planting flowers or peering through binoculars as one zips by, take a moment to slow down and marvel at something tiny but mighty.",

It is part of Tricity—a metropolitan area along the Gdańsk Bay that includes the neighbouring coastal cities of Sopot and Gdynia, along with nearby towns. The city likely takes its name from 'Gdania,' an earlier name for the Motława river that runs through it.\nThe city originated as a Slavic fort in the late 10th century and was first recorded in 997, when it came under the early influence of the Polish state. Over the centuries, Gdańsk has experienced Polish, German and independent rule, each leaving a mark on the region's identity. The Main City draws most visitors, especially to the lively promenade that runs along Ulica Długa (Long Street) and Długi Targ (Long Market). Flanked by decorative gates and lined with stately townhouses rebuilt in 17th-century style, this pedestrian stretch is steeped in charm. Once the ceremonial path for Polish royalty, it's now fondly known as the Royal Route. The path unfolds like a living museum, dotted with historic landmarks like the Highland Gate, Amber Museum, Uphagen's House, Main Town Hall, Neptune's Fountain and the grand Artus Court.",

		"description": "Quick, clever and always on the move—meet the Eurasian red squirrel, a leafy treetop resident found across much of Europe and Asia. While it prefers the shelter of forests, this agile creature easily adapts to gardens and parks. It builds its nest, called a drey, high in the fork of a tree using twigs to form a domed structure about 25 to 30 centimetres wide. The female featured here is gathering moss—one of several soft materials, along with bark, leaves and grass, that line the nest and turn it into a snug, well-insulated retreat. These rodents may also take over tree hollows or abandoned woodpecker holes when available.\nTypically solitary and quite shy, they rarely share food or space. However, during colder months, it's not uncommon for several individuals to use the same nest to stay warm. Their social organisation is shaped by dominance hierarchies, both within and between the sexes. While males aren't always dominant over females, the top-ranking individuals tend to be older and larger. Dominant males also tend to occupy larger home ranges than subordinate males or most females.",

		"description": "'Make hay while the sun shines' may sound like an old proverb, but in farming it's a practical truth. Hay baling plays a crucial role in agriculture worldwide. It involves cutting, drying and packaging grasses to feed livestock during the colder months. The process depends heavily on the weather: the grass must be dry before it's baled, or it risks moulding. Farmers must act quickly once a dry spell arrives, making it a seasonal race.\nThe practice of baling dates back centuries, evolving from horse-powered balers of the 1800s to today's high-powered machines that can wrap and eject bales in minutes. In North Yorkshire, England—where today's image was taken—the rolling lowlands and upland meadows create ideal conditions for growing and curing high-quality hay. With grazing livestock such as sheep and cattle making up around 40% of farm holdings, hay is a key feed resource supporting the region's rural economy. So, when you see golden fields dotted with neat, sunlit rolls, you're witnessing the result of careful timing and hard work. It's a tradition that remains as important today as ever.",

First observed in 2022, World Dolphin Day shines a light on these intelligent marine mammals and the oceans they rely on. The day encourages people to learn about their behaviour and the threats they face. Over 40 dolphin species swim our seas, from the Māui dolphin to the Irrawaddy dolphin. They're expert navigators, problem-solvers and team players. Some even form superpods—temporary gatherings of hundreds or thousands of dolphins moving together offshore.\nOff the coast of Marsa Alam in Egypt, pods of spinner dolphins glide through the warm waters of the Red Sea—as seen in today's image. True to their name, they can leap and spin in the air up to seven times in a single jump. Found in tropical waters across the Pacific, Indian and Atlantic Oceans, they rest during the day in calm bays and hunt offshore at night. But their predictable routines have left them vulnerable to unregulated tourism. Some conservation zones now limit visitor access to allow dolphins to rest undisturbed. The hope? That these creatures continue their spins without interruption.",

Its trail is considered one of the best spots on the West Coast to witness the grey whale migration. In the winter months, nearby secluded beaches become a refuge for northern elephant seals, offering an opportunity for wildlife viewing.

Hunted extensively for their dense fur from 1741 to 1911, sea otters were pushed to the brink of extinction before rebounding through conservation. Still, dangers remain. Oil spills, fishing gear, disease and warming oceans continue to threaten their survival. Otters rely on clean, cold water. Their fur isn't waterproof—it traps air for warmth, and any oil contamination can be fatal. This week serves as a call to notice them—and to protect the waters they call home.",

		"description": "Fall isn't just marked by the calendar. Each September, Earth's subtle tilt brings the autumn equinox—one of two times a year when day and night are nearly equal in length. It marks the beginning of fall in the Northern Hemisphere. From solar alignments to changing leaves, nature offers its own quiet signals that the season has shifted. While for most of us it may seem like just another day, ancient cultures paid close attention to this change. Sites like Chichén Itzá in Mexico and England's Stonehenge were designed to align with the rising or setting sun during equinox days.\nOne of the best places to catch the change in season? Fishlake National Forest in Utah, United States. As September rolls in, the aspen trees seen in today's image begin their annual transformation, turning vivid shades of yellow that ripple across the hills. The forest covers almost 5,960 square kilometres of lakes, trails and mountains that shine with fall colour. There's something grounding about watching the season change in sync with something much older than the Gregorian calendar we follow.",

		"description": "Spot a flash of yellow on its chest and a bill that looks painted by an artist—that's the keel-billed toucan. A member of the Ramphastidae family, which includes toucan barbets, it is one of more than 40 toucan species. Found from southern Mexico to northern Colombia, it spends much of its day plucking fruit with a rainbow-coloured bill about one-third of its total length. It also eats insects, eggs and small reptiles when available. The bill not only helps it eat but also keeps the toucan cool by radiating excess heat—thanks to the blood vessels running through it. This social bird often moves in small groups, chattering and gliding between treetops. With each wing measuring around 17-20 centimetres, the keel-billed toucan moults, or sheds its feathers, just once a year.\nWhen the breeding season arrives, a pair claims a tree cavity. The female lays two to four eggs, and both parents share incubation duty. The chicks hatch featherless, with closed eyes and tiny, pale bills. Over the weeks, their colours emerge, and they begin taking short flights. So, if you catch a glimpse of one, remember: it's more than a pretty face—it's a smart, social and well-equipped rainforest multitasker.",

		"description": "Somewhere in the wide prairies of northeastern Wyoming, United States, stands Devils Tower, a stone formation that rises from the open plains. Once called Bear Lodge, the butte gained its current name during an 1875 expedition led by Colonel Richard Irving Dodge, possibly after an interpreter mistranslated a Native phrase as 'Bad God's Tower.' The missing apostrophe in its official title follows standard geographic naming conventions—hence, the signs read 'Devils Tower.'\nAs you approach Devils Tower, every curve in the road unveils a new view—whether you're arriving from the highway, winding toward the visitor centre, or following the Tower Trail on foot. The site's significance stretches far deeper than its dramatic geology. For centuries, numerous tribes from the Great Plains and Black Hills, including the Arapaho, Crow and Cheyenne, have been linked to this place. Each tribe preserves oral traditions about the Tower's creation. While many of these accounts share recurring themes, the details remain unique to every community. Devils Tower continues to embody a living chronicle of geology, heritage and the ever-changing relationship between humans and the natural world.",

This fort has a circumference of about 13 kilometres and a maximum length of 5 kilometres. It is reached by a steep, zigzag ascent of just over 1 kilometre from the plains, beginning with a limestone bridge over the Gambhiri River.

With survival smarts and turbo-charged feet, this tiny rodent proves that being 'least' is no reason to squirrel away your potential. Weighing less than a deck of cards and measuring under 25 centimetres from nose to tail, this species is North America's smallest chipmunk.\nWhen it's not sprinting up logs or vanishing into leaf piles, it is stuffing its face—literally. Its expandable cheek pouches help it haul seeds, berries and insects to storage spots. Come winter, it doesn't fully hibernate. Instead, it enters a light torpor, waking every so often for a snack. Not one for group living, each least chipmunk carves out its own territory every summer, usually with a hidden burrow and a backup food cache or ten. But if a predator wanders too close, you'll hear chip-chip-chip alarms sounding off.\nDid you know that a least chipmunk's memory is so sharp that it can remember the locations of hundreds of food caches, even after a long winter nap?

This tree isn't just a pretty face—its sap is a key ingredient in Canada's famous maple syrup. Most syrup, however, comes from sugar maples, though black maples and red maples also contribute. Curious how? In spring, taps collect sap when nights are still freezing and days begin to warm. Boil it down, and what's left is the sweet syrup you drizzle on pancakes. Canada produces more than 70% of global maple syrup, with Quebec leading production.\nAs for those fiery leaves, that's anthocyanins at work—pigments that appear when green chlorophyll fades in cooler weather. Maple trees are also a source of hardwood for furniture, flooring and musical instruments. And no, it is not over yet. Canada's national symbol, the maple leaf, inspired Toronto's hockey team, the Maple Leafs. Spotted these trees on one of the series you binged?

This tiny Italian town is perched above the Val d'Orcia, surrounded by rolling hills that look exactly like you think Tuscany should: cypress trees, winding dirt roads, the occasional sheep. It's peaceful. And then you step inside the town walls, and it gets clever.\nPienza was once a regular medieval village called Corsignano. That is, until one of its sons became Pope Pius II and decided to transform his hometown. He hired architect Bernardo Rossellino and rebuilt the area based on Renaissance ideals of symmetry, order and harmony. The result? A site that feels intentional. The central square, Piazza Pio II, is flanked by a cathedral, a papal palace and a town hall, all arranged just so. Moreover, Pienza is known for pecorino cheese—sheep's milk aged in interesting ways. And once a year, the whole town turns into a cheese arena for Fiera del Cacio, a festival featuring Cacio al Fuso—a game where people roll wheels of cheese at a target.",

Often misnamed 'koala bears,' these marsupials are actually closer to wombats and tend to be instantly recognisable by their stout, tailless bodies, fluffy ears and velvety black noses.\nTheir diet is notoriously selective—koalas feed almost exclusively on certain eucalyptus leaves laced with toxins that most animals can't digest. To survive, they sleep up to 20 hours a day while a specialised, bacteria-rich gut works to neutralise the poison. This slow-motion lifestyle is nature's masterstroke of adaptation.\nYet their future hangs in the balance. From habitat loss, disease and climate-driven threats like bushfires, koalas are at a critical crossroads. But forest restoration, dedicated sanctuaries and Indigenous-led conservation are beginning to turn the tide. With continued care, these gentle climbers can cling to the treetops (and to our hearts) as enduring symbols of Australia's wild spirit for generations to come.",

Almost a century later, in 1970, the same date saw Fiji raise its own flag and declare independence. Fiji Day is a unique national holiday—part reflection, part celebration. The day begins with formal ceremonies, where the Fijian flag is hoisted and leaders deliver speeches. Schools and community groups often stage reenactments and performances. Streets fill with parades, villages host cultural dances like the meke and rugby pitches come alive with matches. Families prepare traditional dishes like lovo, where meat and root crops are cooked underground, and kokoda, a citrus-marinated fish dish.\nToday, the spirit of freedom stretches from bustling towns to remote gems like the island of Monuriki, pictured here. Known worldwide as the filming site of 'Cast Away,' the island is uninhabited—but far from lifeless. Its surrounding coral reef acts as a natural fortress, protecting the island from storms while sheltering countless species of fish. The reefs of Fiji are a fitting metaphor: strong, diverse and deeply connected to the well-being of the nation.",

		"description": "Birds don't bother with passports, visas or luggage—they just spread their wings and go. Twice a year, billions of migratory birds crisscross the globe, flying thousands of kilometres between breeding and wintering grounds. That epic commute is exactly what World Migratory Bird Day highlights. From the Arctic tern, which logs about 71,000 kilometres a year, to the tiny ruby-throated hummingbird crossing the Gulf of Mexico in a single flight, these seasonal fliers show what endurance really looks like. Observed on the second Saturday in May and October, the day also draws attention to the challenges migratory birds face: habitat loss, climate change and light pollution can all disrupt their routes.\nAmong the travellers worth spotlighting is the wood duck, pictured here. This North American species has made quite a comeback after once facing steep population declines due to hunting and habitat loss. Thanks to conservation efforts and nest box programmes, they are now a regular sight in wooded swamps, marshes and lakes. While some wood ducks stay put year-round in the southern United States, northern hens migrate south when the chill sets in, heading for milder regions stretching from the southern states to Mexico.",

Despite its name, this village isn't directly on the Saranac Lakes themselves but rather on Lake Flower, a wide section of the Saranac River. For centuries, the area—nicknamed 'The Capital of the Adirondacks'—was used by Indigenous peoples for hunting and travel. By the late 19th century, it gained fame as a health retreat, where Dr. Edward Livingston Trudeau pioneered fresh-air treatment for tuberculosis. The cure cottages from that era still stand today.\nToday, Saranac Lake has shifted from curing patients to curing boredom. Visitors paddle the waterways, hike the High Peaks and enjoy winter activities like skiing and ice fishing. The village also boasts a lively arts scene, with galleries, music and community festivals making culture as central as the outdoors. Local shops and restaurants add flavour, serving everything from trout to craft beer. The annual Winter Carnival is a highlight, complete with an ice palace that looks like something out of a frosty fairy tale, proving this village knows how to make a cool impression—literally.",

Long before it became official in 1879, explorers and settlers held feasts for safe journeys and full larders. The first nationwide Thanksgiving was once celebrated in November. Today, it's a three-day weekend of family dinners, walks, counting blessings and quiet reflection before winter.\nTurkey and pumpkin pie still headline the meal, but regional twists abound: butter tarts in Ontario, smoked salmon in British Columbia and tourtière, a spiced meat pie, in Quebec. Across the country, football games and community food drives are as traditional as dessert.\nStep outside, and those blessings multiply. Algonquin Provincial Park, three hours from Ottawa, has drawn nature lovers since 1893. Black bears roam, loons call across the water and wolves sometimes howl at night. Ever spotted a moose up close? Thanksgiving weekend is ideal for wildlife viewing, as animals are busy preparing for the cold. Hiking trails crunch with fallen leaves.

This village has appeared in films like 'The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants' and 'Tomb Raider,' thanks to its Cycladic houses—cube-shaped homes with flat roofs—and cliffside views that feel almost unreal. Its unique architecture has roots in the late 19th century. Sailors and merchants carved houses right into the volcanic cliffs—cool in summer and warm in winter. The white-and-blue theme is also more than just for show: houses were painted with lime wash so rainwater would run off and be collected. Today, visitors wander its cobbled lanes, explore the Naval Maritime Museum or climb to the ruins of Agios Nikolaos Castle for unforgettable sunsets.\nNicknamed the 'Eagle's Nest,' Oia overlooks the volcanic islets of Palia and Nea Kameni, as well as Therasia, which was physically connected to Santorini before the Minoan eruption. And Santorini itself? Think of it as a crown of rock around the sea, a half-sunken caldera shaped by the eruption of 1600 BCE, one of the largest volcanic eruptions in human history.",

Also known as the amethyst deceiver, its bright purple colour is dazzling when young, but it fades with age and weathering, making it tricky to identify. Despite its delicate, ever-changing appearance, this jewel-toned fungus is edible and plays a vital role in the ecosystem.\nFar more than pizza toppings or sautéed sides, these organisms are ecological powerhouses, essential for healthy forests. They break down dead matter, recycle nutrients and support tree growth through underground networks called mycorrhizae. Some also help store carbon in the soil, playing a role in climate regulation. National Mushroom Day encourages curiosity. So, try a new mushroom recipe today, read about how they support our planet or enjoy a foraging adventure.

With its tufted ears and a piercing gaze, this feline is the largest of the four lynx species. Stretching up to more than 100 centimetres in length and standing around 75 centimetres at the shoulder, the Eurasian lynx is built for power and precision. Its padded paws aren't just for sneaking; they act like snowshoes, spreading its weight so it can chase down prey in deep winter drifts. Mostly a nocturnal hunter, it spends its days tucked away in thickets or rocky dens, venturing out under the cover of darkness to stalk deer, hares and squirrels.\nThe lynx lives a solitary life. Males and females carve out their own territories, marking them with scratches and scent—like secret notes left in the forest. Their elusive nature did not protect them from humans: during the 1970s and '80s, thousands of lynx pelts were exported from Russia and China, pushing populations toward dangerous lows. Though fur trade restrictions have eased the pressure, poaching, habitat loss and shrinking prey numbers still pose threats today.",

Jasper Dark Sky Festival kicks off today and runs through 26 October, marking its 15th anniversary. Imagine being guided by astronomers using telescopes, watching a space-themed movie under the stars wrapped in a cosy blanket, hearing stories about nebulae and meteor showers, night hiking on Pyramid Beach or learning how to photograph the Milky Way.\nJasper Dark Sky Festival began modestly under Parks Canada and was later handed over to Tourism Jasper in 2013, when its reach expanded and big names like astronaut Chris Hadfield started participating. In doing so, it has become a highlight of autumn for all who want to gaze upward and tell stories in the dark.

However, it conceals a 4,500-year-old Neolithic enigma. Starting around 2400 BCE, chalk was locally quarried, transported and compacted by hand, layer by layer, over generations. The result is the tallest prehistoric mound in Europe, built entirely by human effort, rising to about 40 metres.\nWas it a ceremonial site, a cosmic marker, a symbol of community? Its original purpose remains elusive, and for archaeology, the questions can be as valuable as the answers. Where written records fail, the land tells its story. Silbury Hill preserves these tales, reminding us why studying our past matters: it rewrites what we thought we knew, amplifies silenced voices and shows us that history is never finished.",

Today's image captures that moment: branches heavy with ripe fruit, ready for harvest.\nThis land takes its apples seriously. The state apple, the Honeycrisp, now a world favourite, was born in the orchards of the University of Minnesota, where scientists have been cultivating apples for over a century. Throughout the autumn, families flock to orchards not only for the fruit but also for hayrides, cider pressing and the yearly ritual of choosing the perfect apple right from the tree.\nBehind the simple joy lies rigorous cultivation science: here, apple breeding has shaped varieties tough enough for harsh winters and sweet enough to rival any grown elsewhere.

International Sloth Day honours these unhurried creatures and reminds us that life doesn't always need to be rushed. Sloths are tree-dwelling mammals native to Central and South America. Their deliberate movements conserve energy, avoid predators and even allow algae to grow on their fur, creating green camouflage among the canopy. Hoffmann's two-toed sloth, pictured here, is a prime example of the slow-paced lifestyle typical of all sloths. It spends most of its time in the trees, occasionally descending to the ground to move to a new one.\nBeyond their charm, sloths play a crucial role in tropical forests. Their presence signals a healthy ecosystem, and protecting their habitats benefits various other species, including frogs and birds. Yet these gentle creatures face growing threats due to rainforest degradation. Organisations like the Sloth Conservation Foundation are working tirelessly to develop initiatives to preserve their habitats, ensuring that future generations can continue to marvel at these slow-moving icons of nature.",

Their thick coats and long tails are built for survival in freezing, rocky terrain. Yet even these stealthy cats can't hide from threats like poaching, shrinking habitats and climate change. With fewer than 7,000 left in the wild, conservation is a necessity. The image of a snow leopard mother sheltering her cubs in the rocky cliffs of the Cold Desert Biosphere Reserve in India illustrates what's at stake. That's why governments, conservation groups and local communities team up to safeguard both the animals and their ecosystems. After all, saving snow leopards also protects water sources and biodiversity for millions of people living downstream: they act as keystone species in their alpine environment, maintaining the ecological balance through predation on herbivores. That prevents overgrazing and protects vegetation that helps retain snowmelt and maintain watershed health.",

The tradition comes from an old Irish story about a man called Stingy Jack. According to legend, Jack tricked the Devil multiple times and was denied entry to both heaven and hell, leaving him to wander the Earth with only a carved-out turnip and a glowing coal to light his way. Immigrants brought the tale to North America, where pumpkins—larger and easier to carve than turnips—became the canvas for glowing jack-o'-lanterns.\nThe Connecticut field pumpkin is the go-to variety thanks to its size, smooth skin and bright orange hue. The colour of pumpkins comes from beta-carotene, but not all are orange—some grow white, green or even blue.

Observers have seen them pulling grubs from dung heaps and even forcing Verreaux's eagle-owls from their nests. Often seen in pairs or small groups, they build large stick nests on cliffs or tall trees, laying three to five bluish-green eggs. Their calls range from deep croaks to wheezy notes and rare instances of mimicry have been recorded. Their plumage gleams purple in sunlight, a striking figure of the African highlands.

		"description": "The Portuguese island of Madeira— about 965 kilometres southwest of mainland Portugal—hides a forest unlike any other. On its northern slopes lies Fanal Forest, where veils of mist drift through centuries-old til trees. These are part of the Laurissilva of Madeira—an outstanding relict of a once widespread laurel forest type. Laurissilva is the largest surviving area of its kind, with about 90% considered primary forest. Home to a unique array of plants and animals, including endemic species such as the Madeiran long-toed pigeon, it remains a living museum of natural history.\nIn Fanal, the gnarled, moss-draped trunks stand as guardians of this ancient heritage, where nature has preserved its vitality for centuries. Beyond the trails, these woods also offer quiet corners to pause and enjoy. Between scenic viewpoints, a leisure area with a public barbecue and even a winter lake born from an ancient crater, this is a place to be dazzled, to wander, to play—or simply to breathe and relax.",

Timed with the Hindu lunar month of Kartik, it usually takes place between late October and early November on the Gregorian calendar. This year, the celebrations stretch from today until November 5, marking the region's most anticipated season.\nWhat began as one of the world's largest camel and cattle markets has gradually transformed into a grand celebration of culture and community. Alongside the trading of cattle and camels, visitors now enjoy quirky competitions like 'matka phod' (pot breaking), longest moustache contest and even bridal shows. Rural families explore vibrant stalls overflowing with textiles, clothes and glittering bracelets, while the fair itself kicks off with a high-spirited camel race, followed by traditional songs, dances and lively performances. Among the highlights is the camel showcase, where participants take turns riding the animals in an animated display that adds to the festive charm. In recent years, the fair has introduced new attractions too, including a friendly football match between the local Pushkar Club and teams of foreign tourists.",

		"description": "Knock, knock! Trick-or-treat? Halloween is here, bringing a whirl of costumes, candies and carved pumpkins to porches across Canada. What began over 1,000 years ago as Samhain, a Gaelic harvest festival where people disguised themselves to scare off spirits, has become a night of playful scares. Tonight, streets come alive with people in costumes of every kind, from eerie classics to hilarious pop culture twists.\nEver wondered where trick-or-treat even came from? The practice grew from medieval mumming, in which people performed while in disguise in exchange for food or coins. In North America, the earliest known guising was witnessed in British Columbia in 1898, and the phrase 'trick or treat!' first appeared in Ontario in 1917. The 'treat' means sweets, but the 'trick' hints at harmless mischief if the bowls run empty.\nThe classic jack-o'-lantern, you ask? Well, it has its roots in Irish folklore, said to symbolise a soul trapped between worlds. Their carved faces have become a symbol of the season, marking the shift from autumn days to chilly nights. So, whether you're joining a costume contest, watching classic films or enjoying a slice of pumpkin pie, Halloween reminds us that make-believe never gets old.",

For over a decade, Polar Bears International—a non-profit organisation—has invited people to stream live cams and follow daily updates as the bears head to Hudson Bay. It's a week of learning and a call to protect a fragile ecosystem.\nThe town of Churchill takes centre stage. Each autumn, hundreds of polar bears gather near here, waiting for the bay to freeze so they can hunt seals again—their primary food source. Ever wonder how they stay warm? A thick layer of fat and a dense undercoat trap heat. Their tangle-resistant hairs shake dry after swimming, and natural oils stop the coat from freezing. Sadly, warmer temperatures delay that freeze, forcing the bears to fast longer. To cope with the delay, they rest, conserve energy and sometimes wander the area. Scientists track their movements to learn how migration patterns shift each year. Polar Bear Week celebrates these mammals while reminding us that their future depends on what we do about a warming planet.",

Old Town reflects that past with boardwalk cafés and galleries, while the Coquille River Lighthouse stands restored at Bullards Beach as a reminder of the days when its beacon guided ships.\nA short walk from the lighthouse leads to the beach where an evocative coastal landscape unfolds: Bandon's sea stacks, featured in today's image. Sculpted over millennia by waves, wind and the slow collapse of arches, these formations tell a geologic story. Face Rock resembles the tilted chin of a maiden from local legend. Nearby, Wizard's Hat rises like a pointed cap against the sky and Elephant Rock arches like a trunk reaching for the tide. Other notable shapes include Coquille Point, Table Rock and the Cat and Kittens stacks.

		"description": "On November 10, 47 years ago, a stark stretch of South Dakota prairie gained recognition as one of America's natural treasures. Badlands National Park, carved by wind and water, was redesignated from national monument to national park status in 1978, securing stronger protection within the United States' National Park System. Its cliffs and spires rise above fossil beds that reveal ancient rhinoceroses, camels and subtropical seas. Yet the park is not only a window into the past; it also safeguards one of the largest remaining tracts of mixed-grass prairie in the country.\nThe prairie hums with life. Bison roam the open range, bighorn sheep climb steep bluffs and prairie dogs build underground colonies, known as 'towns,' that can stretch for kilometres. Roberts Prairie Dog Town, where today's image was captured, is the park's largest accessible colony, supporting nearly 200 plant and animal species. Once labelled pests, prairie dogs are now recognised as keystone species, as they give rise to soil aeration and plant diversity. The park's anniversary marks its redesignation, but also reminds us that the Badlands endures not just as a rugged formation, but as a living and breathing prairie.",

		"description": "Of all the plants on Earth, the quiver tree looks the most like a vision from the future. Found in Southern Africa, including parts of Namibia, these striking giants are not true trees but a species of aloe adapted to life under the desert's scorching sun. Their thick trunks store water, while their branches reflect heat, helping them endure harsh conditions. Reaching up to 7 metres in height, with some living for more than 100 years, quiver trees are also vital to their ecosystem. They offer rare perches and nesting sites for birds in landscapes where few other trees exist.\nThe name 'quiver' comes from the Indigenous San people, who once hollowed out the branches to craft lightweight arrow holders, or quivers. The Quiver Tree Forest near Keetmanshoop is a national monument and one of Namibia's most photographed sites. With some of the clearest skies on Earth, the desert provides a perfect backdrop for stargazing. In today's image, quiver trees stand silhouetted against the Milky Way. Though climate shifts are altering their natural range, these trees remain a symbol of Namibia's rugged beauty—and a reminder of how nature adapts in the most imaginative ways.",

Commissioned by the Flavian emperor Vespasian in 72 CE and finished by his son Titus in 80 CE, this amphitheatre broke tradition with its predecessors that were built into hillsides for natural support. Instead, the Colosseum was a fully free-standing architectural giant. Crafted from stone and concrete, its arches and vaults supported an arena that could host up to 50,000 spectators. Gladiators, exotic animals and even staged sea battles thrilled the crowds, while hidden elevators and trapdoors created sudden, dramatic appearances.\nDuring the Middle Ages, the Colosseum found new purposes: first as a church, later as a fortress. Over the centuries, it endured damage from lightning strikes, earthquakes and pollution. Much of its marble and travertine was also reused in palaces, fortifications and even churches—a practice known as 'spolia,' which quite literally wove pieces of the structure into the evolving city of Rome. It wasn't until the 19th century that serious preservation began. Today, recognised as a protected monument and welcoming nearly 7 million visitors annually, the Colosseum remains one of Italy's most iconic landmarks.",

And that's the charm. They are found in the warm coastal waters of the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, the Amazon Basin and West Africa. They can weigh about 550 kilograms, yet their diet is strictly vegetarian. These whiskered mammals are slow swimmers in a fast-paced world. They cruise at around 8 kilometres per hour—great for relaxing, not so great when speedboats come charging through. That's why 'no-wake zones,' or sections of waterways with a strict speed limit, are there to keep manatees safe.\nDespite the 'sea cow' nickname, these marine animals are closer genetically to elephants than cattle. And like elephants, they're gentle giants with no interest in picking fights. Their biggest battles are against human-made threats: pollution, habitat loss and boat collisions. So, what can you do? Support conservation, spread the word and if you're boating in their waters, channel your inner manatee and take it slow.",

From late October to early November, maple reds, ginkgo golds and larch yellows spill down the slopes. The winding route also leads to some of Nikko's greatest hits. Climb up, and you'll reach the Akechidaira Plateau. Here, a ropeway gives you sweeping views of Lake Chuzenji and the powerful Kegon Falls. At the top, Lake Chuzenji offers a calm contrast to the dizzying drive, while the waterfall roars below. Centuries ago, pilgrims took this same route to reach sacred shrines and temples.

The traboules, a network of hidden passageways threading between courtyards and buildings, turn a simple stroll into a treasure hunt. They were the original shortcuts, allowing residents to dodge rain, carry goods or move discreetly through the medieval quarters. Today, they're less about practicality and more about discovery. These passages date back to the fourth century but became essential during the Renaissance, when silk traders used them to shuttle delicate fabrics safely from workshops to the river without braving the weather. Later, during World War II, Resistance fighters used the traboules as escape routes.\nMost of Lyon's traboules are tucked away in the Vieux Lyon and Croix-Rousse districts. Push open what looks like an ordinary wooden door, and you might step into a courtyard with spiral staircases, arched galleries and stone corridors that snake between buildings. Some passages are public, some private and all of them blur the line between indoors and outdoors. Walking a traboule is like flipping through the city's footnotes.

The red fox's story began in Eurasia about 400,000 years ago, and around 130,000 years ago, these creatures crossed into North America and found a permanent home.\nWith about 45 subspecies worldwide, the red fox is the largest species of fox found in Canada. This clever creature typically measures around a metre long and weighs 2.5–6.5 kilograms. Its intelligence is evident in its hunting techniques—such as pouncing through snow to catch hidden prey, or storing food for leaner times. Their thick fur keeps them warm in winter, and their bushy tail acts as both scarf and signal flag.

		"description": "Each autumn, the quiet waterways of Oregon, United States, become seasonal waypoints for hooded mergansers—small diving ducks native to North America. They are agile divers, plunging beneath the surface to catch fish and other prey. Males, known as drakes, stand out with their fan-shaped white crests, dark heads and chestnut-brown sides, while females, called hens, are brownish grey with smaller crests. Oregon's lakes and wetlands provide sheltered feeding grounds as these birds migrate or winter across the continent.\nAmong the six living merganser species, hooded mergansers are the second smallest. They are known for their striking courtship displays, where males raise their crests dramatically to attract mates, creating unmistakable shapes on still water. They nest in tree cavities near wetlands, and soon after hatching, ducklings leap to the ground to follow their mother to water. Classified as Least Concern on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List, their populations remain stable across their range. First described in 1758, their genus name, 'Lophodytes,' means 'crest diver' in Greek—a nod to both their plumage and underwater hunting skill.",

Completed in 1904, the building still dominates Budapest's skyline as a powerful national symbol.\nStep inside, and the richness deepens. Gold leaf shimmers across staircases and halls, while statues of rulers and national figures line the corridors, turning history into spectacle. Beyond its political role, the Parliament has become a cultural emblem—hosting state ceremonies, welcoming millions of visitors annually and earning UNESCO World Heritage status.

What began in 1954 as a UN initiative grew into a landmark observance anchored by two historic milestones: the 1959 Declaration and the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child. These commitments have carved a global promise—one that speaks of education, equality, safety and the simple right to be heard.\nToday, UNICEF and communities around the world carry this vision forward through campaigns, conversations and moments that encourage adults to pause—and truly listen to what children have to say.",

		"description": "This harbour seal, photographed at Robert Moses State Park on Long Island in New York, United States, seems to be onto something—spreading good vibes, one wave at a time. That's exactly the spirit of World Hello Day, celebrated every November 21. This cheerful observance began in 1973 when two American brothers, Brian and Michael McCormack, launched it as a peaceful response to global tensions. They mailed 1,360 letters in seven languages to world leaders, inviting them to join the first celebration. Their message was simple yet powerful: personal communication can help preserve peace. Today, people in more than 180 countries participate.\nSeals, it turns out, raise their flippers primarily for thermoregulation. But to us, it looks like they're saying 'hello,' making them the perfect mascots for the day. So, as you look at this waving seal, take its cue: say hello to someone new today—a neighbour, a coworker or even a passerby. One word might just make a ripple of peace across your own little sea.",

		"description": "There are big statues—and then there's the Leshan Giant Buddha. Carved into a riverside cliff at the confluence of the Min, Qingyi and Dadu Rivers in Sichuan, China, this statue is an ancient engineering marvel. Construction began in 713 CE under a monk named Hai Tong, who hoped that the Buddha's presence would calm dangerous river currents that threatened passing boats. He was so devoted that when funding ran out, he reportedly gouged out his own eyes to prove his sincerity. Construction took roughly 90 years and was completed long after Hai Tong's death. At 71 metres tall, it is the largest stone Buddha in the world. Its shoulders stretch about 28 metres wide, its ears measure nearly 7 metres long and each foot extends over 8 metres. Drainage channels built inside the statue protect it from erosion, helping explain its remarkable preservation for more than 12 centuries.\nTogether with the Mount Emei Scenic Area, the Leshan Giant Buddha became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Although time, weather and pollution have taken their toll, continuous conservation work ensures it remains one of China's most treasured cultural landmarks.",

Each new chamber is proportionally larger than the previous one, maintaining a consistent growth ratio, often associated with the Fibonacci sequence.\nEach November 23, we celebrate Fibonacci Day, named after the 13th-century Italian mathematician Leonardo Bonacci (Fibonacci), who introduced the concept to Europe. The pattern 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8…—where each number is the sum of the two before it—was, however, first described in India as early as 200 BCE by the ancient poet-mathematician Pingala. The Fibonacci sequence appears widely in nature, including pineapples, artichokes, pinecones and the arrangement of leaves on a stem.\nAmmonites were molluscs that lived between 400 and 66 million years ago, gliding through ancient seas inside coiled shells that protected their soft bodies. When ammonites perished, sediment buried their shells and minerals slowly turned them to stone, preserving this natural geometry for millions of years. Today, the ammonite fossil is a striking reminder that math and nature speak the same language.",

Nicknamed 'the Gibraltar of India,' this fort was praised by Mughal emperor Babur as the 'pearl among the fortresses of Hind' for its strength and grandeur. The fort has seen rulers from the Tomars to the Mughals and is linked to battles, royal intrigue and hidden treasures.\nThe fort has six palaces, two of which were built by Raja Man Singh Tomar, who reigned from 1486 to 1516. The architecture reflects a blend of Hindu and Mughal styles. Key landmarks include the Man Mandir Palace, with its turquoise-tiled exterior and the Sas-Bahu Temples, dedicated to Lord Aniruddha and Lord Shiva. Teli Temple, a rectangular shrine without pillared pavilions, stands out among other such structures. Secret passages and hidden vaults hint at treasures long rumoured to be stored inside.\nAs the sun sets behind the walls, a sound and light show brings the fort alive, narrating stories of kings, warriors and dynasties.

The name 'Trevi' comes from Tre Vie—'three roads'—signifying the junction where it stands. Designed by Italian architect Nicola Salvi and finished by Giuseppe Pannini, this 26 metres marvel is the largest Baroque fountain in the city and one of the most famous in the world. Its sculptures show Oceanus, the god of the sea, surrounded by Tritons and horses.\nVisitors come for the view but stay for the ritual: toss a coin over your left shoulder and make a wish. Legend says one coin guarantees a return to Rome, two bring love and three lead to marriage. Around CAN$4,200 to CAN$5,600 worth of coins are thrown daily—roughly CAN$2.1 million a year—all donated to charity.

Even when scarred or hollowed, their trunks still send out fresh leaves each season—a living record of survival through drought, wind and fire. In 2019, UNESCO established November 26 as World Olive Tree Day, recognising these trees that have been cultivated by humans since about 6,000 BCE. Olives have carried both practical and symbolic weight through the ages: their oil was pressed for anointing, medicine and daily sustenance; crowns of their leaves graced Olympic victors; and their branches became a lasting emblem of peace.\nNestled in the Balearic Sea, the Spanish island of Mallorca embodies this long story, flourishing with groves like those in the Serra de Tramuntana, photographed here. Some trees across the island are older than its medieval cathedrals. Here, olives are gently picked, pressed within hours and transformed into an oil prised for its fruity, almond and herbal notes. Each harvest continues a legacy: the fruit nourishes, the wood fuels fires and the roots stabilise steep slopes. Across millennia, these companions of civilisation have witnessed our progress as we witness their endurance—remaining unyielding, persistent and remarkably green.",

Opened in 1870, this Victorian marvel in East Sussex has survived tempests, fires and even wars. Stretching gracefully into the English Channel, the pier started life as a docking point for steamers. Over time, it evolved into a place where you can stroll above the water, lose a few coins to an arcade machine and gain a few back in memories.\nA severe storm in 1877 swept away the landward half of the pier, which was then rebuilt at a higher level on stilts that allowed it to flex and move slightly during rough weather. During the Second World War, sections of its decking were removed to mount machine guns for coastal defence. A 2014 fire that damaged part of the structure could have spelt the end. However, it was restored and reopened, bringing back its charm—complete with cafés, shops and the hum of seagulls. And beyond its resilience, the pier has found fame on screen too—it's appeared in TV favourites like 'Poirot,' 'A Place in the Sun,' and even 'Art Attack.'",

Yet red deer stags steal the show. Adult males weigh 160 to 240 kilograms and stand about 95 to 130 centimetres at the shoulder. They graze on grass, leaves and shoots, but also won't say no to fruit or acorns. During the rut, stags display their antlers and bellow to claim territory.

Leipzig's Christmas market began in 1458 and quickly became a favourite stop for merchants and locals alike. Today, with its cultural and culinary offerings spread across the historic old town and about 300 stalls, it is one of the largest Christmas markets in Germany. Imagine streets buzzing with the chatter of traders and children following the scent of 'Lebkuchen'—honey-sweetened cakes. This is where townsfolk gather to celebrate winter and catch up on news while sipping mulled wine. These markets have always symbolised more than shopping—they offer an escape from the everyday routine.\nAnd what is a Christmas market without Santa Claus? In Leipzig, his grand arrival is a tradition. On the Saturday before Advent Sunday, families welcome Santa and his entourage, who arrive on a special train at the main station. Every corner of this city tells a story: from the historic St. Thomas Church to the merry-go-rounds that have delighted children for generations.

The area gained fame when it co-hosted the 2010 Winter Olympics, and some of those venues are still open to the public today.

Outdoor ice-skating, snowshoe trails through quiet forests and guided cultural experiences offered by the Squamish Lil'wat Cultural Centre offer different ways to explore. Snow tubing at the family park near the gondolas is a cheerful break, especially as the light turns blue over the peaks.

Every sprint, hunt and instinct-driven movement of this iconic predator reflects the interconnected world around it: wetlands feeding migratory birds, forests sheltering elephants and grasslands sustaining countless species.

Its sky served as both compass and calendar, guiding celestial events and shaping temples, rituals and the rhythm of life. Around 426 CE, K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo', a warrior from the Maya heartland, founded Copán and established its royal dynasty.

The stairway rises in 63 carved steps covered with more than 2,000 glyphs—the longest Maya inscription ever found—recording reigns, ceremonies and ambitions that shaped the city's power. Altar Q, standing beside it, translates that history into sculpture, portraying 16 rulers in sequence, preserving the story of a dynasty in stone.

This subtropical wilderness supports hundreds of species, including alligators, manatees and the endangered Florida panther. In 1947, the United States established the Everglades National Park, protecting over 6,100 square kilometres and shifting conservation toward preserving entire ecosystems rather than isolated landmarks.\nSpider webs stretch between reeds, catching light in fine reflections, as seen in the image featured today. The park is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, yet its balance remains fragile: pollution, development and altered water flow still threaten its habitats. Major restoration efforts, including the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan, aim to restore natural water patterns, reduce pollution and limit urban expansion. Within this mosaic, over 350 bird species live, both American crocodiles and alligators share its waters and panthers move through its quiet corridors.

But unlike their domesticated relatives, they keep things wild. Found mainly in Argentina, Chile, Peru and Bolivia, they're built for life at high altitude. Their thick coats help them handle chilly winds, while their padded feet give them the grip to trek across rocky terrain that would make even mountain goats nervous.\nSocial creatures, guanacos usually hang out in herds—led by a dominant male who keeps a close eye on the group. Communication is key in their world. Spot a predator, and a guanaco will let out a sharp bleat that basically means, 'Run for it!' These wild wanderers also play an important ecological role. As grazers, they help maintain grassland balance, and their droppings enrich the soil, keeping Patagonia's ecosystem healthy. So today, while llamas bask in attention—decked out on mugs, memes and Christmas sweaters—take a moment to nod to their untamed kin.",

		"description": "The Mosque-Cathedral of Córdoba is a chronicle of Spain's layered history. It began as a church built by the Germanic Visigoths, before being transformed into a mosque in 784 CE by Abd al-Rahman I, founder of the Umayyad Emirate of Córdoba. Its vast hypostyle hall, a space supported by rows of columns, features the famous red-and-white arches shown here. Today, it contains more than 850 columns, many reused from Roman and earlier Visigothic structures.\nDuring the Christian Reconquista in the 13th century—a campaign spanning centuries to reclaim Iberian territories from Muslim rule—the mosque was converted into a Catholic cathedral. Later, a Renaissance nave was added, blending Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque styles with Islamic heritage. Today, this UNESCO World Heritage Site attracts millions of visitors fascinated by its unique fusion of art, faith and history. Despite centuries of modifications, the original mosque's geometric patterns and horseshoe arches remain largely intact, offering a glimpse into Córdoba's multicultural past. The Mosque-Cathedral serves as a remarkable story of coexistence, conquest and architectural brilliance.",

		"description": "Every December 11, we celebrate International Mountain Day, honouring the majestic peaks that shape our planet and the glaciers that support life. From the rolling Alps to the towering Himalayas, mountains cover nearly a quarter of Earth's land and host 15% of the world's population and nearly half of its biodiversity hotspots. Mount Everest, the world's highest peak at over 8,800 metres, stands as a symbol of human aspiration and natural beauty. Its glaciers feed rivers sustaining millions, showing that mountains are more than scenery—they are lifelines.\nGlaciers, holding about 70% of the world's freshwater, are melting rapidly due to rising global temperatures. This threatens agriculture, water security, energy production and the livelihoods of billions. Retreating glaciers and thawing permafrost also heighten hazards like floods, landslides and erosion, putting communities and infrastructure at risk.\nThis year, International Mountain Day is themed 'Glaciers matter for water, food and livelihoods in mountains and beyond,' which emphasises the urgent need to protect these vital ecosystems. Whether marvelling at Everest or hiking a local ridge, the day invites us to reconnect with Earth's vertical landscapes and recognise their essential role in life, climate and biodiversity.",

		"description": "Some bridges are feats of engineering; others feel more like an adventure. Vancouver's Capilano Suspension Bridge Park leans into both. The bridge spans almost 140 metres across the Capilano River and sits 70 metres above it, held by strong cables that give a gentle sway as you walk. The idea took shape in 1889, when Scottish civil engineer George Grant Mackay built the first version using hemp rope and cedar planks. Wire cables replaced the original materials in 1903, and the site slowly expanded into a popular outdoor spot cherished by many.\nVisitors often arrive for the seasonal light displays, which turn the walkways and trees into glowing corridors. The annual Canyon Lights event is the standout. From late November through mid-January, millions of small lights wrap around the bridge, the Cliffwalk and the Treetops Adventure high among the Douglas-fir trees. It feels festive, bright and a little surreal in the middle of winter.\nThe park also features in pop culture. In 2019, the Korean pop group NCT 127 filmed a video here during their world tour project 'NCT 127: The Origin.' Gamers might recognise it from Mario Kart Tour and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, where the bridge appears in the first lap of the 'Vancouver Velocity' track.",

For Yosemite National Park, in the United States, that stroke is the Merced River—painting reflections of granite cliffs, pine forests and waterfalls across its canvas. One of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers, this waterway begins high in the Sierra Nevada. It gathers meltwater and winds 233 kilometres west through Yosemite Valley into California's Central Valley.\nIts Spanish name, 'El Río de Nuestra Señora de la Merced,' translates to 'River of Our Lady of Mercy,' and suits it well: it offers both calm and chaos depending on the season. Spring turns the river into Yosemite's main act, as snowmelt sends torrents rushing beneath stone bridges and past roaring waterfalls like Vernal and Nevada Falls. Summer brings a gentler flow that attracts rafters and swimmers. Fall adds a hint of gold as leaves drift downstream, and winter slows everything to a reflective stillness. Interestingly, it feeds Lake McClure, where a ghost town rises when water levels drop in autumn and winter. Along its lower stretches once stood Merced Falls, a bustling mill town during the Gold Rush era, now lying quiet.",

		"description": "Each December, thousands swap wrapping paper for binoculars and step outside for a different kind of holiday tradition: the Christmas Bird Count. Started in 1900 by ornithologist Frank M. Chapman, the count offered a peaceful alternative to the Christmas 'side hunts,' where people competed to shoot the most animals. Chapman had a better idea: to count them instead. Over a century later, that simple shift has grown into the world's longest-running citizen-science project.\nBetween December 14 and January 5, birders across the Americas head into designated 24-kilometre count circles to record every bird they see or hear. They log species ranging from chickadees to hawks—and even tufted titmice (seen in today's image). In Canada, the count is jointly coordinated by Birds Canada and the Audubon Society, bringing together thousands of volunteers from coast to coast. From urban parks to quiet rural routes and snowy forests, Canadians bundle up to document winter bird populations. Their observations help track long-term trends—from shifting migration patterns to changes in species distribution linked to climate and habitat loss. For many, it's now a holiday ritual—a chance to step outside, support science and join a continent-wide tradition.",

		"description": "Have you ever wondered how canals changed the way cities developed? For thousands of years, people have built canals to transport goods, control water flow and connect places. From ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt to medieval Europe, they transformed cities like Venice and Bruges into trade hubs. The Netherlands took this even further—by the 17th century, they were designing waterways that shaped cities such as Amsterdam.\nIt's no wonder Amsterdam is nicknamed the 'Venice of the North.' The city's 96.5-kilometre-long network of canals forms part of the UNESCO-listed Canal District. Mostly flanked by roads on both sides, these routes are now used for tourism and recreation. In the centre of the city is the Spiegelgracht canal, seen in today's image. It is famous for its art galleries, antique shops and serene reflections that inspired its name, 'Mirror Canal.' As night falls, bridges and trees glow with festive lights, their reflections shimmering across the calm water. With Christmas just around the corner, these canals resemble glowing strings of history—proof that the past still shines bright in the present.",

Rooted in Scandinavian folklore, these tiny guardians watch over homes and farms, keeping families safe through long, dark winters. But there's a catch: treat them kindly, or they may play tricks. A warm bowl of porridge on Christmas Eve is their favourite reward. Said to bring luck and laughter, they might even befriend your garden gnomes, since they often resemble them.\nGnomes are also believed to possess deep knowledge of nature and the secrets of the earth, which explains their role as loyal protectors. Over time, these helpers have swapped their work clothes for red hats and festive charm, evolving into the Christmas gnomes we know today. Handmade with wool, felt and faux fur, they now fill Christmas markets with colour and character. Look closely and you'll notice no two are the same—some mischievous, others sweet, all with stories woven into every seam. So, the next time one catches your eye at a Christmas market, take it as a quiet offer of protection.",

These little acrobats stay busy collecting nuts, seeds and fungi—feasting on fresh finds in summer and on stored cones through winter.\nOnce common across Britain, their numbers have fallen sharply due to competition from grey squirrels and the spread of the squirrelpox virus. Today, these red squirrels are mostly found in northern England and Scotland, with refuges like Kielder and Harwood Forests in Northumberland helping sustain their populations.\nTheir bright fur and quick movements have made them favourites in art and children's tales—most famously in Beatrix Potter's 'The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin.' Spotting a red squirrel in the wild feels like seeing a classic winter illustration come to life—tiny paws, a twitching nose and a tail that seems to have a mind of its own.

That geometric marvel, crafted from paper and cardboard, soon came to symbolise the Star of Bethlehem and the spirit of Advent. By 1897, Pieter Verbeek, a former student of that school, began producing and selling them. His son Harry later continued the tradition, founding the Herrnhut Star Factory in 1925.\nFrom that humble beginning, the tradition spread across Europe and the world.

It is the shortest day and longest night of the year in the Northern Hemisphere, occurring around December 21 or 22. In the Southern Hemisphere, the same happens around June 21 or 22. It marks the moment when one of Earth's poles tilts farthest from the sun. From that instant, daylight slowly begins to lengthen again.\nThis celestial event has fascinated people since the Neolithic era. Sites like Newgrange in Ireland and Stonehenge in England were built to capture the solstice sunrise or sunset. In ancient Egypt, temples such as the Temple of Amun-Ra at Karnak and the Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut at Luxor were aligned with it. For the ancient Romans, December 25 marked the solstice, ushering in Saturnalia, a lively festival of revelry, feasts and gifts. Across cultures, the solstice has become a celebration of light's return. In Iran, Yalda Night honours the triumph of light over darkness, while in Scandinavia, St. Lucia's Day brightens winter with candlelit processions.\nThough science now explains the phenomenon, its symbolism endures—a reminder that even in the darkest moment of the year, the world is already turning back toward the light.",

Their hooves shrink in winter to expose a gripping rim, then expand in warmer months for better traction.\nStill not impressed? Consider this: reindeer don't have an internal clock. Instead, their melatonin—the hormone that regulates sleep—adjusts to light and darkness, helping them stay awake through endless nights of gift delivery. They carry Santa through the air, excel on land and move effortlessly through icy waters, thanks to their strong swimming skills.

Thin sheets fracture under shifting temperatures, then drift and stack as the wind presses them toward land. The result is a field of translucent blues and silvers, catching the light at sharp angles and making the water's edge appear sculpted rather than frozen.\nBeneath the surface, waves keep moving, pushing the slabs against one another as they scrape, ring and groan. The sounds rise and fall with the motion, turning the shoreline into a fleeting, shifting performance. These formations can appear suddenly and disappear just as quickly, changing with every gust and temperature dip.\nLake Superior's immense scale shapes this phenomenon. As the world's largest freshwater lake by surface area, spanning over 82,000 square kilometres, its depth, wind patterns and temperature swings set the stage for this winter display. Its Ojibwe name, 'Gichigami,' from the Indigenous people of the region, reflects its long-standing reputation as a 'great sea.'",

		"description": "One moment the canopy is still, and the next, a burst of black and white shoots through it like a living exclamation mark. That's the black-and-white ruffed lemur, a primate that doesn't shy away from announcing itself with raucous calls. Its coat comes in bold patches, and the thick ruff frames its face. Roughly 92% of the lemur's diet is fruit, with leaves, nectar, seeds and the occasional fungus making up the rest. When trees are heavy with figs and other seasonal offerings, this creature moves quickly through the dense forest. As it laps up nectar, pollen sticks to its snout, turning it into one of the habitat's most effective pollinators.\nMany people recognise lemurs from the animated movie 'Madagascar,' but the real animal faces a much harsher reality. This tree-dwelling species is critically endangered. It survives in increasingly fragmented forests where habitat loss remains a constant threat driven by deforestation and hunting. Still, conservation groups are working to safeguard what remains, hoping the lemur's morning calls continue to ring out through the treetops.",

		"description": "On a windswept plateau in eastern Türkiye, along the border with Armenia, the ruins of the ancient city of Ani rise from the landscape with striking clarity. A millennium ago, Ani was a thriving Armenian capital on a major Silk Road route, its fortifications and busy streets shaping trade and culture across the region. Today, the city is quiet, but its outline still carries the weight of its past.\nThe image shows the Church of St. Gregory, one of Ani's most striking survivors. Built from dark volcanic stone, its tall cylindrical tower stands over the plateau with the same precision that once defined the city. Ani was known as the 'City of 1,001 Churches,' and its architects pushed new ideas in arches, domes and facades that later influenced Gothic tradition. Even in ruin, the design remains deliberate and unmistakable.\nAni's decline unfolded through earthquakes, invasions and shifting trade routes, yet the city never fully disappeared. Archaeologists continue to find new details, and conservation work fights erosion and time. Walking here feels less like exploring a ruin and more like meeting a city determined to keep its story alive.",

		"description": "In Japan's colder months, there's a morning moment when stillness breaks—not with wind or footsteps, but with a bright, rolling call that sweeps across the water. Whooper swans have touched down. One loud whoop—and winter suddenly feels awake. These birds migrate from Siberia and the Russian Far East, choosing Japan as their seasonal home because its lakes offer what long-distance travellers crave: open water, steady food and a safe place to rest. One of their favourite destinations is Kotoku Pond in the Kantō region on Japan's largest island.\nWhooper swans make an impression from the start, with tall necks, white feathers and yellow-and-black bills. Add a call that carries kilometres, and they become impossible to miss. Families migrate together, keep close on the water and coordinate flights with those trumpet-like notes. At places like Kotoku Pond, dawn departures are the highlight. While in Japan, their diet is simple: grains, aquatic plants and grasses. Moreover, healthy wetlands attract them, and their return each winter signals that the ecosystem is thriving.",

The city likes a warm-up: the CN Tower testing its colours, the harbour breeze tuning itself, streetcars gliding as if they already know a celebration is on the way. On New Year's Eve, Toronto doesn't wait for midnight; it builds toward it, as crowds drift toward the waterfront for a front-row view of what's about to ignite. At Nathan Phillips Square, skates trace sparkling loops as the clock nears twelve. Down by Harbourfront, fireworks test their reflections on Lake Ontario before bursting into the sky.\nAcross Canada, the new year arrives with a mix of grit and warmth. Cities turn tranquil plazas into party grounds, complete with fireworks, concerts and quick sips of something hot. Families gather in parks, friends take over rooftops and someone—somewhere—always gets the countdown wrong. From Halifax's salty air to Vancouver's mountain silhouettes, the country braves the cold together and calls it a celebration. And when midnight hits, the country erupts—colour, sound, cheers, all rising at once. For a brief, brilliant stretch, Toronto glows its way into the new year—unified, loud and beautifully alive, as seen in today's image.",

Whether the new year greets you with biting cold or under a warm sun, take five extra minutes to stretch before diving into the 365 days ahead. Ever wondered why we have 365 days in a year? It's because the Gregorian calendar—introduced in 1582—is based on a solar year: the time it takes Earth to orbit the sun. The stars have our backs, but the plans we make for the months ahead are all on us.\nLet's start the year with a clean slate. Here are a few ideas for New Year's resolutions. Simple things like reading, taking nature walks or practicing mindfulness cost nothing and can really boost your quality of life. Or maybe you're dreaming bigger: moving abroad, taking up scuba diving or learning an endangered language? Take a deep breath—and perhaps sleep on it a little longer.",

		"description": "Seeing Venice from above is mesmerising, but this Italian gem's true magic lies within its walls and waterways. Founded in the 5th century on a cluster of islands in the Venetian Lagoon, the early settlement rose from marshland to become a maritime powerhouse. By the Middle Ages, it had evolved into a major hub for trade between Europe and the East, fuelling immense wealth and cultural growth. The city's grandeur shines through its Gothic palaces, Renaissance art and landmarks such as St. Mark's Basilica, the Doge's Palace and the Rialto Bridge.\nVenice is celebrated not only for its iconic architecture and interwoven canals but also for the brilliant minds who shaped its legacy. 'The Travels of Marco Polo' chronicles the adventures of the Venetian merchant and explorer, and Antonio Vivaldi—composer of 'The Four Seasons'—was also born here. The city has inspired timeless works, including Thomas Mann's 'Death in Venice,' Shakespeare's 'The Merchant of Venice' and 'Othello' and Henry James's novella 'The Aspern Papers.'\nToday, Venice balances historic charm with modern challenges—from preserving fragile architecture to managing tourism. Gondolas glide past centuries-old facades, while festivals like Carnevale keep traditions alive.",

		"description": "Our picture of the day takes us to the Swiss village of Lauterbrunnen, where the Staubbach Falls shimmers in the distance beyond a quiet alpine valley. This is the landscape a young traveller, J.R.R. Tolkien, crossed during a hiking trip in 1911, long before he became the storyteller behind 'The Lord of the Rings' and 'The Hobbit.' Its soaring cliffs, silver waterfalls and crisp mountain air left a lasting impression and are believed to have inspired his vision of Rivendell, the elven refuge hidden deep in Middle-earth.\nOn January 3—Tolkien's birthday—fans across the globe celebrate Tolkien Day, raising a toast at 9 PM to 'The Professor.' The tradition, started by The Tolkien Society in 1972, recalls both Frodo's toast to Bilbo and the writer's years at Oxford, where he spent a lifetime shaping modern fantasy—interweaving language, legend and moral courage into timeless tales. Today, admirers honour not just an author but a world-maker—one who showed that even the smallest journey can lead to greatness, and that wonder awaits, ever-present, just beyond the familiar.",

Rising over 1,700 metres and sitting roughly 35 kilometres northeast of Palmer, this peak towers over mile 75 of the Glenn Highway, a route famous for its dramatic scenery. Its slopes bear the marks of ancient glaciers, etched into ridges and valleys that seem tailor-made for adventure.\nThe Dena'ina name, Bashtl'ech' (black stone), speaks to its cultural roots, while its English name honours Al King, a prospector from Alaska's gold rush days. Today, hikers and climbers come for the challenge: steep ascents, unpredictable weather and views so sweeping they feel like a hard-earned reward. On clear days, the Matanuska Glacier glimmers in the distance, and wildflowers brighten the rocky terrain, reminding you that even Alaska's wilderness has a soft side. Pack layers and a sense of humour—the weather changes fast—but if you're lucky, standing atop Kings Mountain feels like shaking hands with the sky.",

Since 1926, its 150 square kilometres have supported research and monitored wildlife behaviour in their natural habitat. Located within the Sabi Sand Private Game Reserve, it is home to Africa's Big Five. Londolozi is part of a larger open system that connects with Kruger National Park, allowing animals such as elephants, rhinos, lions, leopards, zebras and many antelope species to move freely without fences holding them back.\nAmong the species frequently spotted are impalas—always moving, always alert. Their adaptable feeding habits help them shift between flowering plants, acacia pods, forbs and fruits as the seasons change. Their social structure is just as interesting: females and young gather in herds, while males compete for territories during the breeding season. Most young are born in early summer after a gestation period of six to seven months. Even though they're quick and agile, predators such as leopards, lions and cheetahs keep them on edge. Drought cycles and habitat pressure add to the challenges, so protected spaces like Londolozi make a meaningful difference in their long-term survival.",

The Greenland National Museum displays Inuit artefacts and the well-preserved Qilakitsoq mummies, offering a glimpse into the island's deep past. This city is also home to the world's only Arctic golf course. But it's not just the sights that define Nuuk—it's how people come together when the cold sets in.\nWinter brings short days and snowfall, yet the city buzzes with life. People head out for cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, boating or dog sledding along the fjords. Indoors, friends gather for 'kaffemik'—a cosy coffee-and-cake tradition with strong Greenlandic coffee topped with whipped cream.

		"description": "Today is a day that puts time into perspective. Old Rock Day highlights the vast geological processes that have shaped our world since its earliest eras. In Arches National Park, Utah, Turret Arch—seen through North Window—offers a striking reminder: landscapes can take hundreds of millions of years to assemble. The Entrada Sandstone that forms these arches began as shifting dunes and shallow seas long before erosion carved today's shapes. Even so, these formations are relatively young. Most rocks on Earth disappear over time because plate tectonics, erosion and volcanism continually recycle the crust. Only the planet's ancient continental shields preserve truly old material. Canada's Acasta Gneiss, about 4 billion years old, is the oldest known rock still rooted where it formed.\nOld Rock Day also remembers the pioneers of geology. Theophrastus and Pliny the Elder recorded early mineral studies, while Ulisse Aldrovandi helped establish the term 'geology' in 1603. One hundred fifty years later, William Smith drew the first geological map. And in 1785, James Hutton revealed the Earth's immense age, providing insights that continue to shape our understanding of the ground beneath our feet.",

Originally native to Europe and Asia, the common starling has spread across the globe.\nBrighton's West Pier in England may be a ruin but when starlings gather above it, the scene is anything but broken. Each evening in autumn and winter, thousands of these small birds twist and turn in the air. The spectacle is called murmuration, a term as musical as the sound of wings beating in unison. Scientists suggest the birds swoop and swirl to confuse predators, keep warm and share information about roosting spots. Whatever the reason, the result is a dance that has visitors gazing upwards, phones in hands, hoping to catch a glimpse before the flock settles for the night.",

These towering redwoods are the tallest trees on Earth—one here stretches about 80 metres, roughly the height of 43 people stacked head to toe. Most are 600–800 years old, and some have stood for over a millennium, yet they're still considered 'young' for a species that can live for 2,000 years.\nHow do they endure? Thick, fire-resistant bark and tannins ward off insects and disease, while their roots—though only 3 to 4 metres deep—spread outward up to 30 metres and interlock with neighbours for stability. Fog drifting in from the Pacific provides nearly 40% of their water during dry summers, and fallen trees recycle nutrients as 'nurse logs,' fuelling new life.

Sixty-six leaders signed the Proclamation of Independence, demanding an end to French and Spanish colonial rule and affirming the country's right to sovereignty. This manifesto, backed by Sultan Mohammed V, was presented not only to colonial authorities but also to representatives of the US, UK and the former Soviet Union—a signal that Morocco's struggle was part of a global call for self-determination. Though repression followed, the movement endured, and by 1956 Morocco achieved full independence, marking a turning point in North African history.\nToday, that spirit of resilience echoes in Chefchaouen, the 'Blue Pearl' of the Rif Mountains. Founded in the 15th century as a fortress against Portuguese incursions, the city later adopted its signature blue palette—a tradition some trace to Jewish influence and others to Andalusian roots.
