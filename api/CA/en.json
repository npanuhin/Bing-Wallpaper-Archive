		"description": "Put on your tartan and let the bagpipes play—it's St. Andrew's Day! Scotland's national day is a public holiday there—though not everyone takes the day off. A fisherman by trade, St. Andrew was one of Jesus' apostles and a key figure in Christianity. Though he never set foot in Scotland, his influence is immortalised in the country's Saltire flag, which is said to represent the cross on which he was martyred.\nBrought over by Scottish immigrants in Canada, this day reflects the connection between Scotland and Canada. The North British Society of Halifax, Nova Scotia (now known as the Scots Society), was the first group in what would become Canada to celebrate St. Andrew in 1768. Today, the occasion is marked by parades, concerts, storytelling sessions and cultural festivals in communities with strong Scottish ties, such as Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia. Food plays a central role in celebrations, too. Expect hearty servings of Scottish staples like haggis, neeps and tatties (mashed rutabaga and potatoes). To mark this day, we're visiting Kilchurn Castle, one of Scotland's historic landmarks, in the west of the country. Perched on the banks of Loch Awe, the fortress was built in the mid-15th century by Sir Colin Campbell.",

		"description": "Windswept cliffs, rugged beauty and dramatic ocean views—welcome to Land's End in Cornwall, England. Since ancient Greek times, when it was known as 'Belerion' or 'Place of the Sun' or in Arthurian legends about the lost land of Lyonesse, Land's End has always been a place of fascination. Land's End is the most south-westerly point on mainland Britain. It is famous for being the starting point or end of charity races which run the length of the island of Great Britain from Land's End to John O'Groats at Britain's north-easterly tip.\nThe first thing you'll notice about Land's End is the cliffs towering above the crashing waves. The sea carved these granite walls over millennia, creating a striking coastline in the United Kingdom. These cliffs are part of the South West Coast Path, a 1,010-kilometre trail popular among hikers that runs from Minehead in Somerset to Poole in Dorset. The Cornish Coastal Path, featured in today's image, is a section of this trail, and snow here is a rare occurrence because of Cornwall's mild coastal climate and proximity to the Atlantic Ocean. So, whether you're here to hike, relax or just stand at the frozen edge, Land's End is a memorable cliffhanger.",

The young leaves of these budding trees are significant to the Danish people, as they are harvested from April to May and used in cooking—particularly in salads. In the past, Europeans would often use the smooth bark of beech trees for writing texts. In fact, in the modern Dutch language, the term for 'book' directly translates as 'beech tree.' As the sun shines through the forest canopy, wild anemones brighten up the woodland with their white petals. These blooms, representing delicate beauty and sincerity, have even starred in masterpieces by artists such as Monet and Vincent van Gogh.",

The area that spreads across 511 square kilometres was recognised as a national park in 1970. The Nuu-chah-nulth First Nations of the region have walked these lands for centuries. Today, seven of the 15 Nuu-chah-nulth tribes have at least 22 small reserves within the park and nine bordering it. Another notable feature of the reserve is the Coastal Western Hemlock Biogeoclimatic Zone. This temperate forest terrain is home to several animal species such as black bears, Vancouver Island cougars and martens.\nThe Broken Group Islands, seen in today's image, are a collection of small islands and islets scattered across Barkley Sound.

They were hunted for their fur, and their 'nuisance' freshwater abodes were destroyed. However, these buck-toothed, paddle-tailed dam builders have been gaining new respect in recent years. These animals have beneficial effects not only on water quality but also on land. With their iron-coated orange incisors, beavers fell trees, diligently constructing not just homes but habitats. Their dams create life-sustaining wetlands for countless species. Meanwhile, their lodges are masterpieces of security and comfort, the entrance strategically submerged to deter predators and provide privacy. The rodents have no trouble getting in, as they can hold their breath for up to 15 minutes. So, 'woodn't' it be nice to give a shout-out to these creatures on International Beaver Day?",

These sandstone balls—a phenomenon known as concretions—formed over millions of years as sedimentary layers built up around a central core of sand and stone held together by mineral cement. Erosion gradually wore away the outer layers to expose the spherical shapes we see today. This created a fascinating spectacle that only appears at low tide. Concretions are rare, and there has been plenty of wild speculation about where they come from, with some believing them to be extraterrestrial debris while others wondering if they are dinosaur fossils.

Established in 1934, the park encompasses over 2,114 square kilometres of wilderness. The forests, which cover most of the park, are home to 1,500 species of flowering plants, 952 algae, 65 species of mammals and over 240 species of birds, making it an International Biosphere Reserve.\nCades Cove—seen in today's photo—is a valley within the Great Smoky Mountains National Park renowned for its stunning scenery and historic structures, including log cabins, barns and churches. While exploring the park, you can also visit historical areas like Roaring Fork, Cataloochee and Elkmont. If you wish to watch fireflies, then Elkmont is the place for you and if you are a geologist, there's something for you too: this park is home to late Precambrian rocks. So, set your spirit of adventure free and explore the timeless treasure: national parks!",

The seeds of this day were planted back in 1969 when Gaylord Nelson, the then-Wisconsin senator, witnessed events like the Cuyahoga River catching fire and the Santa Barbara oil spill and decided that the world needed an environmental initiative. A year later, the first Earth Day event was held. Now, it has grown into an annual event with more than a billion people in over 193 countries taking part.\nThis year, the campaign's focus is on plastics, which are a particularly serious form of pollution on land and in the oceans. Many species—including this green sea turtle—eat the plastic waste they find in the ocean, mistaking it for food. These same plastics pose an entanglement risk and can also break down to become microplastics. Every year some 25 million tonnes of plastic enter aquatic ecosystems. So, whether you're planting trees, cleaning up beaches or simply spreading the word, let's remember to promote sustainable living. After all, there's no planet B!",

Despite their small size, Adélie penguins are sleek swimmers and can dive as deep as 175 metres in search of shrimp-like krill or fish. They are social animals which gather in small colonies for foraging, hunting and protection.

When observed from above, these round dwellings present an image of giant tyres or reels lying on their sides, with light walls, dark roofs and spacious interiors.\nHistorically, these buildings were communal living spaces and defensive zones for Hakka clans. The structures exemplified principles of equality and unity, with uniformly sized and shaped family areas, fostering a sense of community.

Mother's Day gives us a moment to embrace the warmth they generously offer. In today's image, we see a guanaco mother and baby, relatives of the llama, roaming the vast grasslands of La Pampa, Argentina. Just like a human mom, a guanaco female is fiercely protective of her child, also known as 'chulengo.'\nDid you know that the modern Mother's Day originated in the US in the early 20th century? It came about thanks to the efforts of Anna Jarvis, daughter of Ann Jarvis, a social activist. Jarvis was the one who organised the first Mother's Day service of worship and celebration. On this day, people express gratitude towards their mothers by giving gifts and cards, baking cakes and posting on social media. Well, how about writing a letter to your mother?",

The longest river in the country—the Fish River—has carved out the continent's largest canyon over millions of years. Winding through weathered layers of gneiss and dolomite rocks, the Fish River Canyon is around 160 kilometres long and about 548 metres deep. This popular site attracts adventure seekers with its hiking trail, which runs for 90 kilometres and the Fish River Canyon Ultra Marathon. Moreover, with Hartmann's mountain zebras, klipspringers and Eastern rock elephant shrews, the canyon is teeming with creatures big and small. So, whether you are there for hiking, trekking, camping or just soaking in the scenery, one thing's for sure: Fish River Canyon is a catch you won't soon forget.",

The cobblestone streets and absence of cars make it ideal for walking around. While here, you might want to visit the Chapel of Santa Marta and the Sanctuary of Madonna di Reggio.

We can enjoy the year-round presence of these birds in Canada since they can withstand cooler climates and are able to slow down their metabolism, a state known as torpor. Anna's hummingbirds, weighing less than a loonie, have a wingspan of 12 centimetres. They can beat their wings over 40-50 times per second, enabling them to hover and even fly backwards with ease.\nDuring their courtship, the males exhibit a remarkable performance. They embark on dives, making squeaky sounds to impress their mates. They fly skyward up to 40 metres before plummeting at a breakneck speed of roughly 3 kilometres per hour, emitting a sonic 'whoosh' with their tail feathers. During breeding season, the female builds a round nest of 3-5 centimetres in diameter, where she raises her young alone. So, the next time you're outside, keep an eye—and ear—out for Anna's hummingbird.",

Thanks to Polish-American scientist Leszek Sibiliski's initiative, the United Nations declared June 3 World Bicycle Day in 2018.\nKarl von Drais, a German inventor, is credited with developing the first two-wheeler, the 'swiftwalker,' in 1817. The machine certainly needed some further thinking, since the wooden frame and wheels didn't have pedals. The modern versions of bikes were developed in the late 1800s, but the materials used for them are still constantly evolving to make the ride easier and more secure.

The day was June 6, 1944, a date forever etched in time as D-Day. It marked the launch of Operation Overlord, the ambitious Allied invasion that became a turning point in World War II. The audacious assault by sea, air and land involved nearly 160,000 troops.\nToday, on this 80th anniversary, we are featuring Les Braves, a sculpture that pays tribute to the courageous troops who landed here. One such symbol is Les Braves, a sculpture gracing Omaha Beach. French artist Anilore Banon's design features three sections called 'Wings of Hope', 'Rise, Freedom!' and 'Wings of Fraternity'.

These gargantuan water bodies, after all, teem with wonders, from the tiniest plankton to the grandest whales like the humpbacks we see here. The oceans also produce almost half of the oxygen on our planet thanks to the photosynthesis of plankton—tiny plants, algae and bacteria. Moreover, they absorb a significant amount of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, helping mitigate the impacts of climate change caused by human activities.\nOceans face many threats, including rising sea temperatures thanks to global warming, plastic pollution and ocean acidification, which threatens many marine species.

The Registan Square is encircled by three Islamic schools, namely the Ulugh Beg Madrasah, the Sher-Dor Madrasah and the Tilya-Kori Madrasah, characterised by the Islamic architectural style, which typically features elaborate repetitive patterns and ornamental forms.

		"description": "Cultural opulence, bustling economy and spirited locals—welcome to Dhaka in Bangladesh! This megacity on the Ganges Delta, home to over 10.2 million people, is one of the most densely populated cities on the planet. Once known as Jahangirnagar after ruling emperor Jahangir, Dhaka was the provincial capital of the Mughal Empire for 75 years in total. Dhaka has been nicknamed 'City of Mosques' because of the hundreds of elegant minarets that dot the city.\nHere, the cheers from football and cricket stadiums fill the air, and rickshaws, painted with colourful floral patterns, meander through the streets. UNESCO has even recognised the city's rickshaw art as the intangible cultural heritage of humanity. Watch out though, even if you're travelling in a stylishly painted rickshaw, it might take you a while to reach your destination: Dhaka has been recognised as the world's slowest city! Whether you're weaving through its alleys on a rickshaw or sampling its spicy street foods, Dhaka is sure to move you, quite literally! Dhaka awaits with open arms and a steaming cup of tea.",

		"description": "You might have seen lakes with some unique colours before, but the Indonesian island of Flores, with its volcano Kelimutu, may steal the show. Home to three lakes, each with its own hue and folklore, this natural wonder attracts travellers seeking an otherworldly experience. Volcanic vents deep within the Earth release steam and gas, which alter the lakes' mineral compositions, causing reactions that transform their appearance periodically.\nEach lake at Kelimutu has its own unique chemical makeup, which is why they can be different colours from each other at the same time and these colours can change independently. The westernmost lake, Tiwu Ata Bupu (Lake of Old People), normally has a blue hue. Meanwhile, Tiwu Ko'o Fai Nuwa Muri (Lake of Young Men and Maidens) tends to be green and Tiwu Ata Polo (Bewitched or Enchanted Lake) is usually red. The local Lio people revere these lakes, believing them to be the resting place of souls. So, why settle for the usual beachside vacation when you can explore a trio of colour-changing lakes?",

It is likely they practised hunting and performed religious ceremonies in this area. If you are a history buff, you might want to try and decode the cryptic messages carved on the rock faces.

Cardinalfish can grow up to 8 centimetres and have tiny shimmery bodies with black vertical stripes and white-edged fins, which help them disguise. Unlike some finned creatures that migrate long distances, these pint-sized fish inhabit a small world, rarely straying far from their local reefs.\nEach young cardinalfish begins life being guarded by their fathers, who carry the eggs in their mouths for up to 30 days to shield them from the aquatic perils. Within these jaws, young fish embark on a silent metamorphosis, soon to emerge, ready to explore the currents. In their early stages, they form dense schools for protection against predators and hide among the spines of sea urchins and anemones. The diet of these opportunistic feeders primarily consists of small fish, crustaceans and plankton. Their existence whispers tales of resilience—a creature to cherish and protect for the spectacle of life it presents.",

More than just a church, this Gothic structure, with its red-tiled dome, is steeped in centuries of history. Built over an older cathedral dedicated to Santa Reparata, construction began in 1296 under the supervision of architect Arnolfo di Cambio. Filippo Brunelleschi, an Italian architect and designer, engineered its dome, which is the largest brick dome ever constructed. It was built without the support of traditional wooden frameworks; its completion in 1436 was the final stage of the cathedral's construction.\nIt's not just the outside that dazzles; inside there are artistic treasures to discover, from Giorgio Vasari's fresco 'The Last Judgement' to Paolo Uccello's intricate clock face. The cathedral complex is also home to the Baptistery, a small basilica and Giotto's Campanile, a free-standing bell tower. Step inside and you're walking on history—every visit gives a glimpse of the past and a demonstration of human potential.",

At the time, homosexuality was illegal, and raids against LGBTQIA+ establishments were common. However, on that night, the patrons of the Stonewall Inn, fed up with the continued harassment, decided to stand their ground. Violence escalated, leading to clashes between protesters and police. In the following days, there was more rioting as people gathered to protest the raids.\nOn June 28 the following year, gay pride marches were held in New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago to mark the anniversary of the riots. Similar marches soon started to be held annually in hundreds of places across the US and the rest of the world. June 28 is now celebrated as International LGBTQIA+ Pride Day. In 2016, the Stonewall Inn, Christopher Park and several nearby streets were officially dedicated as the Stonewall National Monument. So, today is the perfect time to remember those who have fought for LGBTQIA+ rights before, during and after Stonewall.",

Within its glass and granite façade, the gallery houses a collection of over 93,000 artworks, including masterpieces of Canadian and Indigenous art, European classics and more.

Its most emblematic feature is the amphitheatre, seen in today's image. One of the largest in the Roman Empire, it could accommodate up to 25,000 spectators, more than double the city's population. Beyond this, there are remains of impressive public buildings, a temple built in honour of Trajan, baths and villas decorated with stunning mosaics.

But don't be fooled by their names; meerkats are not cats. They're small carnivores of the mongoose family, native to the deserts and grasslands of southwestern Africa. Meerkats are highly social animals, living in tight-knit groups called mobs, which can consist of up to 30 individuals. These groups are a cooperative effort, with meerkats foraging together, grooming each other, babysitting and taking turns as sentinels to watch for predators. These critters create extensive burrows where they spend the night and retreat to escape the midday heat–meerkats love their afternoon siesta.\nWorld Meerkat Day, founded at Taronga Western Plains Zoo in Australia on July 3, 2018, is celebrated all over the world. This day aims to raise awareness about meerkats and their ecological importance. Classed as 'least concern' on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species, these tiny mammals are vital for controlling insect populations in their desert habitats.

There are three types of rock: igneous are formed from solidified magma and lava; sedimentary rocks are layers of sedimentary particles such as sand; and metamorphic rocks are the result of heat and pressure on other kinds of rock.\nToday's image takes us to Cappadocia in central Türkiye, and its stony structures known as fairy chimneys. These cone-shaped pillars are made of tuff, a sedimentary rock that forms as volcanic ash and debris accumulates. On the sides of the rocks, ancient residents of the area carved homes and churches. The area is also famous for its underground cities, which were cut out of the tuff to provide shelter and safety. This is just one of the many uses for rocks that humans have come up with throughout history.",

Japan is made up of 14,125 islands and has 29,751 kilometres of coastline, so it's no wonder the sea plays such a key role in national life. As well as providing much of the country's food, the seas that surround Japan are vital for trading and communicating with other nations.\nTo celebrate this day, many people take a trip to the beach. Another Marine Day tradition is to give something back to the ocean by throwing mudballs into the water; these balls are packed with microorganisms that help to purify the sea. Today's image takes us to Tateishi Park in Yokosuka. This scenic spot has stunning views of Sagami Bay and Mount Fuji, making it the perfect place to celebrate Japan's coastal waters on Marine Day.",

This landscape houses a treasure trove of fossils dating back over 75 million years, offering scientists and visitors a glimpse into the Late Cretaceous period.\nThe first fossil discovered in this park was of an Albertosaurus in 1884, which led to an excavation that uncovered approximately 500 species, including the fossils of Tyrannosaurus rex and Centrosaurus. The sediments exposed in the badlands, seen in today's image, have been around for over 1.5 million years.

The growth of Rothenburg ob der Tauber slowed in the 17th century, preserving its original character. Pictured here is Burgtor or the castle gate, which was built after the original Rothenburg Castle was destroyed by an earthquake in 1356.\nWithin the castle gate is an 'eye-of-the-needle' door, designed to be the only way in and out of the castle when the main gates closed at night. But Rothenburg's magic isn't confined to its walls. It's also a gateway to the 460-kilometre Romantic Road that runs from Würzburg to Füssen, covering Bavaria's castle-studded valleys.

Running from July 15 to 21, Coral Reef Awareness Week is the perfect time to honour them. Coral reefs are formed by tiny marine organisms called coral polyps, which create vast colonies that serve as homes to a diverse array of marine species. As we turn our attention to their beauty and benefits, it's vital to recognise the lurking threats–climate change, pollution and harmful human activities.\nPictured here is Mayotte, a paradise beneath the Indian Ocean's surface. This French Island boasts one of the world's largest and deepest lagoons, encircled by a coral reef of nearly 160 kilometres long. Mayotte's lagoon is home to over 250 species of coral and over 3,500 marine species. But it is facing numerous threats, including overfishing and coral bleaching, where corals expel the algae that live in their tissues, leading to a loss of colour and essential energy sources. So, this week, let's pledge to preserve coral reefs like this one. Dive in, because every splash counts.",

Jaguars arrived in the Americas some 2 million years ago, migrating from Eurasia through the Bering Strait. Today, they inhabit diverse habitats, from the woodlands of the southwestern United States to the rainforests of northern Argentina.\nOften found near bodies of water, jaguars are excellent swimmers, ambushing prey by leaping into the water. True carnivores, jaguars rely exclusively on meat for their nutritional needs. They feed on a wide range of animals, including deer, armadillos, monkeys and lizards. Their strong teeth and jaws can also bite through turtle shells and crocodile heads. In the Brazilian Pantanal, a small population of jaguars primarily feeds on aquatic reptiles and fish. So, the next time you are on a jungle trail, keep your eyes peeled and your senses sharp–remember: every rustle of leaves could be a jaguar on the prowl!",

Initially celebrated as National Moon Day in the United States, the day was recognised globally by the United Nations in 2021. Human civilisations have gazed at the sky for millennia, contemplating the origins and mysteries of the moon. The advent of space exploration transformed the moon into the target of numerous missions.\nApollo 11, the pioneering space mission that first landed humans on the moon, was launched on July 16, 1969. It culminated in the astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin taking the first steps on the moon on July 20, 1969. Moon Day commemorates this historic event and serves as a reminder of the significant efforts required to launch the space program. Moon missions have found no signs of life, but it could be a future site for human colonisation. The discovery of water ice, especially in the dark craters at the poles, makes it more hospitable for potential settlers. So, until you have a chance to live there, keep dreaming under the same moon that has captivated humanity since time immemorial.",

Invented by the Indigenous peoples of Central and South America, hammocks were called 'Hamacas' and were originally woven for sleep and relaxation. Back then hammocks were made from the bark of trees, whereas now they can be made of various materials like cotton, nylon and canvas.\nHammocks come in different shapes and sizes, like Nicaraguan hammocks, which are usually made of woven material with a wooden spreader bar. These sleeping swings have sailed across oceans as sailor beds, swung from the trees as forest dwellers' bedrooms and nowadays, add a touch of chill to hip outdoor retreats. They have health benefits, too; gentle rocking can improve your sleep and even relieve stress. So go ahead, jump into a hammock, and let it gently sway your worries away for a while.",

It now offers refuge to diverse wildlife, like the mountain bluebird, elk, mule deer, white-tailed deer and Canadian goose. The park covers an area of 6,641 square kilometres.\nThe Canadian geese can be recognised by their black heads and white cheek patches, which are also known as 'chinstraps.' They are resilient travellers, enduring thousands of kilometres of migration, flying in a V-shaped formation. While in Banff National Park, you might come across geese teaching their goslings to navigate the waters. It is not just a park; it's a theatre where nature is on display.",

These limestone bridges, towering over a deep gorge, are named after three dragons: Tianlong (Sky Dragon), Qinglong (Azure Dragon) and Heilong (Black Dragon). Tianlong, standing at 235 metres, has a bridge-pier with maze-like caves in it. The Qinglong Bridge, which is 281 metres high, offers breathtaking views when the sun is out. Heilong Bridge is the widest of the three bridges at 193 metres and reaches a height of 223 metres. Visitors can explore the Wulong Karst National Geology Park and visit places like the Furong Cave, a 2,846-metre cave with huge limestone stalactites, which are mineral formations that hang from the ceiling. Standing beneath these magnificent natural bridges, you can't help but be humbled by the sheer power of time and nature.",

This event began in 1930 when Hallmark Cards founder Joyce Hall proposed it as a day for people to acknowledge their friends by sending greeting cards. From exchanging friendship bracelets to sharing social media posts and messages, Canadians have come up with their own special traditions to appreciate their pals.\nThis is a good day to reflect on the many ways friendship impacts our lives, much like the symbiotic relationship between the impala and the red-billed oxpecker, pictured here in South Africa. Both these animals get something out of this relationship: the oxpecker gets food by eating ticks from the impala's skin, while the impala gets to stay clean. This animal duo showcases nature's version of companionship. So, reach out to your friends to express gratitude and simply say, 'I appreciate you.'",

It was also treasured by the Romans for its healing and cleansing properties.\nLavender is planted during the spring season, reaching its peak bloom in July. It doesn't just look good, it smells great too, and is said to help people relax. The fragrant oil is a staple in wellness practices, including aromatherapy, where it's used for stress relief and is a valued ingredient in the perfume industry. This plant is also used in the kitchen, adding a floral touch to dishes and drinks. So, next time you feel stressed let a few drops of the lavender essential oil calm you down.",

The islet is all that remains of a volcano that erupted about 230,000 years ago. According to Hawaiian mythology, Pele the fire goddess was in love with a man named Mo'o. The trouble was that Mo'o was in love with another woman. Pele's revenge was typically violent: she cut her rival in two, her body becoming Molokini, while her head became Pu'u Olai, a cinder cone on Maui.\nMolokini Crater these days is a prime scuba and snorkelling destination; the islet's crescent shape protects divers from waves and currents, allowing them to enjoy the reef. This habitat is home to at least 250 species of fish, including black triggerfish and parrotfish, as well as 38 species of hard coral and some 100 species of algae. So, come on in, the water's lovely. Just be sure not to anger Pele.",

With piercing yellow eyes against a grey-brown face, spotted owlets are often seen when small birds spot them during the day and mob them. Once located, these primarily nocturnal owls will often stare down intruders, bob their heads and emit a loud 'chirurrr-chirurrr-chirurrr' screech, or what's sometimes described as laughter or chuckling.\nStanding around 21 centimetres tall, speckle-plumed spotted owlets can be found from Iran to Vietnam. This one was photographed in Bangkok, Thailand. They primarily eat insects and small mammals like bats and mice, which they often store to eat later when food is scarce. Spotted owlets are a remarkably resilient species that flourish in environments such as semi-deserts, rocky areas, forests, farmlands and urban areas. While they aren't endangered, the spotted owlet's population is thought to have declined in the last four years, perhaps owing to loss of habitat and increased urbanisation.",

One of the major challenges they face is the loss of their languages: it's estimated that of the 4,000 Indigenous languages in the world, around 2,600 are in danger of becoming extinct.\nIn the city of Cusco, Peru, the stone walls of Sacsayhuamán, seen in today's image, murmur tales of the mighty Inca civilisation. The Quechua word Sacsayhuamán means 'the place where the hawk is satisfied'. The citadel's walls, which extended over 540 metres, were built in the 15th century CE. The boulders used to make them were carved and placed without mortar. After the Inca Empire was defeated at a battle here in 1536, Sacsayhuamán was dismantled by the Spanish and the rest of the structure was covered in earth. It was rediscovered in 1934 when the site was excavated. On this day, let's learn the importance of preserving Indigenous cultures and wisdom, as we honour the Indigenous peoples.",

In 2009, the British Cave Research Association led an expedition to explore the site. It was then that they realised something incredible: it was the world's largest cave. How large, you ask? Hang Sơn Đoòng's main passage is 5 kilometres long, 150 metres wide and 200 metres high. That's tall enough to fit a 40-storey skyscraper! Inside, there is a 60-metre calcite barrier called the 'Great Wall of Vietnam' and stalagmites stretching as tall as 80 metres.\nIt even has its own weather system; clouds form inside the cave due to temperature differences between the cave air and the outside air. Moreover, a subterranean river links Hang Sơn Đoòng to the nearby Hang Thung cave, suggesting yet undiscovered depths.

Rockefeller Jr. The park is home to a virtually untouched ecosystem of plants and animals, such as grizzly bears, wolves, bison, moose and bald eagles.\nJust 16 kilometres south of Yellowstone National Park, the park's 64-kilometre-long Teton Range is one of North America's youngest mountain ranges. At less than 10 million years old, erosion has had little geological time to smooth the edges of the mountains, hence the Tetons' jagged peaks. Like its peaks, many of the park's lakes, including the 24-kilometre-long Jackson Lake, were carved out by glaciers hundreds of thousands of years ago.

Ocean City was a quiet fishing village until 1875, when the Atlantic Hotel opened its doors, marking the town's transformation into a burgeoning resort destination. Now, this coastal village is known among travellers from far and wide, including us Canadians seeking sunnier climes. The town's iconic four-kilometre-long boardwalk is lined with restaurants, shops and amusement parks. Pristine sandy beaches that stretch for 16 kilometres are perfect for sunbathing, beach volleyball or building sandcastles, and the ocean waters beckon for a refreshing swim. With plenty of adventure and a heritage deeply rooted in history, Ocean City is a charming retreat that draws visitors back time and again.",

Built between the 10th and 13th centuries, this remarkable site served as a Hindu temple dedicated to the god Shiva. It is on the rim of an extinct volcano, offering views of the surrounding paddy fields and the towering Dongrek Mountains of Cambodia in the distance.\nWith its earthen terraces, the promenade is one of the most striking features in this park filled with intricate stone carvings. Ahead of the promenade is the Phlab Phla, believed to be a bathing area used by royalty before entering the temple that we see here today. Next to it is a passage that stretches on for more than 150 metres, lined with sandstone pillars, which leads to the first of three naga (mythical serpent) bridges that symbolise the transition from the mortal realm to the divine. At the top, the beautifully preserved shrine showcases a wealth of religious motifs, including sculptures of Hindu stories. The annual festival of Phanom Rung, held in April, attracts many who gather to witness the sun's rays aligning with the 15 doorways of the temple and lighting up the inner sanctum.",

The region played a significant role in Maine's logging industry for more than 100 years, but towards the end of the 19th century, this activity began to decline. Efforts to preserve the landscape we see here today were spearheaded by philanthropist Roxanne Quimby. She and her foundation started purchasing land near Baxter State Park in 2001 and donated it to the US federal government in 2016, ensuring its preservation for future generations.\nKatahdin Woods and Waters' diverse ecosystem provides a home for a variety of fauna, including moose, black bear and Canada lynx, in addition to numerous bird species like bald eagle and wood duck. It offers many outdoor activities for visitors, such as hiking, canoeing and camping. The monument has some of the darkest skies in the country due to the lack of electrical lighting in its vast expanse, making it a great place for stargazing.",

These carnivorous creatures thrive in freshwater environments such as slow-moving rivers, lakes and seasonally flooded savannahs. From these waters, they hunt for birds, fish, turtles and occasionally big mammals. Black caimans play an important role in making sure ecosystems stay balanced by keeping their prey's populations under control.

In 1428, a major earthquake struck the area, which was felt in Barcelona more than 80 kilometres away.

These gentle giants have been around for more than 240 million years, but the first specimen was discovered off the coast of South Africa in the 1820s. As the world's largest fish, whale sharks can grow up to 12 metres, with one reaching a record 18.8 metre. Found in tropical oceans around the world, these filter feeders glide through the water, mouth wide open, straining plankton and small fish. Each pattern on their dotted, starry skin is as unique as a human fingerprint.\nSadly, the International Union for Conservation of Nature lists whale sharks as endangered due to overfishing, habitat loss and climate change. Amid adversity, there's hope, like in Cenderawasih Bay in Indonesia, a whale shark oasis that's pictured here. Here, these titans dine on the generosity of fishermen who feed them baitfish for luck, reflecting a unique bond between man and marine life.",

They feature a striking staircase formation, with a two-step cascade created by three layers of basalt.\nBefore these falls became the spot we know today, they had quite a journey. Spanish explorer Alvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca might have been the first European to see the falls. In 1907, businessman Domingo Ayarragaray saw the potential of this area and built a hotel and roads. The falls became such a sensation that they were designated as national parks in both countries—Argentina's Iguazu National Park in 1934 and Brazil's Iguaçu National Park in 1939.

Agile, adaptable and mostly nocturnal, it roams from dense forests to urban playgrounds.\nAt dusk, the red fox sets out on solitary hunts, producing 12 different ranges of vocalisations, from sharp barks to eerie howls. It deftly pursues a diet of rodents, birds and even fruits. An aspect of its interaction is the 'gekkering' it exhibits, a chatter-like sound used mostly in aggressive encounters. Its communication extends beyond sound; the red fox's tail serves as a signal flag to convey different messages to other foxes. It's a subtle and skilfully nuanced language that echoes through the wild.",

Dolphins are highly intelligent and can be found all over the world in oceans, rivers and estuaries. Despite being able to exist in an array of environments and water temperatures, dolphins are threatened by a variety of human activities, such as hunting, pollution and fishing. Hunting in particular led to the creation of World Dolphin Day in 2022 by Sea Shepherd Global, an international marine conservation group.\nThe pod of dolphins seen in today's image was photographed near Réunion, an island in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Madagascar. A wide variety of marine wildlife can be found year-round in Réunion's deeper waters, including many types of sharks, orcas, humpback whales, sea turtles and of course, dolphins. The island's warm, tropical climate is ideal for these creatures, and spinner, bottlenose and rough-toothed dolphins swim in the island's crystal-clear waters.",

With a height of 30 to 105 centimetres, wallabies have strong hind legs that help them take impressive leaps and serve as a defence against predators. During mating season, male wallabies engage in boxing bouts to show dominance in an attempt to grab females' attention. Social creatures, wallabies form small groups called 'mobs,' which provide safety and mutual grooming. Their playgrounds are forests that echo with the thudding of their hops as they navigate their home range with ease.",

		"description": "Autumn is in the air—officially. The September equinox marks the transition from the lush summer to the mellow fall in the Northern Hemisphere, while in the Southern Hemisphere, it signals the beginning of spring. The term 'equinox' is derived from Latin, meaning 'equal night.' During this moment, the Earth's axis is perpendicular to the sun, meaning it rises due east and sets due west, a rare moment of global balance. This balance occurs because the Earth's axis is neither tilted toward nor away from the sun.\nLet's explore Buttermere in England's Lake District which mirrors this equinox enchantment with its tranquil waters and storied shores in today's image. Here, a Norse leader, Jarl Buthar, once defied Norman conquests during the 12th century. Some people think Buttermere's name may come from Buthar, but the more likely explanation is the nearby dairy pastures; Buttermere literally means 'the lake by the dairy pastures.' The lake, approximately 2 kilometres long, is not only a National Trust treasure but also the perfect place to take a break from the hustle and let nature refresh your spirit.",

The otter featured in today's image was photographed in Prince William Sound, Alaska, United States. Sea otters are native to the northern and eastern coasts of the North Pacific Ocean. Weighing 14 to 45 kilograms, they're expert foragers, diving to the seabed to find food. These clever critters are smart as well as cute: they use rocks to crack open shellfish, making them one of the few animals that use tools. There used to be as many as 300,000 in the wild, but they were heavily hunted for almost two centuries, as their dense fur was highly prized.\nBy 1911, it is thought that only around 2,000 were left. Thankfully, an international hunting ban, conservation efforts and reintroduction programs have helped them rebound and they are now found in about two-thirds of their historic habitat. Today, the British Columbia sea otter population is not just surviving but flourishing, with numbers increasing each year. However, there is still a need for awareness as they face threats like oil spills, accidents and pollution. So, whenever you glimpse their fuzzy heads bobbing in the waves, remember, you're witnessing a story of nature's triumph.",

		"description": "There's a reason why famed American photographer Ansel Adams fell in love with Yosemite National Park: vistas like today's image of Half Dome. Located in central California's Sierra Nevada mountain range, the park has been a popular destination for artists, mountaineers, settlers and nature lovers since the mid-1800s. To preserve the area and protect it from logging and overgrazing by cattle, the US Congress designated Yosemite a national park on this day in 1890. It's one of the most visited parks in the United States, with annual attendance exceeding 3 million, and it's a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nAt almost 2,696 metres tall, Half Dome—named because it looks like a dome that's been cut in half—is only one of Yosemite's geological wonders. Other famous climbing destinations include El Capitan and Mount Lyell, which at 3,997 metres tall is the park's highest summit. Yosemite is also famous for its waterfalls and is home to giant sequoia trees, black bears, mountain lions and endangered Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep.",

On the banks of the Yamuna River in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India, this ivory-white marble mausoleum will certainly leave an impression. The Taj, seen in today's image, was commissioned in 1631 by Shah Jahan, the fifth Mughal emperor, to honour his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal. This tomb is the centrepiece of a huge complex, which also includes a mosque, a guest house and beautifully landscaped gardens surrounded by a grand wall. Laid out in a striking rectangular shape, the tomb is flanked by giant arches and alcoves that merge Indo-Islamic and Mughal architectural styles. This mausoleum draws inspiration from notable structures such as the Gur-e Amir in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, and Humayun's Tomb and Shah Jahan's Jama Masjid in Delhi.\nIt's also an incredible architectural feat, with the outer dome reaching around 44 metres and the inner one standing more than 24 metres.

Found in the Indo-Pacific region, including Indonesia, Australia and Okinawa in Japan, mototi octopuses are masters of disguise. They usually have a dull orange-cream-brown colour but when alarmed, they can quickly shift to striking maroon with white stripes along their body and arms. Also known as poison ocellate octopuses, these cephalopods are highly venomous.

These trees are the most widespread native species in North America, with Pando, located in Utah's Fishlake National Forest, being a massive quaking aspen grove. Their fall foliage is breathtaking, with their leaves turning a vibrant yellow that lights up the landscape, as seen in today's photo, which was taken near Marble, Colorado.\nAspens are not only beautiful but also biologically fascinating. They grow in large colonies that originate from a single root system, making them some of the largest living organisms on Earth. Each tree in the colony is genetically identical. When an aspen tree is cut down or damaged, the root system remains alive, allowing new shoots to emerge and grow, which helps create a resilient network that can survive harsh conditions, including wildfires. This species quickly colonises areas that have been recently burned down and can regenerate even after frequent fires. Closer to home. the Aspen parkland is an ecological region that —retches across 397,304 square kilometres, covering parts of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. Aspen trees are more than just a treat for the eyes; they are an example of nature's resilience.",

The bar-tailed godwit embarks on an 11,000-kilometre nonstop flight across the Pacific from Alaska to New Zealand. The tiny ruby-throated hummingbird, weighing less than a nickel, makes the trip across the Gulf of Mexico—a seemingly impossible feat for its size. Migratory birds navigate the globe, instinctively knowing when and where to move to exploit seasonal abundance. The Arctic tern outshines them all with its intercontinental journey from pole to pole, covering 30,000 kilometres. Their migration routes are passages created based on environmental cues.\nLet's take a moment to admire the vibrant plumage of the wood duck, photographed in Quebec, and featured here today. Wood ducks, like the one in today's image, nest in tree cavities close to water and sometimes take advantage of man-made boxes. During the breeding season, from February to April, you'll find the females laying 7–15 eggs. After breeding in the eastern and western United States and southern Canada, these ducks migrate southward in the fall to avoid harsh winter conditions.

Within the Alcázar, there are several courtyards lined with delicately carved columns. One of these is the Patio de las Doncellas, or Courtyard of the Maidens, pictured here today.\nIn the centre of this beautiful space is a pool, whose still waters provide reflections of not only the blue Andalucian sky above, but of the intricate latticework of the courtyard's arches. Look a little closer at these arches, and you'll see carved shells, Hands of Fatima—a symbol said to bring protection—plants and Arabic script. Behind the columns, the walls are decorated with colourful ceramic times decorated with geometric patterns. These tiles, known as 'azulejos,' are a hallmark of Andalusian decoration.

One of the most dramatic moments of the migration is the crossing of the Mara River. Thousands of wildebeests gather at the riverbank, aware that danger lurks beneath the surface—the crocodiles—not to mention the lions and leopards that patrol the banks. When the first wildebeest takes the plunge, it's a wild rush as the rest of the herd follows, creating a chaotic scene. Some make it across, while others become part of the food chain.

Sloths are mainly leaf eaters, although they also snack on fruits and tree sap to keep them going. To help them break down those tough, fibrous leaves, they have a special multi-chambered stomach. With their super slow metabolism, digestion takes its sweet time, and they don't need much food each day to get by. It's not just their stomachs that move at a leisurely pace; they're so slow-moving that algae often develop on their fur, giving a greenish tint, which handily also provides them camouflage.",

In today's image, we're transported to the George L. Smith State Park, which spans 6.61 square kilometres in Emanuel County, Georgia, United States. The park's centrepiece, seen in today's image, is a 1.67 square kilometre mill pond, a favourite spot for fishing and canoeing. Out of its waters grow pond cypress and bald cypress trees, two varieties that are native to the country. Winding through the park are over 11 kilometres of nature trails, leading visitors through sandy landscapes past a bird sanctuary and tortoise habitat.\nIn Canada, the yellow cypress primarily thrives in the coastal mountains of British Columbia, braving the alpine slopes and misty havens, where few other trees dare to grow. Scientifically known as Callitropsis nootkatensis, it is also called Nootka Cypress, named after the Nuu-chah-nulth people of Vancouver Island.",

Down an unassuming side street, there's a surprise waiting for you: a house of monsters. Welcome to the Palazzo Zuccari, a 16th-century palace where myths seem to come to life on its façade—grotesque faces swallow up its doors and windows. Federico Zuccari, who built the palace, was well-versed in monsters. His painting of the Last Judgement in Florence Cathedral and his illustrations of Dante's Inferno are replete with mythical beings.\nThe monster door originally led to the palazzo's garden because Zuccari enjoyed making his guests experience the contrast between the scary entrance and the beautiful serenity of the garden. These days, the door leads to the Bibliotheca Hertziana, a library specialising in Italian art history, from the Middle Ages to the modern day, which has occupied the site of the garden since 1912. If you're looking for more monstrous mouths in Rome, not far from the Palazzo Zuccari is the Bocca della Verità, an ancient Roman mask. According to legend, it will bite off any liar's hand that's placed in its mouth.",

It was once the site of an extravagant house built in the 1930s by Madame Antoinette Sherri, a flamboyant 1920s costume designer known for her lavish parties. Madame Sherri's dramatic arrivals in town, often in a chauffeur-driven Packard, draped in furs, became the talk of the locals. As her fortune declined, her 'castle' fell into disrepair and was vandalised. In 1959, she returned to find her property in ruins and never came back. A fire destroyed the house in 1963, leaving behind only the stone foundation, an iconic staircase and a large fireplace leading to a lone chimney.\nToday, the forest where her house once stood spans over 2 square kilometres and offers scenic hiking trails through woodlands, hemlock groves and peaceful brooks, a picturesque setting for outdoor enthusiasts. Managed by the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests, this area was named in honour of Madame Sherri, and it also includes trails that lead to the ruins of her former estate. So, while the house was originally separate from the forest, the two are now intricately entwined.",

Bodey, a prospector who discovered gold but tragically died in a blizzard before seeing the town's rise. When large deposits of gold were found there, it grew to nearly 10,000 residents, with saloons, dance halls and breweries lining its streets. But as the gold ran dry, so did the town's fortunes. The mines closed, the population dwindled and by 1915, the place was abandoned. Bodie's streets are now empty, its wooden buildings frozen in decay.\nToday, it is one of America's best-preserved ghost towns. Wandering through the streets, you can peer into dusty homes and storefronts and even find small artefacts like shards of china and square nails from the glory days. Legend has it that Bodie's ghosts fiercely guard the town and those who take souvenirs risk being cursed with bad luck. If that doesn't scare you, taking items home is against the park's rules. So, if you find yourself here, be sure to leave with nothing but memories—lest the town's spirits follow you home.",

The towering presence of Mont Blanc, seen in this image, has left an indelible mark on literature, most notably on Mary Shelley's 'Frankenstein.' The last Friday of October is Frankenstein Friday, honouring Shelley's literary genius and the fascinating creature born from her imagination. 'Frankenstein' was conceived during a ghost story challenge. In 1816, an 18-year-old Shelley, along with fellow writers Percy Bysshe Shelley, John Polidori and Lord Byron, spent a stormy summer in Switzerland. There, she penned the tale of Victor Frankenstein and the Creature. A pivotal scene in the novel takes place on a glacier near Mont Blanc, where Victor is confronted by his monstrous creation. This setting, with its surreal beauty and treacherous terrain, perfectly captures a sense of awe and terror.\n'Frankenstein,' also known as 'Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus,' was first published anonymously in 1818. Shelley's use of the epistolary form—a novel told through letters—and her blend of Gothic and early science fiction made 'Frankenstein' a timeless classic.",

In Canada, as Irish immigrants settled, abundant pumpkins became the ideal substitutes for the turnips and potatoes they had previously used to create lanterns. By hollowing out pumpkins and lighting them with candles, they transformed the gourds into flickering defences against evil spirits.\nThe image of a pumpkin field in Victoria, British Columbia, seen today, captures the essence of this season. Every year, from late September to October, the fields of Quebec and the farms of British Columbia are full of this orange fruit. Visitors often flock to these fields for the quintessential pumpkin-picking experience. These gourds become canvases for masterpieces, with ghoulish and whimsical displays adorning porches to welcome trick-or-treaters. As people gather to scoop, carve and light their pumpkins, they participate in a shared ritual that transcends cultures. Beyond their role as porch decorations, pumpkins fill pies and spice up lattes, adding an element to the season that many anticipate all year long. Once merely a fruit, the pumpkin now enjoys a revered place in Halloween celebrations.",

With its keen vision, eerie vocalisations and silent flight, this owl has historically been revered and feared. In folklore and mythology, owls were considered symbols of wisdom and omens of death. On Samhain, the Celtic precursor to Halloween, the owl was believed to be the kin of roaming spirits.\nThe owl in today's image is far more than a character in ghostly tales. Often called the 'tiger of the air,' the great horned owl, named for its signature feathers that look like horns, is one of the most fearsome and adaptable predators in the ornithological world. Primarily active at night, the owl has large, powerful talons that exert huge amounts of pressure, which it uses to grab prey like small rodents and skunks. It has incredible night vision, but its eyes are fixed, so it must turn its head a whopping 270 degrees to see everything. So, whether you hear it hooting from treetops or see it flying in the night, this owl proves that not all scary apparitions are supernatural.",

Positioned high on an extinct volcano, these fortress walls have seen wars, royal births, executions and plenty of other drama since the 11th century. What really sets it apart is its reputation as one of Scotland's most haunted spots. It's no surprise that with more than 1,000 years of history, some have reported ghost sightings.\nLegend has it that the Grey Lady, Janet Douglas, roams the castle's corridors. Also known as Lady Glamis, a noblewoman accused of witchcraft by King James V, she is believed to still lament her fiery execution in 1537. Others say the Grey Lady might be the ghost of Marie de Guise—mother of Mary, Queen of Scots—mourning her lost power amid the turmoil of religious reform. Then there's the Dung Man, a prisoner who attempted to escape in a wheelbarrow full of excrement. He died from the fall when the cart was emptied from the castle wall. The lost piper, who vanished into underground tunnels, continues to play a haunting melody beneath the city. In 2001, the shadowy figure of a man in a leather apron emerged during a paranormal research project, leaving volunteers with a chilling memory. Spooked yet?",

The Caribbean flamingo is the largest flamingo species in the Americas and the only one native to North America. These vibrant birds are typically found around brackish and saltwater areas, like marshes, estuaries and along coastlines. Because of their pink colour, they're often confused with roseate spoonbills. However, their long necks and bent bills distinguish them from other wading birds like the great blue heron and wood stork.",

Over time, Banff's boundaries expanded, and it became part of the Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks UNESCO World Heritage Site. Spanning over 6,600 square kilometres, this national park transforms into a snowy playground during the winter, attracting visitors eager for skiing, snowshoeing, curling, skijoring and wildlife tours that offer plenty to explore. Despite the cold, life thrives in the park: it's home to a variety of wildlife, including elk, grizzly bears, mountain goats and wolves. Lodgepole pines and spruces also stand resilient against harsh weather. Banff's flora and fauna are closely monitored, ensuring that this balance remains intact.",

The story of this otherworldly landscape starts 65 million years ago when a dry seabed stood here. Over time, geological forces warped and squeezed the land, twisting the sandstone into lumps and bumps. Later, wind and water carved out the arches, pinnacles, fins and balanced rocks that now stand in this area. The park has more than 2,000 natural stone arches, the highest concentration of these structures anywhere on Earth. In today's image, we can see two of them: Double Arch, as seen through Cove Arch. The larger arch of Double Arch spans 44 metres and is 34 metres tall, the tallest and second-longest of the park's arches.",

		"description": "Today, we're taking a look at the Great Lakes—Lake Superior, Lake Michigan, Lake Ontario, Lake Huron and Lake Erie—the five lakes that span the Canada–United States border. Together, they hold 21% of the world's fresh surface water. Of these, Lake Ontario, standing between the states of Ontaio and New York, has the smallest surface area and was named 'Ontario' by Europeans in 1641. Covering approximately 18,960 square kilometres, it has been an important waterway for centuries. By the 18th century, the lake had become a strategic hub for the fur trade, particularly during the French and Indian War and later the War of 1812. Today, historic forts like Fort Niagara and Fort Henry stand as reminders of these turbulent times near the lake.",

		"description": "In the heart of Paris stands one of the city's most enduring icons: Notre-Dame Cathedral. Built between the 12th and 13th centuries on the Île de la Cité—an island in the Seine—Notre-Dame has witnessed centuries of French history, from the Hundred Years' War to the French Revolution, and beyond. Although it was chosen by Napoleon as the site of his coronation as emperor in 1804, by the early 19th century, the cathedral was in a state of disrepair. However, one novel changed its fortunes: 'The Hunchback of Notre-Dame' by Victor Hugo. The popularity of this book helped encourage a restoration project that renewed the cathedral's former beauty.",

		"description": "Prick up your ears and stretch your neck—let's step into the world of guanacos. These creatures, part of the same family as camels, alpacas and llamas, are native to the rugged landscapes of South America. Standing around 110 centimetres tall and weighing up to 90 kilograms, guanacos travel in herds led by a dominant male, accompanied by females and their young. After a gestation period of around 11 months, females give birth to a single baby—known as a chulengo—which is able to stand and walk within an hour of birth. Their diet, consisting of grasses, shrubs and lichens, enables them to flourish in harsh, mountainous terrain. Guanaco's soft, warm fur—first introduced for textile use in the mid-1900s—is highly prized. It is used to create luxury fabrics and is valued second only to vicuña wool across the Americas.",

Founded by ornithologist Frank Chapman as an eco-friendly twist on holiday hunting parties, this annual event replaced shotguns with binoculars. Since then, it has become one of the world's longest-running citizen science projects. Every year from December 14 to January 5, volunteers of all ages and birding skill levels come together to survey designated areas called 'circles.' Each circle has a diameter of approximately 24 kilometres, and participants count every bird they see or hear within it. The result is a colossal snapshot of bird diversity, with data collected from over 2,500 locations each season. It's a serious effort to track changes in bird populations, providing valuable data for scientists working to protect vulnerable species.",

Well, legend has it that Lake Misurina, pictured here, in Italy's Dolomites, was born from the sorrow of a giant named Sorapis. At more than 1,740 metres above sea level, it is the largest natural lake in the Cadore region, with its perimeter stretching more than 2 kilometres. The area around the lake is known for its beneficial climate, especially for those with respiratory conditions. Its crystal-clear waters and surrounding hotels provide a perfect getaway for up to 500 visitors. The lake played a role in the 1956 Winter Olympics, where it hosted speed skating events on natural ice, and it has even been immortalised in a pop song by singer Claudio Baglioni. With astounding views, mythical roots and activities for every season, this lake may well be the Dolomites' most alluring reflection.",

One of the prettiest places in the Lofoten Islands of Norway, Reine is a fishing village with a population of around 300. A trading post since 1775, it has evolved from a commercial hub to become a sought-after tourist destination. The village's waterfront is lined with the traditional fishermen's cabins called rorbu or rorbuer, which are mostly red in colour, as seen in today's image. Once important to fishermen, these cabins have now become a popular pick for tourist rentals. In 1999, German painter Ingo Kühl set up a pop-up studio in a rorbu in Reine, where he painted scenes of the harbour framed by the towering mountain range. This village truly shines in winter, when you have the chance to see the northern lights twinkling in the night sky.",
