		"description": "Put on your tartan and let the bagpipes play—it's St Andrew's Day! Scotland's national day is a public holiday there—though not everyone takes the day off. A fisherman by trade, St Andrew—also the patron saint of several other countries including Greece, Barbados, Romania and Ukraine—was one of Jesus' apostles and a key figure in Christianity. Though he never set foot in Scotland, his influence is immortalised in the country's Saltire flag, which is said to represent the cross on which he was martyred.\nFestivities on St Andrew's Day range from traditional folk music to high-spirited cèilidhs—social gatherings that involve music, dancing and storytelling. Food plays a central role in celebrations, too. Expect hearty servings of Scottish staples like haggis, neeps and tatties (mashed rutabaga and potatoes), smoked salmon and oatcakes. The day also serves as a warm-up to Scotland's winter festivals, leading into Christmas, Hogmanay and Burns Night. To mark this day, we're visiting Kilchurn Castle, one of Scotland's historic landmarks, in the west of the country. Perched on the banks of Loch Awe, the fortress was built in the mid-15th century by Sir Colin Campbell. Though this castle now stands in ruins, it still offers a glimpse into the country's medieval past and the powerful Clan Campbell.",

		"description": "When it comes to ringing in the New Year, Scotland takes the cake—or perhaps the haggis, its national dish. From torchlight processions to street ceilidhs, Hogmanay is the New Year's Eve celebration that says, 'Why settle for one night of celebration when you can have three?' The term 'Hogmanay' has murky origins—some link it to the French 'hoguinané,' which means 'gala day,' others to Norse or Gaelic roots. But what it means today is clear: an unmissable celebration filled with fireworks, folk songs and feasting. This year, the festivities kicked off on December 29 with a dramatic torchlight procession.\nOn December 31, as the clock nears midnight, cities like Edinburgh and Glasgow gear up for their iconic countdowns. Fireworks illuminate the skies as seen in today's image, but the real magic happens when the crowd bursts into 'Auld Lang Syne'. No Hogmanay is complete without 'first-footing,' a tradition where the first person to step into your home after midnight brings good luck for the year ahead. Bonus points if the first-footer carries coal, shortbread or whisky—symbols of warmth, sustenance and cheer. In true Scottish fashion, the party doesn't end when the clock strikes twelve. January 1 sees loony dooks—brave souls plunging into icy waters to shake off the cobwebs—or perhaps last night's whisky. And while January 2 is a public holiday in Scotland, it's probably less about recovering and more about preparing for another year of unforgettable celebrations. Cheers—or as the Scots say, Slàinte!",

The young leaves of these budding trees are significant to the Danish people, as they are harvested from April to May and used in cooking—particularly in salads. In the past, Europeans would often use the smooth bark of beech trees for writings texts. In fact, in the modern Dutch language, the term for 'book' directly translates as 'beech tree.' As the sun shines through the forest canopy, wild anemones brighten up the woodland with their white petals. These blooms, representing delicate beauty and sincerity, have even starred in masterpieces by artists such as Monet and Vincent van Gogh.",

With their iron-coated orange incisors, beavers fell trees, diligently constructing not just homes but habitats. Their dams create life-sustaining wetlands for countless species. Meanwhile, their lodges are masterpieces of security and comfort, the entrance strategically submerged to deter predators and provide privacy. The rodents have no trouble getting in, as they can hold their breath for up to 15 minutes. So, 'woodn't' it be nice to give a shout-out to these creatures on International Beaver Day?",

These sandstone balls—a phenomenon known as concretions—formed over millions of years as sedimentary layers built up around a central core of sand and stone held together by mineral cements. Erosion gradually wore away the outer layers to expose the spherical shapes we see today. This created a fascinating spectacle that only appears at low tide. Concretions are rare and there has been plenty of wild speculation about where they come from, with some believing them to be extraterrestrial debris while others wondering if they are dinosaur fossils.

Lying on a narrow strip of land between two lochs, the site initially comprised 60 stones, although today only 36 remain. The exact purpose of the structure is still unknown; in 2008, an excavation project called the Ring of Brodgar Excavation was undertaken to try to learn more about the site, but the project has not yet reached any conclusive results.

		"description": "Lace up those sneakers, channel your inner Mo Farah and get ready to join the ranks of marathon legends. This year, the London Marathon is back in its usual spring spot! This second-largest annual race in the United Kingdom will see runners from all walks (or runs) of life come together to tackle the ultimate challenge: 26.2 miles of pure grit and determination. Starting off at one of the three start lines (blue, green and red) between Greenwich and Blackheath, runners weave their way through the streets of the capital city, passing historic landmarks like Tower Bridge and Buckingham Palace. Moreover, the London Marathon isn't just about personal glory; it's also about giving back. With millions of pounds raised for charity each year, every step these runners take helps make the world a better place.",

		"description": "Today is Earth Day—a day dedicated to celebrating the planet we call home and raising awareness of environmental problems. The seeds of this day were planted back in 1969 when Gaylord Nelson, the then-senator of Wisconsin, USA, witnessed events like the Cuyahoga River catching fire and the Santa Barbara oil spill and decided that the world needed an environmental initiative. A year later, the first Earth Day event was held. Now, it has grown into an annual event with more than a billion people in over 193 countries taking part.\nThis year, the campaign's focus is on plastics, which are a particularly serious form of pollution on land and in the oceans. Many species—including this green sea turtle—eat the plastic waste they find in the ocean, mistaking it for food. These same plastics pose an entanglement risk and can also break down to become microplastics. Every year some 25 million tonnes of plastic enter aquatic ecosystems. So, whether you're planting trees, cleaning up beaches or simply spreading the word, let's remember to promote sustainable living. After all, there's no planet B!",

Despite their small size, Adélie penguins are sleek swimmers and can dive as deep as 175 metres in search of shrimp-like krill or fish. They are social animals which gather in small colonies for foraging, hunting and protection.

When observed from above, these round dwellings present an image of giant tyres or reels lying on their sides, with light walls, dark roofs and spacious interiors.\nHistorically, these buildings were communal living spaces and defensive zones for Hakka clans. The structures exemplified principles of equality and unity, with uniformly sized and shaped family areas, fostering a sense of community.

Winding through weathered layers of gneiss and dolomite rocks, the Fish River Canyon is around 100 miles long and about 549 metres deep. This popular site attracts adventure seekers with its hiking trail, which runs for over 50 miles, and the Fish River Canyon Ultra Marathon. Moreover, with Hartmann's mountain zebras, klipspringers and Eastern rock elephant shrews, the canyon is teeming with creatures big and small. So, whether you are there for hiking, trekking, camping or just soaking in the scenery, one thing's for sure: Fish River Canyon is a catch you won't soon forget.",

Vernazza got its name from the indigenous wine, 'vernaccia,' meaning 'local' or 'ours.' One of the best-known monuments in the area is Doria Castle, built in the 15th century as a defensive fortress to protect the village from frequent pirate attacks. Thanks to the construction of the Genoa–La Spezia rail line in the 19th century, the village became more accessible by land. The cobblestone streets and absence of cars make it ideal for walking around. While here, you might want to visit the Chapel of Santa Marta and the Sanctuary of Madonna di Reggio.

		"description": "It's not just a name. Chestnut-headed bee-eaters really do spend their days swooping after stinging insects. As well as bees, they also feast on wasps, hornets and other bugs. The birds in today's image are in Bardia National Park in Nepal, but they're found across many other South Asian countries, from India and Bangladesh to Sri Lanka and Thailand. They catch their prey in mid-flight, returning to a perch where they can beat stinging insects to stun them, which makes them safe to eat. These birds are designed to hunt: their dazzling green plumage helps camouflage them in dappled jungle light, their curved beak is perfect for picking off insects with precision and their eyes can move individually, which makes them all the better for spotting bees.",

		"description": "Eighty years ago, on the beaches of Normandy, northern France, an event unfolded that would alter the course of history. The day was June 6, 1944, a date forever etched in time as D-Day. It marked the launch of Operation Overlord, the ambitious Allied invasion of western Europe that became a turning point in World War II. The audacious assault by sea, air and land involved nearly 160,000 troops mainly from the USA, Britain and Canada.\nToday, on this 80th anniversary, we are featuring Les Braves, a sculpture that pays tribute to the courageous troops who landed here. One such symbol is Les Braves, a sculpture gracing Omaha Beach. French artist Anilore Banon's design features three sections called 'Wings of Hope', 'Rise, Freedom!' and 'Wings of Fraternity'. In addition, across the ocean in Michigan, its twin, 'Les Braves II: At Water's Edge,' resonates with the same spirit at The War Memorial. These sister sculptures stand as guardians of memory, inviting a moment of silence from a world that benefitted from the bravest of the brave.",

This day is about honouring and protecting the world's oceans and serves as a reminder of the critical role oceans play in supporting life on Earth. These gargantuan water bodies, after all, teem with wonders, from the tiniest plankton to the grandest whales like the humpbacks we see here. The oceans also produce almost half of the oxygen on our planet thanks to the photosynthesis of plankton—tiny plants, algae and bacteria. Moreover, they absorb a significant amount of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, helping mitigate the impacts of climate change caused by human activities.\nOceans face many threats, including rising sea temperatures thanks to global warming, plastic pollution and ocean acidification, which threatens many marine species. The theme for this year's World Oceans Day is 'Awaken New Depths.' This motto encourages us to delve deeper into the ocean's complexities and take urgent actions to ensure that these fascinating, ocean-dwelling animals continue to grace our planet for generations to come.

Britain's fastest land mammals become a captivating sight, chasing and 'boxing' in the fields. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, these hares' tawny coat is perfect camouflage for the temperate, open landscapes they favour. Their diet of grasses and herbs, and in winter, twigs and bark, fuels their remarkable bursts of speed, essential for outrunning predators. Unlike their burrow-dwelling rabbit cousins, hares bear their young, known as leverets, above ground. From birth, these youngsters are on the move—furry, wide-eyed and precociously active.\nWhile listed as 'least concern' by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, experts warn that hare populations have been waning since the 1960s, largely due to intensive farming practices. As wanderers of the wide-open lands and protagonists in countless myths and works of art, European hares continue to leap through our cultural fabric and across our fields, embodying the wild and unpredictable spirit of nature itself.",

Moreover, gemsboks are adept runners, achieving speeds of up to 37 miles per hour. Their distinguishing trait is their notably elongated, straight horns. Although both genders possess these formidable defences, the females' horns tend to be slightly longer and sleeker while the males' horns are thicker with broader bases.

The square embodied the essence of the Timurid Renaissance, a period of cultural and intellectual revival, which spread throughout the Muslim world between the 14th and early 16th century CE.\nIn this grand square, citizens came together to hear royal proclamations, announced with resounding blasts from colossal copper pipes known as dzharchis. The Registan Square is encircled by three Islamic schools, namely the Ulugh Beg Madrasah, the Sher-Dor Madrasah and the Tilya-Kori Madrasah, characterised by the Islamic architectural style, which typically features elaborate repetitive patterns and ornamental forms. The influence of Registan's magnificence is seen everywhere, from the Safavid monuments of Persia to the Mughal buildings of India and Pakistan.

		"description": "As summer blooms in London, a centuries-old ceremony unfurls with pomp and pageantry—Trooping the Colour. The event marks the official birthday of the British sovereign in a tradition dating back to the 18th century. Trooping the Colour is deeply rooted in the practicalities of yore, where battlefield standards served as vital rallying symbols for soldiers.\nToday, the regiments of the Household Division, resplendent in their bearskin hats and scarlet tunics, perform this ritual with a Drummer's Call and the dignified slow march, imbuing their colours with the respect and reverence they deserve. These striking flags are then paraded, or 'trooped', before the monarch, a salute to the sovereign's connection to the armed forces. And then, there's the fly-past by the Royal Air Force, where aircraft from yesteryear and today roar over the Buckingham Palace, while the Royal Family watches from the balcony. The ritual is not just a London spectacle; it resonates within Commonwealth realms, each adding local flair. In Canada, it blends with the solemnity of Remembrance Day.

There are also great dads in the animal kingdom, like the foxy father seen in today's image. Female red foxes need to stay in their dens with their young after giving birth, so males spend their time going out to bring her food. When the pups are a little older, their father takes time to play with them, teaching them survival skills they'll need in later life, like hunting and scavenging. The foxes seen here are melanistic, a condition in animals that results in darker colouring.\nFather's Day dates back to the early 20th century. After hearing about the first Mother's Day celebrations, Sonora Smart Dodd of the US, the daughter of a widowed Civil War veteran who raised her and her five siblings, decided that fathers needed a similar day of celebration. However, the idea spread, and by the 1970s, Father's Day became officially recognised in many countries, including the UK.

		"description": "You might have seen lakes with some unique colours before, but Indonesian island of Flores, with its volcano Kelimutu, may steal the show. Home to three lakes, each with its own hue and folklore, this natural wonder attracts travellers seeking an otherworldly experience. Volcanic vents deep within the Earth release steam and gas, which alter the lakes' mineral compositions, causing reactions that transform their appearance periodically.\nEach lake at Kelimutu has its own unique chemical makeup, which is why they can be different colours from each other at the same time, and these colours can change independently. The westernmost lake, Tiwu Ata Bupu (Lake of Old People), normally has a blue hue. Meanwhile, Tiwu Ko'o Fai Nuwa Muri (Lake of Young Men and Maidens) tends to be green and Tiwu Ata Polo (Bewitched or Enchanted Lake) is usually red. The local Lio people revere these lakes, believing them to be the resting place of souls. So, why settle for the usual beachside vacation when you can explore a trio of colour-changing lakes?",

The park's highlight, Fire Wave, is a geological marvel that appears like a frozen wave with its red, pink and white stripes.\nIn the park, you will come across mysterious petroglyphs, rock carvings made by scratching on the rock's surface, left by the Ancestral Puebloans, who were farmers from the nearby Moapa Valley. It is likely they practiced hunting and performed religious ceremonies in this area. If you are a history buff, you might want to try and decode the cryptic messages carved on the rock faces. Well, put on your hiking shoes and get ready to wander, to wonder and to witness the Valley of Fire State Park.",

Cardinalfish can grow up to 8 centimetres and have tiny shimmery bodies with black vertical stripes and white-edged fins, which help them disguise. Unlike some finned creatures that migrate long distances, these pint-sized fish inhabit a small world, rarely straying far from their local reefs.\nEach young cardinalfish begins life being guarded by their fathers, who carry the eggs in their mouths for up to 30 days to shield them from the aquatic perils. Within these jaws, young fish embark on a silent metamorphosis, soon to emerge, ready to explore the currents. In their early stages, they form dense schools for protection against predators and hide among the spines of sea urchins and anemones. The diet of these opportunistic feeders primarily consists of small fish, crustaceans and plankton. Their existence whispers tales of resilience—a creature to cherish and protect for the spectacle of life it presents.",

More than just a church, this Gothic structure, with its red-tiled dome, is steeped in centuries of history. Built over an older cathedral dedicated to Santa Reparata, construction began in 1296 under the supervision of architect Arnolfo di Cambio.\nFilippo Brunelleschi, an Italian architect and designer, engineered its dome, which is the largest brick dome ever constructed. It was built without the support of traditional wooden frameworks; its completion in 1436 was the final stage of the cathedral's construction. It's not just the outside that dazzles; inside there are artistic treasures to discover, from Giorgio Vasari's fresco 'The Last Judgement' to Paolo Uccello's intricate clock face. The cathedral complex is also home to the Baptistery, a small basilica and Giotto's Campanile, a free-standing bell tower.

At the time, homosexuality was illegal, and raids against LGBTQIA+ establishments were common. However, on that night, the patrons of the Stonewall Inn, fed up with the continued harassment, decided to stand their ground. Violence escalated, leading to clashes between protesters and police. In the following days, there was more rioting as people gathered to protest the raids.\nOn June 28 the following year, gay pride marches were held in New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago to mark the anniversary of the riots. Similar marches soon started to be held annually in hundreds of places across the US and the rest of the world. June 28 is now celebrated as International LGBTQIA+ Pride Day. In 2016, the Stonewall Inn, Christopher Park and several nearby streets were officially dedicated as the Stonewall National Monument. So, today is the perfect time to remember those who have fought for LGBTQIA+ rights before, during and after Stonewall.",

In 1992, London first held EuroPride and bewitched a crowd of 100,000 with the message of love and equality. Fast forward to 2024, and Pride in London stands as the largest pride festival in the UK, with an incredible 1.5 million visitors estimated to have attended in recent years.\nFrom the activism of several gay liberation groups to the powerful statement made by the Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners in 1985, every step taken in the parade echoes the footsteps of those who marched before.

But don't be fooled by their names; meerkats are not cats. They're small carnivores of the mongoose family, native to the deserts and grasslands of southwestern Africa. Meerkats are highly social animals, living in tight-knit groups called mobs, which can consist of up to 30 individuals. These groups are a cooperative effort, with meerkats foraging together, grooming each other, babysitting and taking turns as sentinels to watch for predators. These critters create extensive burrows where they spend the night and retreat to escape the midday heat–meerkats love their afternoon siesta.\nWorld Meerkat Day, founded at Taronga Western Plains Zoo in Australia on July 3, 2018, is celebrated all over the world. This day aims to raise awareness about meerkats and their ecological importance. Classed as 'least concern' on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species, these tiny mammals are vital for controlling insect populations in their desert habitats. So, let's unite to spread the word, ensuring future generations continue to be captivated by these remarkable creatures!",

The city was the first Roman settlement on the Iberian Peninsula and played a significant role in the Romanisation of the region, then known as Hispania—today Spain. Italica flourished in the centuries following its founding, especially during the rule of Emperors Trajan and Hadrian, who were born there.\nThe ruins of Italica are the remains of a once-bustling urban centre. Its most emblematic feature is the amphitheatre, seen in today's image. One of the largest in the Roman Empire, it could accommodate up to 25,000 spectators, more than double the city's population. Beyond this, there are remains of impressive public buildings, a temple built in honour of Trajan, baths and villas decorated with stunning mosaics.

These resilient species, capable of surviving for at least 9 years in the wild and surpassing 10 years in captivity, face numerous threats in their environment. Predation from various sources, including badgers, coyotes, snakes and both feral and domesticated pets like cats and dogs, poses a constant danger to its survival. The burrowing owl exhibits remarkable adaptive behaviours, such as nesting and roosting in abandoned ground burrows of armadillos, prairie dogs or skunks. When confronted with danger, the owl retreats to these burrows and emits rattling and hissing sounds.",

Japan is made up of 14,125 islands and has over 18,400 miles of coastline, so it's no wonder the sea plays such a key role in national life. As well as providing much of the country's food, the seas that surround Japan are vital for trading and communicating with other nations.\nTo celebrate this day, many people take a trip to the beach. Another Marine Day tradition is to give something back to the ocean by throwing mudballs into the water; these balls are packed with microorganisms that help to purify the sea. Today's image takes us to Tateishi Park in Yokosuka. This scenic spot has stunning views of Sagami Bay and Mount Fuji, making it the perfect place to celebrate Japan's coastal waters on Marine Day.",

Since its inception in 1990, it has evolved into a two-week event. A clever shift from September to July has made it easier for archaeological buffs to explore summer digs and heritage wonders. This year's theme of 'Archaeology and Community' invites enthusiasts across the United Kingdom for an array of in-person and virtual events organised by heritage organisations, local societies and passionate individuals.\nImagine standing amid Skara Brae's ancient stone houses on Scotland's Orkney archipelago, pictured here, where Neolithic settlers thrived over 5,000 years ago. Exposed by an 1850 storm, this prehistoric marvel is dubbed the 'Scottish Pompeii' due to its astonishing preservation—older than Stonehenge and even the Great Pyramids. So, grab your trowel and get ready to dig deep into the incredible, storied past. Who knows what you'll discover!",

With origins as a self-ruling city, in the Middle Ages, this walled Bavarian town once flourished with 6,000 inhabitants, making it the Holy Roman Empire's second-largest city at the time. The growth of Rothenburg ob der Tauber, slowed in the 17th century, preserving its original character. Pictured here is Burgtor or the castle gate, which was built after the original Rothenburg Castle was destroyed by an earthquake in 1356.\nWithin the castle gate is an 'eye-of-the-needle' door, designed to be the only way in and out of the castle when the main gates closed at night. But Rothenburg's magic isn't confined to its walls. It's also a gateway to the 290-mile Romantic Road that runs from Würzburg to Füssen, covering Bavaria's castle-studded valleys. Upon return, things can get festive at the Käthe Wohlfahrt Christmas Village, a dream for holiday enthusiasts. So, 'burg' up for a medieval adventure.",

Running from July 15 to 21, Coral Reef Awareness Week is the perfect time to honour them. Coral reefs are formed by tiny marine organisms called coral polyps, which create vast colonies that serve as homes to a diverse array of marine species. As we turn our attention to their beauty and benefits, it's vital to recognise the lurking threats–climate change, pollution and harmful human activities.\nPictured here is Mayotte, a paradise beneath the Indian Ocean's surface. This French island boasts one of the world's largest and deepest lagoons, encircled by a coral reef of nearly 100 miles long. Mayotte's lagoon is home to over 250 species of coral and over 3,500 marine species. But it is facing numerous threats, including overfishing and coral bleaching, where corals expel the algae that live in their tissues, leading to a loss of colour and essential energy sources. So, this week, let's pledge to preserve coral reefs like this one. Dive in, because every splash counts.",

Jaguars arrived in the Americas some 2 million years ago, migrating from Eurasia through the Bering Strait. Today, they inhabit diverse habitats, from the woodlands of southwestern United States to the rainforests of northern Argentina.\nOften found near bodies of water, jaguars are excellent swimmers, ambushing prey by leaping into the water. True carnivores, jaguars rely exclusively on meat for their nutritional needs. They feed on a wide range of animals, including deer, armadillos, monkeys and lizards. Their strong teeth and jaws can also bite through turtle shells and crocodile heads. In the Brazilian Pantanal, a small population of jaguars primarily feeds on aquatic reptiles and fish. So, the next time you are on a jungle trail, keep your eyes peeled and your senses sharp–remember: every rustle of leaves could be a jaguar on the prowl!",

Initially celebrated as National Moon Day in the United States, the day was recognised globally by the United Nations in 2021. Human civilisations have gazed at the sky for millennia, contemplating the origins and mysteries of the moon. The advent of space exploration transformed the moon into the target of numerous missions.\nApollo 11, the pioneering space mission that first landed humans on the moon, was launched on July 16, 1969. It culminated in the astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin taking the first steps on the moon on July 20, 1969. Moon Day commemorates this historic event and serves as a reminder of the significant efforts required to launch the space programme. Moon missions have found no signs of life, but it could be a future site for human colonisation. The discovery of water ice, especially in the dark craters at the poles, makes it more hospitable for potential settlers. So, until you have a chance to live there, keep dreaming under the same moon that has captivated humanity since time immemorial.",

Tianlong, standing at 235 metres, has a bridge-pier with maze-like caves in it. The Qinglong Bridge, which is 281 metres high, offers breathtaking views when the sun is out. Heilong Bridge is the widest of the three bridges at 193 metres and reaches a height of 223 metres. Visitors can explore the Wulong Karst National Geology Park and visit places like the Furong Cave, a 2,846-metre cave with huge limestone stalactites, which are mineral formations that hang from the ceiling. Standing beneath these magnificent natural bridges, you can't help but be humbled by the sheer power of time and nature.",

		"description": "These medieval towers stand tall over San Gimignano, a small town near Siena in north central Italy. In the Middle Ages, a town grew up around a church dedicated to Saint Geminianus—San Gimignano in Italian. As well as being a popular stop for pilgrims on their way to Rome, the town prospered thanks to its trade in local Vernaccia wine and in saffron, which is grown in the nearby hills. However, when the Black Death struck in 1348, half the population was lost, slowing the town's development and preserving its medieval character to this day.\nSan Gimignano's most recognisable feature is its skyline, made up of 14 towers. These impressive structures were the result of a rivalry between two families, each competing to build the tallest tower-house. By the end of the medieval period, there were 72 towers in the town, although because of wars, other catastrophes and building projects, many were lost. Today, the tallest tower still standing is the Torre Grossa—'big tower' in Italian. Built in 1310, it stands at an incredible 54 metres. It's no wonder that the town is sometimes called the Manhattan of the Middle Ages.",

The islet is all that remains of a volcano that erupted about 230,000 years ago. According to Hawaiian mythology, Pele the fire goddess was in love with a man named Mo'o. The trouble was that Mo'o was in love with another woman. Pele's revenge was typically violent: she cut her rival in two, her body becoming Molokini, while her head became Pu'u Olai, a cinder cone on Maui.\nMolokini Crater these days is a prime scuba and snorkelling destination; the islet's crescent shape protects divers from waves and currents, allowing them to enjoy the reef, where visibility can reach up to 46 metres. This habitat is home to at least 250 species of fish, including black triggerfish and parrotfish, as well as 38 species of hard coral and some 100 species of algae. So, come on in, the water's lovely. Just be sure not to anger Pele.",

With piercing yellow eyes against a grey-brown face, spotted owlets are often seen when small birds spot them during the day and mob them. Once located, these primarily nocturnal owls will often stare down intruders, bob their heads and emit a loud 'chirurrr-chirurrr-chirurrr' screech, or what's sometimes described as laughter or chuckling.\nStanding around 20 centimetres tall, speckle-plumed spotted owlets can be found from Iran to Vietnam. This one was photographed in Bangkok, Thailand. They primarily eat insects and small mammals like bats and mice, which they often store to eat later when food is scarce. Spotted owlets are a remarkably resilient species that flourish in environments such as semi-deserts, rocky areas, forests, farmlands and urban areas. While they aren't endangered, the spotted owlet's population is thought to have declined in the last four years, perhaps owing to loss of habitat and increased urbanisation.",

In 2009, the British Cave Research Association led an expedition to explore the site. It was then that they realised something incredible: it was the world's largest cave. How large, you ask? Hang Sơn Đoòng's main passage is 3.1 miles long, 150 metres wide and 200 metres high. That's tall enough to fit a 40-storey skyscraper! Inside, there is a 60-metre calcite barrier called the 'Great Wall of Vietnam' and stalagmites stretching as tall as 80 metres. It even has its own weather system; clouds form inside the cave due to temperature differences between the cave air and the outside air.\nMoreover, a subterranean river links Hang Sơn Đoòng to the nearby Hang Thung cave, suggesting yet undiscovered depths. Given its fragile ecosystem, strict regulations are in place to preserve Hang Sơn Đoòng's pristine condition. Tours of the cave are limited to 1,000 visitors per year.",

The origins of these rides can be traced back to 17th-century Russia, where wooden slides—'Russian Mountains'—provided seasonal entertainment. The first roller coaster as we know it, however, was built in the early 19th century in Paris, France. Called 'Les Montagnes Russes à Belleville,' it featured wheeled carts securely attached to tracks. Fast forward to the 1900s, which saw innovation skyrocket with coasters looping the loop for the first time.\nPictured here is a hybrid coaster that combines wood and steel—Hakugei, the White Whale of Japan in Nagashima Spa Land. Once known as White Cyclone, this beast underwent a transformation in 2019. The ride's wooden track was replaced with a steel track.

At less than 10 million years old, erosion has had little geological time to smooth the edges of the mountains, hence the Tetons' jagged peaks.

It's on the rim of an extinct volcano, offering views of the surrounding paddy fields and the towering Dongrek Mountains of Cambodia in the distance.\nWith its earthen terraces, the promenade is one of the most striking features in this park filled with intricate stone carvings. Ahead of the promenade is the Phlab Phla, believed to be a bathing area used by royalty before entering the temple that we see here today. Next to it is a passage that stretches on for over 150 metres, lined with sandstone pillars, which leads to the first of three naga (mythical serpent) bridges that symbolise the transition from the mortal realm to the divine. At the top, the beautifully preserved shrine showcases a wealth of religious motifs, including sculptures of Hindu stories. The annual festival of Phanom Rung, held in April, attracts many who gather to witness the sun's rays aligning with the 15 doorways of the temple and lighting up the inner sanctum.",

These caimans are the largest species in the alligator family, growing up to 6 metres and weighing more than 450 kilograms. What sets them apart is their dark green colour, which helps them blend into the murky depths. These carnivorous creatures thrive in freshwater environments such as slow-moving rivers, lakes and seasonally flooded savannahs. From these waters, they hunt for birds, fish, turtles and occasionally big mammals. Black caimans play an important role in making sure ecosystems stay balanced by keeping their prey's populations under control. Fewer caimans mean more piranhas, which attack cattle, and more capybaras, which cause crop damage.",

In 1428, a major earthquake struck the area, which was felt in Barcelona, more than 50 miles away. The last seismic activity was registered in 1901 and 1902, when there were two minor earthquakes.

		"description": "Every year on August 30, ocean enthusiasts come together to draw attention to whale sharks and advocate for them. These gentle giants have been around for more than 240 million years, but the first specimen was discovered off the coast of South Africa in the 1820s. As the world's largest fish, whale sharks can grow up to 12 metres, with one reaching a record 18.8 metres. Found in tropical oceans around the world, these filter feeders glide through the water, mouth wide open, straining plankton and small fish. Each pattern on their dotted, starry skin is as unique as a human fingerprint. Sadly, the International Union for Conservation of Nature lists whale sharks as endangered due to overfishing, habitat loss and climate change. Amid adversity, there's hope, like in Cenderawasih Bay in Indonesia, a whale shark oasis that's pictured here. Here, these titans dine on the generosity of fishermen who feed them baitfish for luck, reflecting a unique bond between man and marine life.",

Spanish explorer Alvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca might have been the first European to see the falls. In 1907, businessman Domingo Ayarragaray saw the potential of this area and built a hotel and roads. The falls became such a sensation that they were designated as national parks on both countries—Argentina's Iguazu National Park in 1934 and Brazil's Iguaçu National Park in 1939.

Despite being able to exist in an array of environments and water temperatures, dolphins are threatened by a variety of human activities, such as hunting, pollution and fishing. Hunting in particular led to the creation of World Dolphin Day in 2022 by Sea Shepherd Global, an international marine conservation group.\nThe pod of dolphins seen in today's image was photographed near Réunion, an island in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Madagascar. A wide variety of marine wildlife can be found year-round in Réunion's deeper waters, including many types of sharks, orcas, humpback whales, sea turtles and of course, dolphins. The island's warm, tropical climate is ideal for these creatures, and spinner, bottlenose and rough-toothed dolphins swim in the island's crystal-clear waters.",

This stunning 71,028-acre (28,744-hectare) coastal haven on the Point Reyes Peninsula in Marin County, pictured in today's images, is a gem of the Californian coastline in the United States, boasting breathtaking views and diverse wildlife. Filled with scenic trails that wind through lush forests and along rugged cliffs, Point Reyes has much to offer its visitors.\nFamously recognised as the most wind-swept spot on the Pacific Coast and the second most foggy area in North America, Point Reyes has a fascinating historical background. The Point Reyes Lighthouse was constructed in 1870 to address the frequent shipwrecks in its treacherous coastal waters. This iconic landmark served as a crucial navigation aid for more than 100 years before being replaced by an automated light in 1975. Today, the lighthouse remains a key element of Point Reyes' charm and continues to be a favourite attraction. Whether you're spotting elephant seals, hiking to the picturesque Point Reyes Lighthouse, or simply soaking in the serene beauty of the rolling waves, there's something for everyone.",

The Last Night typically kicks off with a selection of classical favourites performed by top orchestras and soloists. Expect the second half of the evening to get properly patriotic, with anthems like 'Land of Hope and Glory' and 'Rule, Britannia!,' inspiring a joyous sing-along.

Wallabies have around 30 different species, including brush wallabies, rock-wallabies, hare-wallabies, nail-tail wallabies and swamp wallabies. These agile and sprightly mammals are herbivores, nibbling on grasses, leaves and fruits. With a height of 30 to 104 centimetres, wallabies have strong hind legs that help them take impressive leaps and serve as a defence against predators. During mating season, male wallabies engage in boxing bouts to show dominance in an attempt to grab females' attention. Social creatures, wallabies form small groups called 'mobs,' which provide safety and mutual grooming. Their playgrounds are forests that echo with the thudding of their hops as they navigate their home range with ease.",

Initially an inside joke, Talk Like a Pirate Day gained popularity after the duo shared the idea with humourist Dave Barry in 2002, who promoted it in his syndicated column. Since then, it's become a day of fun and parodic celebration—people don pirate costumes, engage in pirate-themed activities, like the kid on the ship in today's image, and embrace mock pirate language.

He spent much of his final days on Ocracoke Island until his death in 1718. The island's residents speak the unique 'Hoi Toider' dialect, a blend of Elizabethan English, Irish and Scottish accents.

		"description": "Autumn is in the air—officially. The September equinox marks the transition from the lush summer to the mellow autumn in the Northern Hemisphere, while in the Southern Hemisphere, it signals the beginning of spring. The term 'equinox' is derived from Latin, meaning 'equal night.' During this moment, the Earth's axis is perpendicular to the sun, meaning it rises due east and sets due west, a rare moment of global balance. This balance occurs because the Earth's axis is neither tilted toward nor away from the sun.\nLet's explore Buttermere in England's Lake District that mirrors this equinox enchantment with its tranquil waters and storied shores in today's image. Here, a Norse leader, Jarl Buthar, once defied Norman conquests during the 12th century. Some people think Buttermere's name may come from Buthar, but the more likely explanation is the nearby dairy pastures; Buttermere literally means 'the lake by the dairy pastures.' The lake, approximately 1.2 miles long, is not only a National Trust treasure but also the perfect place to take a break from the hustle and let nature refresh your spirit.",

These clever critters are smart as well as cute: they use rocks to crack open shellfish, making them one of the few animals that use tools. There used to be as many as 300,000 in the wild, but they were heavily hunted for almost two centuries, as their dense fur was highly prized. By 1911, it is thought that only around 2,000 were left. Thankfully, an international hunting ban, conservation efforts and reintroduction programs have helped them rebound, and they are now found in about two-thirds of their historic habitat.

European whalers first visited Svalbard in 1611, and Norway and Russia still use the islands for coal production. Today, however, tourists also visit the islands.

She was a pioneering nurse who made significant contributions during the Crimean War, setting up the 'British Hotel' near the front lines to provide care to soldiers. So, as Black History Month rolls around each year, let's remember that the journey doesn't stop when the month ends.",

A tradition since 1994, it unites people from bustling cities to serene lochs in a celebration of verse on the first Thursday of every October. Founded by William Sieghart, this event aims to make poetry more visible and engaging. It's a day when Prince Charles might recite Seamus Heaney, and train announcement boards become stanzas of TS Eliot and Auden. Everyday spaces transform into stages for the spoken word—a railway station or supermarket might suddenly echo with an epic. This year the special day focuses on the theme of 'counting.' So today, our image of Loch Morlich in Cairngorms National Park, Scotland provides the perfect backdrop for finding poetic inspiration. Why not let poetry alight upon your day?",

As well as helping us to understand the universe we live in, space exploration has played an important role in helping scientists develop new medicines, create new power sources and even improve farming techniques. This year's theme is Space and Climate Change; events will be held in 83 countries to celebrate the vital role that space technology plays in understanding and monitoring how Earth's climate is changing.\nSpace exploration has also led to amazing photographs of our solar system, like the one featured here today. Europa is one of Jupiter's 95 known moons. Its surface is mainly made up of frozen water, which has broken up and refrozen, creating the patterns seen on its surface. In fact, although Europa is just a quarter of the size of Earth, it may contain two times the amount of water found in our planet's oceans. Space Week is the perfect time to take a moment to appreciate the wonders of our solar system and beyond!",

It was discovered in 1999 around Rapa Island in the South Pacific and is known for the 'fake eyes' or ocelli—vibrant blue and yellow rings—between its eyes and arms. Found in the Indo-Pacific region, including Indonesia, Australia and Okinawa in Japan, mototi octopuses are masters of disguise. They usually have a dull orange-cream-brown colour but when alarmed, they can quickly shift to striking maroon with white stripes along their body and arms. Also known as poison ocellate octopuses, these cephalopods are highly venomous.

Found across the western states, especially in Utah and Colorado, these trees are the most widespread native species in North America. Their autumn foliage is breathtaking, with their leaves turning a vibrant yellow that lights up the landscape, as seen in today's photo, which was taken near Marble, Colorado. Aspens are not only beautiful but also biologically fascinating. They grow in large colonies that originate from a single root system, making them some of the largest living organisms on Earth.\nEach tree in the colony is genetically identical. When an aspen tree is cut down or damaged, the root system remains alive, allowing new shoots to emerge and grow, which helps create a resilient network that can survive harsh conditions, including wildfires. This species quickly colonises areas that have been recently burned down and can regenerate even after frequent fires. Aspen trees are more than just a treat for the eyes; they are an example of nature's resilience.",

The hidden valleys of Sorano are home to the Vie Cave, an intricate network of pathways possibly used as a defence system against invaders and wild animals.

The tiny ruby-throated hummingbird, weighing less than a penny, and makes the trip all the way across the Gulf of Mexico—a seemingly impossible feat for its size. Migratory birds navigate the globe, instinctively knowing when and where to move to exploit seasonal abundance. The Arctic tern outshines them all with its intercontinental journey from pole to pole, covering more than 18,000 miles. Their migration routes are passages created based on environmental cues.\nLet's take a moment to admire the vibrant plumage of the wood duck, photographed in Quebec, Canada and featured here today. Wood ducks, like the one in today's image, nest in tree cavities close to water and sometime take advantage of man-made boxes. During the breeding season, from February to April, you'll find the females laying 7-15 eggs. After breeding in the eastern and western United States and southern Canada, these ducks migrate southward in autumn to avoid harsh winter conditions. By October and November, they move towards milder climates in the southeastern United States and occasionally into Mexico.",

The Royal Alcázar of Seville, in the southern region of Andalusia, stands on the site of a 10th century citadel, which was expanded over the following 200 years. When Christian forces captured the city in 1248, the Alcázar was almost totally rebuilt in the Mudejar style, which takes inspiration from the intricate patterns and decorative motifs found in Islamic architecture. Within the Alcázar, there are several courtyards lined with delicately carved columns. One of these is the Patio de las Doncellas, or Courtyard of the Maidens, pictured here today.\nIn the centre of this beautiful space is a pool, whose still waters provide reflections of not only the blue Andalucian sky above, but of the intricate latticework of the courtyard's arches. Look a little closer at these arches, and you'll see carved shells, Hands of Fatima—a symbol said to bring protection—plants and Arabic script. Behind the columns, the walls are decorated with colourful ceramic times decorated with geometric patterns. These tiles, known as 'azulejos,' are a hallmark of Andalusian decoration.

The great migration, considered one of the seven wonders of the natural world, is a safari spectacle where survival is the prize. One of the most dramatic moments of the migration is the crossing of the Mara River.\nThousands of wildebeests gather at the riverbank, aware that danger lurks beneath the surface—the crocodiles—not to mention the lions and leopards that patrol the banks. When the first wildebeest takes the plunge, it's a wild rush as the rest of the herd follows, creating a chaotic scene. Some make it across, while others become part of the food chain.

Sloths are mainly leaf eaters, although they also snack on fruits and tree sap to keep them going. To help them break down those tough, fibrous leaves, they have a special multi-chambered stomach. With their super slow metabolism, digestion takes its sweet time, and they don't need much food each day to get by.

		"description": "At the top of the Spanish Steps in Rome, take a left underneath the imposing Catholic church. Down an unassuming side street, there's a surprise waiting for you: a house of monsters. Welcome to the Palazzo Zuccari, a 16th-century palace where myths seem to come to life on its façade—grotesque faces swallow up its doors and windows. Federico Zuccari, who built the palace, was well-versed in monsters. His painting of the Last Judgement in Florence Cathedral and his illustrations of Dante's Inferno are replete with mythical beings.\nThe monster door originally led to the palazzo's garden because Zuccari enjoyed making his guests experience the contrast between the scary entrance and the beautiful serenity of the garden. These days, the door leads to the Bibliotheca Hertziana, a library specialising in Italian art history, from the Middle Ages to the modern day, which has occupied the site of the garden since 1912. If you're looking for more monstrous mouths in Rome, not far from the Palazzo Zuccari is the Bocca della Verità, an ancient Roman mask. According to legend, it will bite off any liar's hand that's placed in its mouth.",

		"description": "Madame Sherri Forest in Chesterfield in New Hampshire, United States, is a captivating destination steeped in history and natural beauty. It was once the site of an extravagant house built in the 1930s by Madame Antoinette Sherri, a flamboyant 1920s costume designer known for her lavish parties. Madame Sherri's dramatic arrivals in town, often in a chauffeur-driven Packard, draped in furs, became the talk of the locals. As her fortune declined, her 'castle' fell into disrepair and was vandalised. In 1959, she returned to find her property in ruins and never came back. A fire destroyed the house in 1963, leaving behind only the stone foundation, an iconic staircase and a large fireplace leading to a lone chimney.\nToday, the forest where her house once stood spans over 500 acres (200 hectares) and offers scenic hiking trails through woodlands, hemlock groves and around peaceful brooks, a picturesque setting for outdoor enthusiasts. Managed by the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests, this area was named in honour of Madame Sherri and it also includes trails that lead to the ruins of her former estate. So, while the house was originally separate from the forest, the two are now intricately entwined.",

		"description": "In the ghostly silence of Bodie in California, United States, it feels like time stands still. This once-booming gold rush town was established in 1860. Bodie was named after WS Bodey, a prospector who discovered gold but tragically died in a blizzard before seeing the town's rise. When large deposits of gold were found there, it grew to nearly 10,000 residents, with saloons, dance halls and breweries lining its streets. But as the gold ran dry, so did the town's fortunes. The mines closed, the population dwindled, and by 1915, the place was abandoned. Bodie's streets are now empty, its wooden buildings frozen in decay.\nToday, Bodie is one of America's best-preserved ghost towns. Wandering through the streets, you can peer into dusty homes and storefronts, and even find small artefacts like shards of china and square nails from the glory days. Legend has it that Bodie's ghosts fiercely guard the town, and those who take souvenirs risk being cursed with bad luck. If that doesn't scare you, taking items home is against the park's rules. So, if you find yourself here, be sure to leave with nothing but memories—lest the town's spirits follow you home.",

The towering presence of Mont Blanc, seen in this image, has left an indelible mark on literature, most notably on Mary Shelley's 'Frankenstein.' The last Friday of October is Frankenstein Friday, honouring Shelley's literary genius and the fascinating creature born from her imagination. 'Frankenstein' was conceived during a ghost story challenge. In 1816, an 18-year-old Shelley, along with fellow writers Percy Bysshe Shelley, John Polidori and Lord Byron, spent a stormy summer in Switzerland. There, she penned the tale of Victor Frankenstein and the Creature. A pivotal scene in the novel takes place on a glacier near Mont Blanc, where Victor is confronted by his monstrous creation. This setting, with its surreal beauty and treacherous terrain, perfectly captures a sense of awe and terror.\n'Frankenstein,' also known as 'Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus,' was first published anonymously in 1818. Shelley's use of the epistolary form—a novel told through letters—and her blend of Gothic and early science fiction made 'Frankenstein' a timeless classic.",

At 2 AM this morning, the clocks fell back one hour, meaning there was an extra hour of sleep. While the idea of summer time was mentioned in 1784 by American inventor Benjamin Franklin, the first serious proposal for changing the clocks in the United Kingdom came from British builder William Willett in 1907. He valued having more daylight and felt so strongly about this that he published a pamphlet called 'The Waste of Daylight. Over time, many countries adopted the practice to give people more daylight in the evenings during the summer months.\nThe clock in today's image is of the Balmoral Hotel in Edinburgh, Scotland. This famous clock hasn't been on time since 1902, by three minutes, to be exact. The move was made to lessen the likelihood that the people would miss their trains. However, it does align with Greenwich Mean Time once a year, on December 31.",

Originally from Ireland and Scotland, this craft was taken to America by immigrants who initially used turnips and potatoes to create lanterns, but later found pumpkins more plentiful and easier to carve. By hollowing out pumpkins and lighting them with candles, they transformed the gourds into flickering defences against evil spirits.\nToday's image shows a pumpkin field in Victoria in British Columbia, Canada. Across the United Kingdom, from the sprawling fields of Lincolnshire in England to West Glamorgan in Wales , farms are full of this orange fruit. They become canvases for masterpieces, with ghoulish and whimsical displays gracing porches to welcome trick-or-treaters. As people gather to scoop, carve and light their pumpkins, they take part in a shared ritual that transcends cultures. Beyond their porch-light duties, pumpkins fill pies and spice up lattes, adding an element to the season that many anticipate all year long. Once merely a fruit, the pumpkin now enjoys a revered place in Halloween celebrations.",

With its keen vision, eerie vocalisations and silent flight, this owl has historically been revered and feared. In folklore and mythology, owls were considered symbols of wisdom and omens of death. On Samhain, the Celtic precursor to Halloween, the owl was believed to be the kin of roaming spirits.\nThe owl in today's image is far more than a character in ghostly tales. Often called the 'tiger of the air,' the great horned owl, named for its signature feathers that look like horns, is one of the most fearsome and adaptable predators in the ornithological world. Primarily active at night, the owl has large, powerful talons that exert around 2,100 kilopascals of pressure, which it uses to grab prey like small rodents and skunks. It has incredible night vision, but its eyes are fixed, so it must turn its head a whopping 270 degrees to see everything. So, whether you hear it hooting from treetops or see it flying in the night, this owl proves that not all scary apparitions are supernatural.",

Positioned high on an extinct volcano, these fortress walls have seen wars, royal births, executions and plenty of other drama since the 11th century. But what really sets it apart is its reputation as one of Scotland's most haunted spots. It's no surprise that with more than 1,000 years of history, some have reported ghost sightings.\nLegend has it that the Grey Lady, Janet Douglas, roams the castle's corridors. Also known as Lady Glamis, a noblewoman accused of witchcraft by King James V, she is believed to still lament her fiery execution in 1537. Others say the Grey Lady might be the ghost of Marie de Guise—mother of Mary, Queen of Scots—mourning her lost power amid the turmoil of religious reform. Then there's the Dung Man, a prisoner who attempted to escape in a wheelbarrow full of excrement. He died from the fall when the cart was emptied from the castle wall. The lost piper, who vanished into underground tunnels, continues to play a haunting melody beneath the city. And in 2001, the shadowy figure of a man in a leather apron emerged during a paranormal research project, leaving volunteers with a chilling memory. Spooked yet?",

		"description": "Red as far as the eye can see and clear blue skies overhead. Welcome to Arches National Park, Utah in the United States. The story of this otherworldly landscape starts 65 million years ago when a dry seabed stood here. Over time, geological forces warped and squeezed the land, twisting the sandstone into lumps and bumps. Later, wind and water carved out the arches, pinnacles, fins and balanced rocks that now stand in this area. The park has more than 2,000 natural stone arches, the highest concentration of these structures anywhere on Earth. In today's image, we can see two of them: Double Arch, photographed through Cove Arch. The larger arch of Double Arch spans nearly 44 metres and is over 30 metres tall, the tallest and second-longest of the park's arches.",

Blind at birth, these little ones are vulnerable in the first few weeks of their lives and depend entirely on their mothers. At around eight weeks old, they meet the rest of the pride.

Built between the 12th and 13th centuries on the Île de la Cité—an island in the Seine—Notre-Dame has witnessed centuries of French history, from the Hundred Years' War to the French Revolution, and beyond. Although it was chosen by Napoleon as the site of his coronation as emperor in 1804, by the early 19th century, the cathedral was in a state of disrepair. However, one novel changed its fortunes: 'The Hunchback of Notre-Dame' by Victor Hugo. The popularity of this book helped encourage a restoration project that renewed the cathedral's former beauty.",

These adaptable creatures can thrive in extreme environments, from the dry Atacama Desert to the chilly, windswept plains of Patagonia. In fact, their name even comes from the Quechua word 'huanaco,' meaning a wild animal or an animal that runs fast. And run they do, at up to 35 miles per hour!",

The Romans established January 1 as the beginning of the year in 153 BCE, but this fell out of favour throughout Europe during the medieval era. Since 1582 and the widespread adoption of the Gregorian calendar, however, much of the world now celebrates the new year today. In addition to watching fireworks, drinking champagne and making resolutions in the wee hours of the morning, other global traditions include making noise, eating lucky foods and giving gifts.\nIf you're wondering what polar bears like the ones in today's image have to do with the new year, the answer is simple: polar bear plunges. Countries around the world hold winter events where participants enter frigid, often icy bodies of water, and communities in the US, Canada, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom do this on New Year's Day.

		"description": "Perched on a terrace above the Inn Valley at 1,460 metres, Ardez is a hidden gem in eastern Switzerland renowned for its deep cultural roots and stunning preservation of history. This picturesque village, starring in today's image, showcases the rich traditions and unique language of Switzerland's Romansh-speaking communities. Its homes are adorned with sgraffiti—decorative designs etched into plaster—and colourful murals, both iconic art styles of the Engadin region. Dating back to 840 when it was first referred to as Ardezis, the village's history includes Steinsberg Castle, originally owned by the Bishop of Chur. Though destroyed during the Swabian War in 1499, the castle's tower has been restored multiple times and stands today as a proud reminder of its past. In 1975, Ardez was chosen as a Swiss model village for its exceptional preservation efforts, which have kept its historic charm intact.\nThe nearby Chastè site is a treasure trove of history, recognised as a Swiss heritage site of national significance. This fascinating location encompasses layers of human settlement, from the late Bronze Age through the early Iron Age and even includes artefacts from the Roman Empire. Against this backdrop, the star trails in today's photo illuminate the timeless allure of Ardez, where history and natural beauty converge.",

		"description": "'Don't adventures ever have an end? I suppose not. Someone else always has to carry on the story.' Today, on Tolkien Day, fans around the world honour the master storyteller who crafted the epic adventures of Middle-earth: JRR Tolkien. While Tolkien may have started the tale, it's his readers who carry it forward, generation after generation, diving into the pages of 'The Hobbit,' 'The Lord of the Rings,' and beyond. Tolkienists are encouraged to celebrate the author's birthday with a toast at 9 PM local time—to participate, all you must do is stand and raise a glass of your choice, say 'The Professor,' and take a sip.\nFor today's featured image, it is only fitting to visit a place that might have inspired the literary legend: the Radcliffe Camera, or Rad Cam, at the University of Oxford in England. Originally a science library, the domed, circular building now serves as a reading room for the Bodleian Library. This 18th-century building is said to be an inspiration for Sauron's temple to Morgoth on Númenor in Tolkien's fiction. Though Tolkien himself didn't study there—he was a student at Exeter College—he would have passed by the Rad Cam countless times during his years as a professor of English Language and Literature at Oxford. This building, with its extraordinary exterior, continues to captivate visitors and Tolkien enthusiasts alike.",

Over 25 metres tall and nearly 300 metres wide, it holds the distinction of being the widest waterfall in Vietnam. Located just 169 miles north of Hanoi, this waterfall has gradually worn away its crest over the years, inching upstream. For most of the year, they flow as two distinct cascades, but come summer, when the rains swell the river, they merge into one big fall.\nEven with better roads, easier public transport and drone videos showing off the jaw-dropping beauty of the falls, Bản Giốc remains refreshingly off the beaten path.

This Romanesque church, originally built in 450 CE, features a sturdy square bell tower added in the 9th century, enhancing the basilica's exterior. Its design features three naves, divided by two rows of 12 columns each. Featured in today's image is the basilica's real showstopper: the basement crypt, or a burial chamber, is a stunning model of early religious design. Complete with vaulted ceilings that slope down into rows of stone columns, its floor is a work of art itself. It's inlaid with beautifully intricate mosaic tiles that have withstood the test of time.\nBuilt on soft marshland, Ravenna faces ongoing structural challenges because the entire city is gradually sinking. This is particularly evident in the crypt, which now remains perpetually submerged under about a foot of water. But instead of battling the slow flood, Ravenna has embraced it, filling the pool with goldfish that glide between the ancient columns and above the submerged mosaics. Visitors here often toss coins into the water, likely wishing for good luck, making this crypt more of a wishing well than a burial site.",

		"description": "Are you ready to rock the new year? Today is Old Rock Day, a day for celebrating and learning about old rocks and fossils. Although rocks are common, few of us take the time to consider how amazing they are. Forged in volcanoes or moulded by millennia of pressure, these solid masses of minerals hold the key to understanding how our planet formed. Rocks can also contain fossils, the remnants of long-extinct organisms, which give scientists clues about what creatures and plants have lived on Earth during its 4.5-billion-year history. The United Kingdom, with its rich geological diversity, provides a front-row seat to the ancient forces that shaped our planet. On the Jurassic Coast in Dorset and East Devon, rocks over 180 million years old tell tales of dinosaurs, ancient seas and volcanic activity. And don't forget the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland, with its impressive columns of basalt.\nOne of the world's most curious rock displays can be found on Koekohe Beach in New Zealand. The Moeraki Boulders, some of which are more than 2 metres in diameter, have been shaped by nature over millions of years. Each boulder started as a pebble on the seabed around 65 million years ago. Over time, layers of mud and silt built up around them, cemented together by calcite. Thanks to erosion and the movement of the sea, the boulders eventually emerged. Today, new boulders are still appearing, while the elements are slowly breaking down existing ones.",

A salt and clay pan surrounded by towering dunes, Sossusvlei tells a story of contrasts. Every 10 years or so, an extraordinary event occurs when the Tsauchab River floods the pan, transforming it into a stunning turquoise lake. Nearby is the eerie Dead Vlei, with its ancient, desiccated camelthorn trees, which remain frozen in time as the extremely dry climate keeps them from decaying.

Created in 1972, Abraham Lake is a man-made reservoir that spans more than 20 square miles along the North Saskatchewan River. Thanks to glacier-fed waters from the Rocky Mountains, the lake stays transparent even in the coldest months. The glacial meltwater carries fine sediment that scatters sunlight, while natural filtration through rocks keeps pollutants to a minimum.\nThe snowy season attracts photographers and visitors from around the world who are eager to capture a rare sight at Preacher's Point: the bubbles. These frozen globes form when microorganisms break down dead plants and animals on the lake bed, releasing methane. As the gas rises, it gets trapped by the ice, creating layers of bubbles in various sizes and shapes. It's wild to think that they're flammable and chilling under your feet. The ice is thickest in January and February, making the bubbles clearly visible. If you're planning to check it out, just remember to stick close to the shoreline for your safety.",

Meknes reflects the Moroccan style of architecture, with one of its most impressive landmarks being Heri es-Swani, seen in today's image.\nHeri es-Swani was originally constructed as a stable and for storing vast amounts of grain to sustain the settlement and the Sultan's armies. Its design was both practical and impressive—thick walls and an innovative cooling system helped maintain the food supply. Twenty-two rows of symmetrical arches divided the space into corridors that used to have vaulted ceilings. Back then, mules climbed onto the roof terrace to deliver grain, which was then dropped through specially designed holes in the ceiling below. The structure housed more than 12,000 horses. Today, it stands as an empty shell, acting as a scenic backdrop ready to be explored. This historical monument is a must-see for anyone curious about how empires were built and fed.",

As part of this tradition, Calennig, meaning 'New Year's gift' in Welsh, plays a central role, linking the celebration to customs from the Julian calendar era. Even after most of the world switched to the Gregorian calendar in 1582, some Welsh communities clung to their old ways. Traditionally, the day involves children going door-to-door, singing songs and offering good wishes in exchange for gifts like coins, food or sweets. A unique feature is its clove-decorated apples. These aren't for snacking, though; they're miniature symbols of luck and prosperity.\nWhile these old traditions have evolved in some parts of Wales, the spirit of Calennig thrives. Cities like Cardiff, the capital of Wales, have transformed the celebration into large-scale events, complete with fireworks, markets and community gatherings. If your New Year's resolutions are already wobbling by January 13, Calennig offers a do-over. So why not embrace a little Welsh magic?

The story begins with Sir Hans Sloane, an Anglo-Irish physician and avid collector. His collection of more than 71,000 items, ranging from books and manuscripts to botanical samples and antiquities, formed the museum's foundation. Fast forward 266 years, the museum houses more than 8 million objects, the largest collection of artefacts in the world, although only about 1% of the collection is currently on display. Its treasures span continents and millennia, from the Rosetta Stone—key to deciphering ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs—to the Parthenon Marbles, the Benin Bronzes and samurai armour.\nMoreover, the museum has embraced modernity with virtual tours, interactive exhibits and even TikTok moments, proving that history isn't stuck in the past.

It all began in 1908 when President Theodore Roosevelt designated the area as a national monument. Later in 2013, Pinnacles earned its status as a national park. As we celebrate the anniversary of its establishment today, let's take a moment to appreciate this landscape. This land owes its formations to an ancient volcanic eruption that occurred 23 million years ago. The fiery beginnings made towering spires, cliffs and talus caves, created by falling boulders wedged into narrow canyons. Over millennia, tectonic forces shifted the landmass northward, leaving the park far from its volcanic birthplace. Talk about a journey!\nThis place offers a variety of trails, from easy walks to challenging climbs. The High Peaks Trail, featured in today's image, tests your stamina with steep climbs and narrow passages, while Bear Gulch Reservoir provides a more relaxed stroll. Moreover, Pinnacles is home to a range of wildlife including bobcats, jackrabbits and black-tailed deer and bird species like woodpeckers and bats, making it attractive for wildlife enthusiasts.

Although it's the smallest of the eight pelican species worldwide, it's still a large bird, measuring more than a metre in length and having a wingspan of nearly two metres. It's a marine-dwelling species and can be spotted along the Atlantic coast of the Americas, from New Jersey to the mouth of the Amazon River. On the Pacific coast, it can be spotted from British Columbia all the way to Peru, including a stop at the Galapagos Islands.\nThe brown pelican is a piscivore, meaning its diet mainly consists of fish. American poet Dixon Lanier Merritt's limerick famously begins, 'A wonderful bird is the pelican; his bill can hold more than his belly can,' and it's spot on—its pouch can store up to three times the volume of its stomach. This versatile feature acts as a scoop, a tool for cooling off during hot weather and a feeding trough for young pelicans. The brown pelican faced near extinction twice, first due to hunting and later from the impact of pesticides like DDT.",

The entire cave complex stretches on for around 2.5 miles, although visitors can only access about 300 metres of the total. Inside, there's a labyrinth of lit pathways winding past stalactite and stalagmite formations, leading to a 119-metre-long saltwater lake.\nNeptune's Grotto is near the town of Alghero on the northwest coast of Sardinia, the second largest island in the Mediterranean. It has been inhabited for at least 10,000 years, but its most important ancient civilisation, the Nuragic peoples, lived there from around 1800 BCE until the 2nd century CE. At this time, villages were built around nuraghes, a kind of round tower fortress. Today, there are still around 7,000 of these nuraghes across the island, and they have become a symbol of Sardinia.

This park isn't only a natural wonder but a historical treasure, with fossilised human footprints dating back as far as 23,000 years, some of the oldest in North America.\nToday marks the anniversary of White Sands being established as a protected site in 1933 by then-US President Herbert Hoover. What better way to celebrate than by immersing yourself in its beauty? Enjoy activities like hiking, sledding down the dunes or taking a scenic drive. Whether for its rich history or jaw-dropping sunsets, White Sands National Park is a wish-list destination that will leave you in awe.",

		"description": "What's that long, bushy tail scurrying across the branches? Chances are, it's a squirrel. These little rodents are found across most of the globe, and today is their special day: Squirrel Appreciation Day. This unofficial holiday was started by a North Carolina wildlife rehabilitator to encourage people to leave out seeds and nuts for these critters. From the tiny least pygmy squirrel—just 14 centimetres long—to the Bhutan giant flying squirrel at more than a metre, these mammals come in all shapes and sizes.\nToday's image features a Eurasian red squirrel, photographed in the Netherlands. The red squirrel can be found across Europe and Russia, from western Spain and Portugal all the way to eastern Siberia. Their diet mainly consists of nuts, fungi, seeds and berries, but they will occasionally eat birds' eggs. In addition to being the national mammal of Denmark, they also play a part in old Norse mythology. Ratatoskr is a red squirrel who scurries up and down Yggdrasil, the sacred tree, carrying messages and spreading gossip. So, next time you spot a red squirrel, it could just be a furry little messenger!",

Tucked in the heart of Jordan's arid desert landscapes, this ancient city once thrived as the capital of the Nabataean Kingdom in the 2nd century BCE. It was also a hub of the spice trade, connecting distant regions like China, Egypt, Greece and India. The city was abandoned for around 500 years before being rediscovered in 1812, earning it the 'Lost City' moniker.\nAd-Deir, seen in today's image, dates to the 1st century CE. Its design is characterised by a combination of Hellenistic and Mesopotamian influences. Although the exact purpose of the structure is debated, it's believed to have been used as a church during the Byzantine period. Standing nearly 45 metres tall and 50 metres wide, its massive facade is carved directly into the sandstone cliffs, showcasing the Nabataeans' ingenious craftsmanship and architecture. The journey to this landmark involves a steep hike up 800 stone steps, winding through rocky terrain. At the top, you're rewarded with panoramic views of the rugged Petra valley that make the climb more than worth it.",

Thorrablot, Iceland's midwinter festival, invites you to dive headfirst into tradition. This celebration of survival, culture, and community, which dates to the Viking Age, was once a way for Icelanders to honour Thor, the Norse god of thunder. Today, people celebrate by gathering to feast on an array of local delicacies, including fermented shark, smoked lamb, rye bread and shots of Brennivín—often called 'black death' schnapps.\nStrokkur geyser—featured in the image—warms up winter in a completely different way. Located in the geothermal area beside the Hvítá River, this geyser erupts every 6 to 10 minutes, shooting hot water 14 to 20 metres into the air, sometimes erupting up to 40 metres. It has been consistently active since 1963. There is science behind its eruption—magma beneath the Earth's crust heats groundwater until the pressure builds up, forcing the water explosively to the surface. Both Thorrablot and Strokkur celebrate Iceland's resilience—one through its people and the other through its land.",

Born on this day in 1759, his work blends sharp insight, emotion and cultural pride. Although much of his writing was in Scots, he also used English, ensuring his voice reached far beyond the country. Burns Night isn't just a party—it's a celebration of Scotland's cultural heritage, recognised by the Scottish Parliament, and highlights the richness of the Scots language.\nBurns' connection to Dumfries, a market town, is an important part of his legacy. He moved to Dumfriesshire in 1788 and settled in Dumfries in 1791, where he lived until his death in 1796. The town is home to the historic Devorgilla Bridge, pictured here, also known as Dumfries Old Bridge. Once a road bridge, it now serves pedestrians and stands as a reminder of the time Burns spent there. The bridge we see today contains remnants dating back to the early 1430s, with its stone structure likely completed by 1432.",

It's home to some stunning geographic features, like Zoroaster Temple, featured in today's image. This towering over 2,100-metre summit is in Coconino County, Arizona, United States.

Found on all continents except Antarctica and Australia, it's one of the most widely distributed bird species. This raptor belongs to the genus Asio, whose members are characterised by feather tufts ('ears') on their head. The short-eared owl only reveals its tufts when feeling defensive.\nBecause of the irregular wingbeats, its flight is on the floppy side, much like a moth or bat. It likes to glide a few metres above the ground in open fields and grasslands, swooping down feet first to grab its prey. Owls primarily hunt at night, but this silent hunter is also active during the day and at dusk. Its daylight hunts often line up with the peak activity of small rodents called voles—its favourite meal. Known to relocate to areas with higher rodent populations, the short-eared owl even wanders nomadically in search of better food supplies during years when vole populations are low.",

The 'Burgrave Gebhard vom Stein' is first mentioned in a document of King Wenceslas I of Bohemia in 1233, presumably referring to Königstein. At that time the area belonged to the Kingdom of Bohemia. In the 16th century, the castle underwent significant expansion to become a Saxon state fortress, with the start of construction of the imposing 152.5-metre-deep castle well between 1566 and 1569 being an important milestone. It is still one of the deepest historic wells in Germany.\nDuring the Dresden May Uprising in 1849, Königstein once again offered refuge to the Saxon royal family, and after the uprising was crushed, the arrested revolutionaries were brought to the fortress's state prison. During the First and Second World Wars, the fortress also served as a large prisoner of war camp. Until 1955 it was used as a youth work centre for the rehabilitation of young offenders, before being opened as a museum and attracting many visitors. In the winter months, Königstein Fortress is transformed into a fairytale winter wonderland, with frost turning the old walls into glistening works of art. No wonder this natural gem inspired Caspar David Friedrich to paint his 'Wanderer above the Sea of Fog.'",

When it comes to food, these creatures are herbivores with simple taste. They spend their summer days grazing on grasses, herbs, roots, seeds and flowers, storing up energy for their big event: a roughly nine-month hibernation party. Sometimes they eat grain, worms, insects and spiders. Beyond their hibernation habits, alpine marmots live a highly social lifestyle.

		"description": "If you're chasing sunsets and jaw-dropping views, come to Alstrom Point. Located in southern Utah's Kane County, this spot in the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area stands at an impressive height of over 1,400 metres. Made mostly of Entrada Sandstone, it has the same geological roots as nearby sites like Romana Mesa, its parent peak, and Gunsight Butte, another sandstone summit to the east.\nPart of the Lake Powell region, Alstrom Point extends southward into the vast waters of the lake, in between Padre Bay and Warm Creek Bay. When the lake is full, Alstrom Point towers nearly 300 metres above the water, offering views of the surrounding canyons. Lake Powell, spanning across Utah and Arizona, attracts around 3 million visitors every year. The lake is a maze of deep blue water winding through over 90 rock canyons. While its main stretch runs through Glen Canyon, it also snakes into over many smaller side canyons, along with the Escalante and San Juan rivers.",

Over 4,000 years ago, in ancient Egypt, Assyria and China, these foldable canopies were first used to shield people from the sun. It wasn't until the 17th century that the umbrella, as we know it today, gained popularity in Europe, initially as a luxury item primarily for women. Fast-forward a few centuries, and these weather shields have become a staple in pop culture, too. Remember Mary Poppins with her iconic umbrella that helped her fly, or Rihanna's hit song 'Umbrella'?\nBeyond their functionality, they've also made their mark in art and fashion. They often feature in artistic installations, such as the vibrant display at Borough Market in London, seen in today's image. But have you ever wondered why so many of them are left behind on trains? They're among the most commonly lost items worldwide!",

This masterpiece of early Buddhist art is near Datong in Shanxi province, northeastern China. Carved into sandstone cliffs over 1,500 years ago during the Northern Wei dynasty (386–534/535 CE), the grottoes contain 254 caves. The highlight is the massive Buddha in Cave 5, which is over 15 metres tall. But don't stop there—each cave offers something unique. Some are like ancient storyboards, depicting tales from Buddhist scriptures, while others showcase detailed carvings of monks, deities, musicians and even scenes of daily life under Wei rule.\nCaves 16–20, known as the 'Tanyao Five Caves,' were the first to be carved at Yungang, overseen by the monk Tanyao. While you're there, be sure to explore Cave 20's seated Buddha idol in a meditation posture, with a standing attendant Buddha on one side. What's fascinating is that these caves blend influences from Indian, Central Asian and local Chinese Buddhist art. Whether you're a history lover or simply appreciate unique art, the Yungang Grottoes offer an unforgettable experience.",

As an English naturalist, geologist and biologist, his theory of natural selection revolutionised our understanding of species, evolution and our role in the natural world. His work, 'On the Origin of Species,' published in 1859, laid the foundation for modern evolutionary biology. This day marks the birthday of Darwin and honours his genius while promoting curiosity, science and critical thinking. From thought-provoking talks to engaging exhibits, this day motivates us to keep exploring.\nSpeaking of cool science, marine iguanas, found only on the Galápagos Islands, serve as an example of Darwin's evolutionary principles. These reptiles, seen in today's image, are the only lizards in the world that forage in the sea, diving to graze on algae growing on submerged rocks. They've adapted in remarkable ways, from flattened tails for swimming to salt glands that allow them to expel seawater by sneezing. During his visit to the islands in 1835, Darwin noted their appearance as being like 'imps of darkness' but also recognised how perfectly they were adapted to their harsh environment.",

Over time, climate changes caused water levels to drop; these days, the lake is normally dry, except in winter when it's covered in around 5 centimetres of water. The name 'Tyrrell' comes from the local Wergaia word for 'sky,' a nod to the Boorong Aboriginal People's interest in astronomy. Spanning more than 70 square miles, Lake Tyrrell is a haven for wildlife, including Mallee reptiles, kangaroos and emus.\nIn recent years, the lake has become a tourist hotspot. People come from all over the world during the winter months, drawn by its mirror-like surface that reflects the endless Australian sky, making it the perfect photo op. The salt formations on the lakebed also provide a stunning backdrop for photographs. At night, it becomes the perfect place for stargazing, offering the chance to marvel at the constellations of the Southern Hemisphere.",

With over 100 species spread across the globe, kingfishers are found in a variety of habitats, from dense forests to coastal regions. Most species, like the common kingfisher, prefer freshwater environments across Europe, Asia and Africa, while others, such as the belted kingfisher, are found in North and South America. These birds are instantly recognisable by their vibrant plumage, often featuring a striking mix of blues, greens and oranges.\nTrue to their name, kingfishers are masters of the art of fishing. Perched patiently above water, they spot their prey with exceptional vision. Once a fish comes into view, they dive with precision, snatching their meal with a quick snap of their long, pointed beak. Unlike most birds, kingfishers don't build nests in trees. Instead, they dig burrows into riverbanks, creating tunnels that lead to cosy chambers where they lay their eggs. Kingfishers have been celebrated in myths and folklore for centuries. In many cultures, they are symbols of prosperity, peace and sharp intuition.",

A single square centimetre of their fur can hold more than 70,000 hairs, making it one of nature's most effective insulators. River otters were once endangered due to pollution and habitat loss. Yet, thanks to conservation efforts, their populations are rebounding in many regions across Europe.\nOtters are naturally playful, often sliding down snowy or muddy banks and diving underwater to find pebbles to play with. These solitary creatures communicate using a repertoire of whistles, squeaks and even scent, which also helps them mark their territorial boundaries.

Polar bears are native to the Arctic and can be found in Alaska, Russia, Greenland and Svalbard.\nThey're also found in Canada—like the cub in today's image, photographed in Churchill, Manitoba. Polar bears spend over half of their time hunting for seals on the sea ice, although they usually catch just one or two for every 10 that they try to catch. Their reliance on sea ice for hunting means that they are highly vulnerable to climate change. Sea ice is rapidly disappearing as the planet heats up, and polar bears are at risk of malnutrition and starvation as their hunting grounds vanish. Shrinking ice sheets also mean that these bears have to swim farther to find food, which depletes their energy reserves.

		"description": "A leek, a daffodil and a day to remember: Happy Saint David's Day! Today, Wales celebrates its patron saint and all things Welsh. Saint David was a 6th-century monk, bishop and preacher who played a key role in spreading Christianity across the country. He founded several religious communities known for their simple, disciplined lifestyles. One of his most famous sayings, 'Gwnewch y pethau bychain,' still resonates today as a reminder that small acts of kindness and faith matter. But why do people wear leeks and daffodils? Legend has it that the saint advised Welsh soldiers to wear leeks on their helmets to distinguish themselves from the enemy in battle against the Saxons. The daffodil, meanwhile, became popular later as a more visually appealing national emblem, especially during the 19th century.\nSo, what better place to visit today than St Davids Cathedral in St Davids, Britain's smallest city. Built on the site of Saint David's original monastic settlement, the cathedral has been a focal point of worship and pilgrimage for over a thousand years. With its sturdy Romanesque architecture and centuries-old traditions, it remains a testament to the saint's enduring legacy.",

Schools, conservation groups and wildlife parks host events such as nature walks, workshops, art contests, wildlife photography competitions and conservation talks to raise awareness. One species worth learning about is the southern yellow-billed hornbill, pictured here, a bird found throughout Southern Africa and commonly spotted in Kruger National Park in South Africa. Recognisable by its bright yellow, curved bill, this bird is often seen hopping on the ground in search of food. Its diet includes insects, seeds, fruits, berries, nuts and small reptiles, making it a key player in the ecosystem as both a predator and seed disperser.

Rooted in ancient Roman celebrations like Saturnalia, Mardi Gras evolved as Christianity spread, blending local customs—most notably Carnival festivities—with religious observances. The name itself originates from French, with the word gras meaning 'fat,' referring to rich, fatty foods like meat, eggs and cheese that are traditionally enjoyed before the fasting season begins.\nNew Orleans is synonymous with Mardi Gras, a tradition celebrated there since 1699. Today, colourful parades, masked revelers and iconic krewes define the city's celebration. Jackson Square, in the French Quarter, featured in today's image, stands as a witness to these lively traditions. Established in the early 1800s, it remains a central spot for visitors to experience the energy of Mardi Gras. The official colours of Mardi Gras—purple for justice, green for faith and gold for power—were set by Rex Krewe in 1872.

Native to North America, these sheep are known for their distinctive curled horns, which can weigh up to 13 kilograms. Rams use their massive horns in intense head-butting contests. During these battles, males hurl themselves at each other in charges of up to 20 miles per hour. Ewes, on the other hand, tend to keep things more low-key, forming smaller groups with their lambs. Adapted to the desert environment, bighorn sheep can go long periods without water, relying on moisture from plants to survive.\nValley of Fire State Park, seen in today's image, is one of the best spots in Nevada to observe these desert dwellers. This park is named for its fiery red sandstone formations that seem to glow under the sun. Beyond its natural beauty, the park holds deep historical significance, with petroglyphs left by ancient Indigenous peoples. It has also earned a place in pop culture as a filming location for scenes from 'Star Trek Generations.'

Inspired by church spires and ship masts, he envisioned a sleek, tapering structure that would reflect the changing sky. Construction began in 2009, and by 2012, it had officially claimed its title as Western Europe's tallest skyscraper.\nBuilt where Southwark Towers once stood, the Shard transformed the area into a hub of business, luxury and panoramic views. With 95 floors (though only 72 are habitable), the building houses offices, restaurants, the five-star Shangri-La Hotel and some of the priciest apartments in the city.

The Royal Arms of England, dating back to the 12th century, feature three golden lions on a red background—a design still used today by English sporting bodies. You'll also find lion statues guarding Trafalgar Square, standing tall outside historic buildings, and even on British coins.

This fortress has seen it all—battles, power shifts and royal connections. Originally built in the 14th century, the medieval castle was designed to guard the Loire River and control access to the region. Over time, it evolved into a residence for nobility, most notably serving as the home of Maximilien de Béthune, Duke of Sully, who was a trusted minister of King Henry IV. The castle played a significant role during the French Wars of Religion from 1562 to 1598 and has witnessed countless moments of intrigue and diplomacy. In 1940, during World War II, the castle wall was hit by shells, creating massive holes, but the framework remained intact.\nToday, after multiple restorations, the castle welcomes visitors eager to uncover its history. It also stands as an example of French Renaissance architecture. Visitors can explore the imposing towers, thick stone walls and the beautiful moat that once protected the castle from invaders. The restored interiors feature authentic furniture and artefacts, offering a window into medieval life. Guided tours provide insights into the castle's role in shaping regional and national history.

This date was chosen because 3, 1 and 4 are the first three significant figures of pi (π) when it is written out. Pi is an irrational number, which means that it can't be written as a fraction. When written out, its decimal representation goes on infinitely without repeating. The oldest attempts to calculate pi date back to ancient Babylon and Egypt, around 1,900 BCE.\nPi Day, however, has more recent origins. In the 1980s, physicist Larry Shaw organised the first celebration, where staff at a San Francisco science museum walked around in circles and then ate the number's delicious homophones: pies. Today's image takes us to Álava, northern Spain. The circular motion of the stars appears above the Dolmen of Sorginetxe, an ancient megalithic monument dating back to 3,000 BCE.

The term 'Ides' referred to the midpoint of the month in the Roman calendar, often marking the full moon. It was a time of celebration, with festivals and public gatherings. However, in 44 BCE, the Ides of March became synonymous with political upheaval, betrayal and an event that would trigger the fall of the Roman Republic. On that fateful day, Julius Caesar, Rome's powerful dictator, was assassinated by a group of senators. The conspirators, including his close ally Brutus, believed they were saving the Republic from Caesar's growing authority. Caesar was attacked near the Theatre of Pompey, but the tension of that moment echoed through the Roman Forum—the beating heart of Rome's political and social life.\nStrolling through the Forum, in present-day Italy, you can now see the remnants of history and the ruins of a once-mighty empire. Among its many treasures is the Temple of Saturn, pictured here.

It's also commonly spotted in marshes, rice fields, seasonally flooded grasslands and along riverbanks. At first glance, this feathered genius seems like any other wading bird, with its long legs, slender neck and pointed beak that aid in hunting. But when it hunts, this jet-black African species showcases an extraordinary skill—it takes the shape of an umbrella, as seen in today's image.\nWhile fishing, the heron dips its head, extends its wings around its body and forms a shaded canopy. This clever technique is known as canopy feeding. One common theory is that small fish, seeking cover, are attracted to the shade of the heron's wings and swim right into its trap.

		"description": "With the sun rising higher, the days grow longer, marking the arrival of spring. The spring equinox occurs when the sun crosses the celestial equator, moving from the Southern Hemisphere to the Northern Hemisphere. Traditionally, spring is considered to begin on March 21. However, astronomers and calendar makers now agree that spring officially commences on March 20 across all time zones in North America. This event signals the true start of the season, bringing with it the beauty and symbolism of spring blooms.\nAmong these blooms, narcissus, commonly known as daffodil or jonquil—featured here—stands out as a quintessential symbol of the season. Celebrated for centuries in art and literature, the daffodil carries cultural significance worldwide, symbolising death, renewal and good fortune. As one of England's most cherished plants, the daffodil has been celebrated by many English writers for its cultural and symbolic significance, making it one of the most poetically revered flowers. From John Gower and Shakespeare to William Wordsworth and John Milton, daffodils have inspired countless verses in literary history.",

These gentle giants of the sea have been gliding through warm waters for millions of years, minding their own business and munching on seagrass. But despite their laid-back nature, they face serious threats. Hence, the last Wednesday of March is dedicated to them—Manatee Appreciation Day.\nThere are three species of manatees: the West Indian, the Amazonian and the African manatee. The West Indian manatee, which includes the Florida manatee, can grow up to 4 metres long and weigh over 450 kilograms. These peaceful creatures spend most of their time grazing and napping. They have no natural predators, but human activity poses a major risk. Boat strikes are a leading cause of injury and death, as these marine mammals are too slow to dodge speeding vessels. Habitat loss and pollution also threaten their survival. Conservation efforts, including speed limits in manatee zones and habitat protection, have helped, but these sea cows still need all the support they can get.",

Located at the foot of the Acropolis in Athens, Greece, this stone Roman theatre has been setting the scene for performances for nearly two millennia.

With short legs, it perches upright and spends most of its time catching insects in midair. These birds attach themselves to mixed-species of social gatherers and are often active in the dense understory of the forest canopy.\nDuring the breeding season, the female lays two to three eggs in a cosy, cup-shaped nest tucked into a tree fork, as seen in today's image. The nest is woven with filaments of webbing and the Marasmius, a type of mushroom-producing fungus, known for its natural antibiotic properties. This clever design may help shield the young birds from harmful infections, turning the nest into a tiny, self-sustaining sanctuary. And here's a touch—they even decorate it with spider-egg cases.",

		"description": "For one Sunday in March, the United Kingdom, Ireland and some Commonwealth countries take a break from the usual hustle to honour mums with flowers, cards and the occasional burnt toast in bed. Mothering Sunday isn't just Britain's version of Mother's Day—it has a history that predates the modern celebration by centuries. In medieval England, it was a religious occasion when people returned to their 'mother church'—the main church or cathedral in their area. This pilgrimage often led to family reunions, giving servants a rare day off to visit home. Naturally, a visit to mum was part of the tradition, and over time, the religious aspect blended with a more personal celebration.\nBy the early 20th century, Mothering Sunday had faded from popularity, overshadowed by industrialisation and changing social norms. But thanks to a campaign in the 1910s and 1920s by Constance Adelaide Smith, it made a comeback. Inspired by the American Mother's Day, she pushed for a revival, linking it to existing British traditions. By the mid-20th century, the day had regained its status as an annual event dedicated to mothers. Today, Mothering Sunday is a blend of old and new traditions. While church services still acknowledge their religious roots, the day is largely about showing appreciation for mums, grandmothers and mother figures. Whether it's a Sunday roast or just spending time together like these desert elephants in Namibia, however you choose to celebrate, make sure mom knows she's cherished.",

The cave's most distinctive feature is its 'eye,' a natural opening in the ceiling that bathes the interior in sunlight, creating a stunning interplay of light and shadow. The cave is located near Benagil, a quaint Portuguese village on the Atlantic coast in the municipality of Lagoa. Until the late 20th century, Benagil was a traditional fishing village, with its economy deeply rooted in ocean fishing. Over the years, it has transformed into a thriving tourist destination, thanks in part to its stunning beach, Praia de Benagil. The region, including the Benagil Cave, showcases a perfect harmony of nature's wonders and the charm of Portugal's coastline.",

When the sun is positioned well below the horizon, during this brief window, the lingering sunlight casts a deep blue hue across the sky.\nNaxos is renowned for its deposits of emery, a corundum-rich rock that was once among the finest natural abrasives used before modern alternatives emerged. The most fertile island in the Cyclades, it has a reliable water supply in the region. It is celebrated across Greece for its signature flavours, including the rich Arseniko Naxou cheese, flavourful potatoes, aromatic Kitron liqueur made from local citrus and Naxian honey, primarily sourced from thyme nectar. A sun-soaked island, Naxos is packed with beaches, villages and ancient ruins. Whether you're looking to rest on the sands of beaches like Agia Anna, Agios Prokopios or Plaka, or chase the wind at one of the island's top windsurfing and kitesurfing spots, there's no shortage of adventure here.",

		"description": "From the famous tulip fields to the world's largest flower auction, the Netherlands and tulips go a long way back. Interestingly, tulips didn't originate here. These beauties arrived in the country in the late 16th century, brought from the Ottoman Empire. By the 17th century, they became so valuable that a single bulb could cost more than a house. This period, known as 'tulip mania,' is considered one of the first recorded financial bubbles. When prices crashed in 1637, fortunes were lost, but the love for tulips remained.\nThe most famous tulip fields, like the one pictured here, are found in regions such as the Bollenstreek (Bulb Region), just outside Amsterdam. Rows of red, yellow, pink and purple stretch as far as the eye can see. Then there's Keukenhof, in Lisse, the world's most famous flower park, open only for a few weeks each spring. It showcases over seven million bulbs, including rare and exotic tulip varieties. The designs change every year, so no two visits are ever the same. If you miss the bloom, don't worry—the Netherlands keeps its tulip industry thriving year-round. The Dutch take their tulips seriously, and nowhere is this more evident than at the Aalsmeer Flower Auction, the largest flower market in the world. Here, millions of flowers, including tulips, are bought and sold daily, making their way to homes across the globe.",

		"description": "Not so long ago, humanity took its first step beyond Earth. For thousands of years, we gazed at the stars, dreaming of what lay beyond. Then, on April 12, 1961, one man left the planet and changed history forever. That morning, Soviet pilot Yuri Gagarin climbed into a small, spherical spacecraft named Vostok 1. The countdown began. The engines ignited. As the rocket roared toward the sky, he called out, 'Poyekhali!'—'Let's go!' And just like that, Earth had its first space traveller.\nFor 108 minutes, Gagarin orbited the planet, watching the world from a view no human had ever seen before. When he landed safely back on Earth, everything had changed. Humanity had entered the Space Age. His flight sparked the race to the Moon, the dream of living on Mars and much more. Decades later, in honour of his achievement, the United Nations declared April 12 as the International Day of Human Space Flight. Pictured here is the view from the cupola of the International Space Station, showing the vast South Pacific Ocean. It is a reminder of how small Earth is in the grand cosmos—and how far human spaceflight has taken us.",

		"description": "New Year celebrations don't always come with fireworks—sometimes, they come with buckets and a nationwide water splash fest! Thailand's Songkran festival is a unique mix of spiritual traditions and all-out water fights. Held from April 13 to 15 this year, the holiday is deeply rooted in Buddhist customs and focuses on cleansing and starting afresh. During this time, people visit temples, offer food to monks and pour scented water over Buddha statues and elders' hands as a sign of respect. Meanwhile, the streets turn into water battlegrounds, with locals and tourists alike getting soaked in the spirit of renewal. Traditional parades roll through the lanes, and in some places, the 'Lady Songkran' or 'Miss Songkran' contest steals the show, with contestants dressed in stunning Thai outfits.\nThose seeking a calmer way to celebrate might consider visiting Wat Tang Sai Temple in Ban Krut, seen in today's image. Perched on Thong Chai Mountain, this temple complex is home to a 13-metre-tall Buddha statue and Thai-style pagodas. Built in 1996 to honour King Bhumibol Adulyadej (Rama IX) on his 50th year of reign (1946–2016), it remains an important spiritual site. With stunning coastline views, Wat Tang Sai offers a peaceful setting to meditate and feel the vibrations of Buddhist chants.",

You'll find them in the warm temperate and tropical waters of the Atlantic, hunting fish in coordinated groups. Their speed and agility make them efficient hunters—and a thrill to watch. The United Kingdom is home to several species, including the bottlenose, common and white-beaked dolphins.

		"description": "Within the remote canyons of southeastern Utah, United States, Natural Bridges National Monument highlights the power of erosion and the passage of time. Shaped by the relentless forces of wind and water, this monument features three magnificent natural bridges—Sipapu, Kachina and Owachomo. These bridges were named to honour the Ancestral Puebloans who once lived here. Sipapu is the largest bridge, with a massive opening that could almost fit the dome of the United States Capitol. Kachina, pictured here, is equidistant from Sipapu and Owachomo. It was named after the petroglyphs and pictographs found at its base. Owachomo is believed to be the oldest of the three. Its thin, arching structure suggests it may eventually collapse.\nRecognising the significance of these natural wonders, United States President Theodore Roosevelt designated Natural Bridges as Utah's first national monument in 1908. Today, it remains a place of awe and solitude, where visitors can hike beneath the soaring bridges, gaze at some of the darkest night skies in the country and step back into a landscape sculpted over millions of years.",

They look like they're wearing a bright orange-red costume, complete with a huge crest that almost covers their beak. With its bold colours, this native South American bird isn't just about looks—it's got the moves too.\nThe Andean and Guianan cock-of-the-rock are renowned for their theatrical courtship dances, making them true head-turners of the feathered kingdom. Females are far less flashy, with brownish feathers that help them stay hidden. During the mating season, males gather in leks—noisy display arenas—where they hop, squawk and shake their heads in an effort to impress a female. She watches, picks the best dancer, mates and then flies off to build a concave, cup-shaped mud nest on a rocky surface. The female typically lays two white eggs and incubates them for 25 to 28 days, raising the chicks on her own. The Andean cock-of-the-rock thrives in the cloud forests of the Andes, favouring dense, fruit-rich areas in Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia. As a frugivore, it primarily eats fruit and helps spread seeds throughout its habitat. It occasionally consumes insects and small vertebrates.",

That's why April 18 is the International Day for Monuments and Sites, an event recognised by UNESCO dedicated to protecting cultural treasures worldwide. This day is all about celebrating our history, raising awareness about endangered sites and making sure future generations can enjoy them too. A remarkable example is Göreme Historical National Park in Cappadocia, Türkiye. It's famous for its 'fairy chimneys'—towering rock formations shaped by volcanic ash and erosion over thousands of years. People even carved homes, churches and entire underground cities into these soft rock formations, some dating back to the 4th century. Today, it's a UNESCO World Heritage Site, attracting visitors from around the world.\nThe United Kingdom and its British Overseas Territories are home to 35 UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Among these, one site—the Frontiers of the Roman Empire—is shared between England and Scotland. It encompasses three significant defensive walls spread across Europe. These fortifications—Hadrian's Wall, the Antonine Wall and Limes Germanicus. At its peak in the 2nd century AD, the Roman Limes marked the empire's vast expanse, stretching over 5,000 kilometres. Hadrian's Wall in the UK, spanning 118 kilometres, was erected around AD 122 on the command of Emperor Hadrian to define the northernmost border of Roman Britannia. Further north, the Antonine Wall in Scotland, measuring 60 kilometres, was constructed in AD 142 under Emperor Antoninus Pius to fortify Roman defences against northern tribes.",
