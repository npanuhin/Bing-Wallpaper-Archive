		"description": "Put on your tartan and let the bagpipes play—it's St Andrew's Day! Scotland's national day is a public holiday there—though not everyone takes the day off. A fisherman by trade, St Andrew—also the patron saint of several other countries including Greece, Barbados, Romania and Ukraine—was one of Jesus' apostles and a key figure in Christianity. Though he never set foot in Scotland, his influence is immortalised in the country's Saltire flag, which is said to represent the cross on which he was martyred.\nFestivities on St Andrew's Day range from traditional folk music to high-spirited cèilidhs—social gatherings that involve music, dancing and storytelling. Food plays a central role in celebrations, too. Expect hearty servings of Scottish staples like haggis, neeps and tatties (mashed rutabaga and potatoes), smoked salmon and oatcakes. The day also serves as a warm-up to Scotland's winter festivals, leading into Christmas, Hogmanay and Burns Night. To mark this day, we're visiting Kilchurn Castle, one of Scotland's historic landmarks, in the west of the country. Perched on the banks of Loch Awe, the fortress was built in the mid-15th century by Sir Colin Campbell. Though this castle now stands in ruins, it still offers a glimpse into the country's medieval past and the powerful Clan Campbell.",

		"description": "When it comes to ringing in the New Year, Scotland takes the cake—or perhaps the haggis, its national dish. From torchlight processions to street ceilidhs, Hogmanay is the New Year's Eve celebration that says, 'Why settle for one night of celebration when you can have three?' The term 'Hogmanay' has murky origins—some link it to the French 'hoguinané,' which means 'gala day,' others to Norse or Gaelic roots. But what it means today is clear: an unmissable celebration filled with fireworks, folk songs and feasting. This year, the festivities kicked off on December 29 with a dramatic torchlight procession.\nOn December 31, as the clock nears midnight, cities like Edinburgh and Glasgow gear up for their iconic countdowns. Fireworks illuminate the skies as seen in today's image, but the real magic happens when the crowd bursts into 'Auld Lang Syne'. No Hogmanay is complete without 'first-footing,' a tradition where the first person to step into your home after midnight brings good luck for the year ahead. Bonus points if the first-footer carries coal, shortbread or whisky—symbols of warmth, sustenance and cheer. In true Scottish fashion, the party doesn't end when the clock strikes twelve. January 1 sees loony dooks—brave souls plunging into icy waters to shake off the cobwebs—or perhaps last night's whisky. And while January 2 is a public holiday in Scotland, it's probably less about recovering and more about preparing for another year of unforgettable celebrations. Cheers—or as the Scots say, Slàinte!",

The young leaves of these budding trees are significant to the Danish people, as they are harvested from April to May and used in cooking—particularly in salads. In the past, Europeans would often use the smooth bark of beech trees for writings texts. In fact, in the modern Dutch language, the term for 'book' directly translates as 'beech tree.' As the sun shines through the forest canopy, wild anemones brighten up the woodland with their white petals. These blooms, representing delicate beauty and sincerity, have even starred in masterpieces by artists such as Monet and Vincent van Gogh.",

With their iron-coated orange incisors, beavers fell trees, diligently constructing not just homes but habitats. Their dams create life-sustaining wetlands for countless species. Meanwhile, their lodges are masterpieces of security and comfort, the entrance strategically submerged to deter predators and provide privacy. The rodents have no trouble getting in, as they can hold their breath for up to 15 minutes. So, 'woodn't' it be nice to give a shout-out to these creatures on International Beaver Day?",

These sandstone balls—a phenomenon known as concretions—formed over millions of years as sedimentary layers built up around a central core of sand and stone held together by mineral cements. Erosion gradually wore away the outer layers to expose the spherical shapes we see today. This created a fascinating spectacle that only appears at low tide. Concretions are rare and there has been plenty of wild speculation about where they come from, with some believing them to be extraterrestrial debris while others wondering if they are dinosaur fossils.

Lying on a narrow strip of land between two lochs, the site initially comprised 60 stones, although today only 36 remain. The exact purpose of the structure is still unknown; in 2008, an excavation project called the Ring of Brodgar Excavation was undertaken to try to learn more about the site, but the project has not yet reached any conclusive results.

		"description": "Lace up those sneakers, channel your inner Mo Farah and get ready to join the ranks of marathon legends. This year, the London Marathon is back in its usual spring spot! This second-largest annual race in the United Kingdom will see runners from all walks (or runs) of life come together to tackle the ultimate challenge: 26.2 miles of pure grit and determination. Starting off at one of the three start lines (blue, green and red) between Greenwich and Blackheath, runners weave their way through the streets of the capital city, passing historic landmarks like Tower Bridge and Buckingham Palace. Moreover, the London Marathon isn't just about personal glory; it's also about giving back. With millions of pounds raised for charity each year, every step these runners take helps make the world a better place.",

		"description": "Today is Earth Day—a day dedicated to celebrating the planet we call home and raising awareness of environmental problems. The seeds of this day were planted back in 1969 when Gaylord Nelson, the then-senator of Wisconsin, USA, witnessed events like the Cuyahoga River catching fire and the Santa Barbara oil spill and decided that the world needed an environmental initiative. A year later, the first Earth Day event was held. Now, it has grown into an annual event with more than a billion people in over 193 countries taking part.\nThis year, the campaign's focus is on plastics, which are a particularly serious form of pollution on land and in the oceans. Many species—including this green sea turtle—eat the plastic waste they find in the ocean, mistaking it for food. These same plastics pose an entanglement risk and can also break down to become microplastics. Every year some 25 million tonnes of plastic enter aquatic ecosystems. So, whether you're planting trees, cleaning up beaches or simply spreading the word, let's remember to promote sustainable living. After all, there's no planet B!",

Despite their small size, Adélie penguins are sleek swimmers and can dive as deep as 175 metres in search of shrimp-like krill or fish. They are social animals which gather in small colonies for foraging, hunting and protection.

When observed from above, these round dwellings present an image of giant tyres or reels lying on their sides, with light walls, dark roofs and spacious interiors.\nHistorically, these buildings were communal living spaces and defensive zones for Hakka clans. The structures exemplified principles of equality and unity, with uniformly sized and shaped family areas, fostering a sense of community.

Winding through weathered layers of gneiss and dolomite rocks, the Fish River Canyon is around 100 miles long and about 549 metres deep. This popular site attracts adventure seekers with its hiking trail, which runs for over 50 miles, and the Fish River Canyon Ultra Marathon. Moreover, with Hartmann's mountain zebras, klipspringers and Eastern rock elephant shrews, the canyon is teeming with creatures big and small. So, whether you are there for hiking, trekking, camping or just soaking in the scenery, one thing's for sure: Fish River Canyon is a catch you won't soon forget.",

Vernazza got its name from the indigenous wine, 'vernaccia,' meaning 'local' or 'ours.' One of the best-known monuments in the area is Doria Castle, built in the 15th century as a defensive fortress to protect the village from frequent pirate attacks. Thanks to the construction of the Genoa–La Spezia rail line in the 19th century, the village became more accessible by land. The cobblestone streets and absence of cars make it ideal for walking around. While here, you might want to visit the Chapel of Santa Marta and the Sanctuary of Madonna di Reggio.

		"description": "It's not just a name. Chestnut-headed bee-eaters really do spend their days swooping after stinging insects. As well as bees, they also feast on wasps, hornets and other bugs. The birds in today's image are in Bardia National Park in Nepal, but they're found across many other South Asian countries, from India and Bangladesh to Sri Lanka and Thailand. They catch their prey in mid-flight, returning to a perch where they can beat stinging insects to stun them, which makes them safe to eat. These birds are designed to hunt: their dazzling green plumage helps camouflage them in dappled jungle light, their curved beak is perfect for picking off insects with precision and their eyes can move individually, which makes them all the better for spotting bees.",

		"description": "Eighty years ago, on the beaches of Normandy, northern France, an event unfolded that would alter the course of history. The day was June 6, 1944, a date forever etched in time as D-Day. It marked the launch of Operation Overlord, the ambitious Allied invasion of western Europe that became a turning point in World War II. The audacious assault by sea, air and land involved nearly 160,000 troops mainly from the USA, Britain and Canada.\nToday, on this 80th anniversary, we are featuring Les Braves, a sculpture that pays tribute to the courageous troops who landed here. One such symbol is Les Braves, a sculpture gracing Omaha Beach. French artist Anilore Banon's design features three sections called 'Wings of Hope', 'Rise, Freedom!' and 'Wings of Fraternity'. In addition, across the ocean in Michigan, its twin, 'Les Braves II: At Water's Edge,' resonates with the same spirit at The War Memorial. These sister sculptures stand as guardians of memory, inviting a moment of silence from a world that benefitted from the bravest of the brave.",

This day is about honouring and protecting the world's oceans and serves as a reminder of the critical role oceans play in supporting life on Earth. These gargantuan water bodies, after all, teem with wonders, from the tiniest plankton to the grandest whales like the humpbacks we see here. The oceans also produce almost half of the oxygen on our planet thanks to the photosynthesis of plankton—tiny plants, algae and bacteria. Moreover, they absorb a significant amount of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, helping mitigate the impacts of climate change caused by human activities.\nOceans face many threats, including rising sea temperatures thanks to global warming, plastic pollution and ocean acidification, which threatens many marine species. The theme for this year's World Oceans Day is 'Awaken New Depths.' This motto encourages us to delve deeper into the ocean's complexities and take urgent actions to ensure that these fascinating, ocean-dwelling animals continue to grace our planet for generations to come.

Britain's fastest land mammals become a captivating sight, chasing and 'boxing' in the fields. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, these hares' tawny coat is perfect camouflage for the temperate, open landscapes they favour. Their diet of grasses and herbs, and in winter, twigs and bark, fuels their remarkable bursts of speed, essential for outrunning predators. Unlike their burrow-dwelling rabbit cousins, hares bear their young, known as leverets, above ground. From birth, these youngsters are on the move—furry, wide-eyed and precociously active.\nWhile listed as 'least concern' by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, experts warn that hare populations have been waning since the 1960s, largely due to intensive farming practices. As wanderers of the wide-open lands and protagonists in countless myths and works of art, European hares continue to leap through our cultural fabric and across our fields, embodying the wild and unpredictable spirit of nature itself.",

Moreover, gemsboks are adept runners, achieving speeds of up to 37 miles per hour. Their distinguishing trait is their notably elongated, straight horns. Although both genders possess these formidable defences, the females' horns tend to be slightly longer and sleeker while the males' horns are thicker with broader bases.

The square embodied the essence of the Timurid Renaissance, a period of cultural and intellectual revival, which spread throughout the Muslim world between the 14th and early 16th century CE.\nIn this grand square, citizens came together to hear royal proclamations, announced with resounding blasts from colossal copper pipes known as dzharchis. The Registan Square is encircled by three Islamic schools, namely the Ulugh Beg Madrasah, the Sher-Dor Madrasah and the Tilya-Kori Madrasah, characterised by the Islamic architectural style, which typically features elaborate repetitive patterns and ornamental forms. The influence of Registan's magnificence is seen everywhere, from the Safavid monuments of Persia to the Mughal buildings of India and Pakistan.

		"description": "As summer blooms in London, a centuries-old ceremony unfurls with pomp and pageantry—Trooping the Colour. The event marks the official birthday of the British sovereign in a tradition dating back to the 18th century. Trooping the Colour is deeply rooted in the practicalities of yore, where battlefield standards served as vital rallying symbols for soldiers.\nToday, the regiments of the Household Division, resplendent in their bearskin hats and scarlet tunics, perform this ritual with a Drummer's Call and the dignified slow march, imbuing their colours with the respect and reverence they deserve. These striking flags are then paraded, or 'trooped', before the monarch, a salute to the sovereign's connection to the armed forces. And then, there's the fly-past by the Royal Air Force, where aircraft from yesteryear and today roar over the Buckingham Palace, while the Royal Family watches from the balcony. The ritual is not just a London spectacle; it resonates within Commonwealth realms, each adding local flair. In Canada, it blends with the solemnity of Remembrance Day.

There are also great dads in the animal kingdom, like the foxy father seen in today's image. Female red foxes need to stay in their dens with their young after giving birth, so males spend their time going out to bring her food. When the pups are a little older, their father takes time to play with them, teaching them survival skills they'll need in later life, like hunting and scavenging. The foxes seen here are melanistic, a condition in animals that results in darker colouring.\nFather's Day dates back to the early 20th century. After hearing about the first Mother's Day celebrations, Sonora Smart Dodd of the US, the daughter of a widowed Civil War veteran who raised her and her five siblings, decided that fathers needed a similar day of celebration. However, the idea spread, and by the 1970s, Father's Day became officially recognised in many countries, including the UK.

		"description": "You might have seen lakes with some unique colours before, but Indonesian island of Flores, with its volcano Kelimutu, may steal the show. Home to three lakes, each with its own hue and folklore, this natural wonder attracts travellers seeking an otherworldly experience. Volcanic vents deep within the Earth release steam and gas, which alter the lakes' mineral compositions, causing reactions that transform their appearance periodically.\nEach lake at Kelimutu has its own unique chemical makeup, which is why they can be different colours from each other at the same time, and these colours can change independently. The westernmost lake, Tiwu Ata Bupu (Lake of Old People), normally has a blue hue. Meanwhile, Tiwu Ko'o Fai Nuwa Muri (Lake of Young Men and Maidens) tends to be green and Tiwu Ata Polo (Bewitched or Enchanted Lake) is usually red. The local Lio people revere these lakes, believing them to be the resting place of souls. So, why settle for the usual beachside vacation when you can explore a trio of colour-changing lakes?",

The park's highlight, Fire Wave, is a geological marvel that appears like a frozen wave with its red, pink and white stripes.\nIn the park, you will come across mysterious petroglyphs, rock carvings made by scratching on the rock's surface, left by the Ancestral Puebloans, who were farmers from the nearby Moapa Valley. It is likely they practiced hunting and performed religious ceremonies in this area. If you are a history buff, you might want to try and decode the cryptic messages carved on the rock faces. Well, put on your hiking shoes and get ready to wander, to wonder and to witness the Valley of Fire State Park.",

Cardinalfish can grow up to 8 centimetres and have tiny shimmery bodies with black vertical stripes and white-edged fins, which help them disguise. Unlike some finned creatures that migrate long distances, these pint-sized fish inhabit a small world, rarely straying far from their local reefs.\nEach young cardinalfish begins life being guarded by their fathers, who carry the eggs in their mouths for up to 30 days to shield them from the aquatic perils. Within these jaws, young fish embark on a silent metamorphosis, soon to emerge, ready to explore the currents. In their early stages, they form dense schools for protection against predators and hide among the spines of sea urchins and anemones. The diet of these opportunistic feeders primarily consists of small fish, crustaceans and plankton. Their existence whispers tales of resilience—a creature to cherish and protect for the spectacle of life it presents.",

More than just a church, this Gothic structure, with its red-tiled dome, is steeped in centuries of history. Built over an older cathedral dedicated to Santa Reparata, construction began in 1296 under the supervision of architect Arnolfo di Cambio.\nFilippo Brunelleschi, an Italian architect and designer, engineered its dome, which is the largest brick dome ever constructed. It was built without the support of traditional wooden frameworks; its completion in 1436 was the final stage of the cathedral's construction. It's not just the outside that dazzles; inside there are artistic treasures to discover, from Giorgio Vasari's fresco 'The Last Judgement' to Paolo Uccello's intricate clock face. The cathedral complex is also home to the Baptistery, a small basilica and Giotto's Campanile, a free-standing bell tower.

At the time, homosexuality was illegal, and raids against LGBTQIA+ establishments were common. However, on that night, the patrons of the Stonewall Inn, fed up with the continued harassment, decided to stand their ground. Violence escalated, leading to clashes between protesters and police. In the following days, there was more rioting as people gathered to protest the raids.\nOn June 28 the following year, gay pride marches were held in New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago to mark the anniversary of the riots. Similar marches soon started to be held annually in hundreds of places across the US and the rest of the world. June 28 is now celebrated as International LGBTQIA+ Pride Day. In 2016, the Stonewall Inn, Christopher Park and several nearby streets were officially dedicated as the Stonewall National Monument. So, today is the perfect time to remember those who have fought for LGBTQIA+ rights before, during and after Stonewall.",

In 1992, London first held EuroPride and bewitched a crowd of 100,000 with the message of love and equality. Fast forward to 2024, and Pride in London stands as the largest pride festival in the UK, with an incredible 1.5 million visitors estimated to have attended in recent years.\nFrom the activism of several gay liberation groups to the powerful statement made by the Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners in 1985, every step taken in the parade echoes the footsteps of those who marched before.

But don't be fooled by their names; meerkats are not cats. They're small carnivores of the mongoose family, native to the deserts and grasslands of southwestern Africa. Meerkats are highly social animals, living in tight-knit groups called mobs, which can consist of up to 30 individuals. These groups are a cooperative effort, with meerkats foraging together, grooming each other, babysitting and taking turns as sentinels to watch for predators. These critters create extensive burrows where they spend the night and retreat to escape the midday heat–meerkats love their afternoon siesta.\nWorld Meerkat Day, founded at Taronga Western Plains Zoo in Australia on July 3, 2018, is celebrated all over the world. This day aims to raise awareness about meerkats and their ecological importance. Classed as 'least concern' on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species, these tiny mammals are vital for controlling insect populations in their desert habitats. So, let's unite to spread the word, ensuring future generations continue to be captivated by these remarkable creatures!",

The city was the first Roman settlement on the Iberian Peninsula and played a significant role in the Romanisation of the region, then known as Hispania—today Spain. Italica flourished in the centuries following its founding, especially during the rule of Emperors Trajan and Hadrian, who were born there.\nThe ruins of Italica are the remains of a once-bustling urban centre. Its most emblematic feature is the amphitheatre, seen in today's image. One of the largest in the Roman Empire, it could accommodate up to 25,000 spectators, more than double the city's population. Beyond this, there are remains of impressive public buildings, a temple built in honour of Trajan, baths and villas decorated with stunning mosaics.

These resilient species, capable of surviving for at least 9 years in the wild and surpassing 10 years in captivity, face numerous threats in their environment. Predation from various sources, including badgers, coyotes, snakes and both feral and domesticated pets like cats and dogs, poses a constant danger to its survival. The burrowing owl exhibits remarkable adaptive behaviours, such as nesting and roosting in abandoned ground burrows of armadillos, prairie dogs or skunks. When confronted with danger, the owl retreats to these burrows and emits rattling and hissing sounds.",

Japan is made up of 14,125 islands and has over 18,400 miles of coastline, so it's no wonder the sea plays such a key role in national life. As well as providing much of the country's food, the seas that surround Japan are vital for trading and communicating with other nations.\nTo celebrate this day, many people take a trip to the beach. Another Marine Day tradition is to give something back to the ocean by throwing mudballs into the water; these balls are packed with microorganisms that help to purify the sea. Today's image takes us to Tateishi Park in Yokosuka. This scenic spot has stunning views of Sagami Bay and Mount Fuji, making it the perfect place to celebrate Japan's coastal waters on Marine Day.",

Since its inception in 1990, it has evolved into a two-week event. A clever shift from September to July has made it easier for archaeological buffs to explore summer digs and heritage wonders. This year's theme of 'Archaeology and Community' invites enthusiasts across the United Kingdom for an array of in-person and virtual events organised by heritage organisations, local societies and passionate individuals.\nImagine standing amid Skara Brae's ancient stone houses on Scotland's Orkney archipelago, pictured here, where Neolithic settlers thrived over 5,000 years ago. Exposed by an 1850 storm, this prehistoric marvel is dubbed the 'Scottish Pompeii' due to its astonishing preservation—older than Stonehenge and even the Great Pyramids. So, grab your trowel and get ready to dig deep into the incredible, storied past. Who knows what you'll discover!",

With origins as a self-ruling city, in the Middle Ages, this walled Bavarian town once flourished with 6,000 inhabitants, making it the Holy Roman Empire's second-largest city at the time. The growth of Rothenburg ob der Tauber, slowed in the 17th century, preserving its original character. Pictured here is Burgtor or the castle gate, which was built after the original Rothenburg Castle was destroyed by an earthquake in 1356.\nWithin the castle gate is an 'eye-of-the-needle' door, designed to be the only way in and out of the castle when the main gates closed at night. But Rothenburg's magic isn't confined to its walls. It's also a gateway to the 290-mile Romantic Road that runs from Würzburg to Füssen, covering Bavaria's castle-studded valleys. Upon return, things can get festive at the Käthe Wohlfahrt Christmas Village, a dream for holiday enthusiasts. So, 'burg' up for a medieval adventure.",

Running from July 15 to 21, Coral Reef Awareness Week is the perfect time to honour them. Coral reefs are formed by tiny marine organisms called coral polyps, which create vast colonies that serve as homes to a diverse array of marine species. As we turn our attention to their beauty and benefits, it's vital to recognise the lurking threats–climate change, pollution and harmful human activities.\nPictured here is Mayotte, a paradise beneath the Indian Ocean's surface. This French island boasts one of the world's largest and deepest lagoons, encircled by a coral reef of nearly 100 miles long. Mayotte's lagoon is home to over 250 species of coral and over 3,500 marine species. But it is facing numerous threats, including overfishing and coral bleaching, where corals expel the algae that live in their tissues, leading to a loss of colour and essential energy sources. So, this week, let's pledge to preserve coral reefs like this one. Dive in, because every splash counts.",

Jaguars arrived in the Americas some 2 million years ago, migrating from Eurasia through the Bering Strait. Today, they inhabit diverse habitats, from the woodlands of southwestern United States to the rainforests of northern Argentina.\nOften found near bodies of water, jaguars are excellent swimmers, ambushing prey by leaping into the water. True carnivores, jaguars rely exclusively on meat for their nutritional needs. They feed on a wide range of animals, including deer, armadillos, monkeys and lizards. Their strong teeth and jaws can also bite through turtle shells and crocodile heads. In the Brazilian Pantanal, a small population of jaguars primarily feeds on aquatic reptiles and fish. So, the next time you are on a jungle trail, keep your eyes peeled and your senses sharp–remember: every rustle of leaves could be a jaguar on the prowl!",

Initially celebrated as National Moon Day in the United States, the day was recognised globally by the United Nations in 2021. Human civilisations have gazed at the sky for millennia, contemplating the origins and mysteries of the moon. The advent of space exploration transformed the moon into the target of numerous missions.\nApollo 11, the pioneering space mission that first landed humans on the moon, was launched on July 16, 1969. It culminated in the astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin taking the first steps on the moon on July 20, 1969. Moon Day commemorates this historic event and serves as a reminder of the significant efforts required to launch the space programme. Moon missions have found no signs of life, but it could be a future site for human colonisation. The discovery of water ice, especially in the dark craters at the poles, makes it more hospitable for potential settlers. So, until you have a chance to live there, keep dreaming under the same moon that has captivated humanity since time immemorial.",

Tianlong, standing at 235 metres, has a bridge-pier with maze-like caves in it. The Qinglong Bridge, which is 281 metres high, offers breathtaking views when the sun is out. Heilong Bridge is the widest of the three bridges at 193 metres and reaches a height of 223 metres. Visitors can explore the Wulong Karst National Geology Park and visit places like the Furong Cave, a 2,846-metre cave with huge limestone stalactites, which are mineral formations that hang from the ceiling. Standing beneath these magnificent natural bridges, you can't help but be humbled by the sheer power of time and nature.",

		"description": "These medieval towers stand tall over San Gimignano, a small town near Siena in north central Italy. In the Middle Ages, a town grew up around a church dedicated to Saint Geminianus—San Gimignano in Italian. As well as being a popular stop for pilgrims on their way to Rome, the town prospered thanks to its trade in local Vernaccia wine and in saffron, which is grown in the nearby hills. However, when the Black Death struck in 1348, half the population was lost, slowing the town's development and preserving its medieval character to this day.\nSan Gimignano's most recognisable feature is its skyline, made up of 14 towers. These impressive structures were the result of a rivalry between two families, each competing to build the tallest tower-house. By the end of the medieval period, there were 72 towers in the town, although because of wars, other catastrophes and building projects, many were lost. Today, the tallest tower still standing is the Torre Grossa—'big tower' in Italian. Built in 1310, it stands at an incredible 54 metres. It's no wonder that the town is sometimes called the Manhattan of the Middle Ages.",

The islet is all that remains of a volcano that erupted about 230,000 years ago. According to Hawaiian mythology, Pele the fire goddess was in love with a man named Mo'o. The trouble was that Mo'o was in love with another woman. Pele's revenge was typically violent: she cut her rival in two, her body becoming Molokini, while her head became Pu'u Olai, a cinder cone on Maui.\nMolokini Crater these days is a prime scuba and snorkelling destination; the islet's crescent shape protects divers from waves and currents, allowing them to enjoy the reef, where visibility can reach up to 46 metres. This habitat is home to at least 250 species of fish, including black triggerfish and parrotfish, as well as 38 species of hard coral and some 100 species of algae. So, come on in, the water's lovely. Just be sure not to anger Pele.",

With piercing yellow eyes against a grey-brown face, spotted owlets are often seen when small birds spot them during the day and mob them. Once located, these primarily nocturnal owls will often stare down intruders, bob their heads and emit a loud 'chirurrr-chirurrr-chirurrr' screech, or what's sometimes described as laughter or chuckling.\nStanding around 20 centimetres tall, speckle-plumed spotted owlets can be found from Iran to Vietnam. This one was photographed in Bangkok, Thailand. They primarily eat insects and small mammals like bats and mice, which they often store to eat later when food is scarce. Spotted owlets are a remarkably resilient species that flourish in environments such as semi-deserts, rocky areas, forests, farmlands and urban areas. While they aren't endangered, the spotted owlet's population is thought to have declined in the last four years, perhaps owing to loss of habitat and increased urbanisation.",

In 2009, the British Cave Research Association led an expedition to explore the site. It was then that they realised something incredible: it was the world's largest cave. How large, you ask? Hang Sơn Đoòng's main passage is 3.1 miles long, 150 metres wide and 200 metres high. That's tall enough to fit a 40-storey skyscraper! Inside, there is a 60-metre calcite barrier called the 'Great Wall of Vietnam' and stalagmites stretching as tall as 80 metres. It even has its own weather system; clouds form inside the cave due to temperature differences between the cave air and the outside air.\nMoreover, a subterranean river links Hang Sơn Đoòng to the nearby Hang Thung cave, suggesting yet undiscovered depths. Given its fragile ecosystem, strict regulations are in place to preserve Hang Sơn Đoòng's pristine condition. Tours of the cave are limited to 1,000 visitors per year.",

The origins of these rides can be traced back to 17th-century Russia, where wooden slides—'Russian Mountains'—provided seasonal entertainment. The first roller coaster as we know it, however, was built in the early 19th century in Paris, France. Called 'Les Montagnes Russes à Belleville,' it featured wheeled carts securely attached to tracks. Fast forward to the 1900s, which saw innovation skyrocket with coasters looping the loop for the first time.\nPictured here is a hybrid coaster that combines wood and steel—Hakugei, the White Whale of Japan in Nagashima Spa Land. Once known as White Cyclone, this beast underwent a transformation in 2019. The ride's wooden track was replaced with a steel track.

At less than 10 million years old, erosion has had little geological time to smooth the edges of the mountains, hence the Tetons' jagged peaks.

It's on the rim of an extinct volcano, offering views of the surrounding paddy fields and the towering Dongrek Mountains of Cambodia in the distance.\nWith its earthen terraces, the promenade is one of the most striking features in this park filled with intricate stone carvings. Ahead of the promenade is the Phlab Phla, believed to be a bathing area used by royalty before entering the temple that we see here today. Next to it is a passage that stretches on for over 150 metres, lined with sandstone pillars, which leads to the first of three naga (mythical serpent) bridges that symbolise the transition from the mortal realm to the divine. At the top, the beautifully preserved shrine showcases a wealth of religious motifs, including sculptures of Hindu stories. The annual festival of Phanom Rung, held in April, attracts many who gather to witness the sun's rays aligning with the 15 doorways of the temple and lighting up the inner sanctum.",

These caimans are the largest species in the alligator family, growing up to 6 metres and weighing more than 450 kilograms. What sets them apart is their dark green colour, which helps them blend into the murky depths. These carnivorous creatures thrive in freshwater environments such as slow-moving rivers, lakes and seasonally flooded savannahs. From these waters, they hunt for birds, fish, turtles and occasionally big mammals. Black caimans play an important role in making sure ecosystems stay balanced by keeping their prey's populations under control. Fewer caimans mean more piranhas, which attack cattle, and more capybaras, which cause crop damage.",

In 1428, a major earthquake struck the area, which was felt in Barcelona, more than 50 miles away. The last seismic activity was registered in 1901 and 1902, when there were two minor earthquakes.

		"description": "Every year on August 30, ocean enthusiasts come together to draw attention to whale sharks and advocate for them. These gentle giants have been around for more than 240 million years, but the first specimen was discovered off the coast of South Africa in the 1820s. As the world's largest fish, whale sharks can grow up to 12 metres, with one reaching a record 18.8 metres. Found in tropical oceans around the world, these filter feeders glide through the water, mouth wide open, straining plankton and small fish. Each pattern on their dotted, starry skin is as unique as a human fingerprint. Sadly, the International Union for Conservation of Nature lists whale sharks as endangered due to overfishing, habitat loss and climate change. Amid adversity, there's hope, like in Cenderawasih Bay in Indonesia, a whale shark oasis that's pictured here. Here, these titans dine on the generosity of fishermen who feed them baitfish for luck, reflecting a unique bond between man and marine life.",

Spanish explorer Alvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca might have been the first European to see the falls. In 1907, businessman Domingo Ayarragaray saw the potential of this area and built a hotel and roads. The falls became such a sensation that they were designated as national parks on both countries—Argentina's Iguazu National Park in 1934 and Brazil's Iguaçu National Park in 1939.

Despite being able to exist in an array of environments and water temperatures, dolphins are threatened by a variety of human activities, such as hunting, pollution and fishing. Hunting in particular led to the creation of World Dolphin Day in 2022 by Sea Shepherd Global, an international marine conservation group.\nThe pod of dolphins seen in today's image was photographed near Réunion, an island in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Madagascar. A wide variety of marine wildlife can be found year-round in Réunion's deeper waters, including many types of sharks, orcas, humpback whales, sea turtles and of course, dolphins. The island's warm, tropical climate is ideal for these creatures, and spinner, bottlenose and rough-toothed dolphins swim in the island's crystal-clear waters.",

This stunning 71,028-acre (28,744-hectare) coastal haven on the Point Reyes Peninsula in Marin County, pictured in today's images, is a gem of the Californian coastline in the United States, boasting breathtaking views and diverse wildlife. Filled with scenic trails that wind through lush forests and along rugged cliffs, Point Reyes has much to offer its visitors.\nFamously recognised as the most wind-swept spot on the Pacific Coast and the second most foggy area in North America, Point Reyes has a fascinating historical background. The Point Reyes Lighthouse was constructed in 1870 to address the frequent shipwrecks in its treacherous coastal waters. This iconic landmark served as a crucial navigation aid for more than 100 years before being replaced by an automated light in 1975. Today, the lighthouse remains a key element of Point Reyes' charm and continues to be a favourite attraction. Whether you're spotting elephant seals, hiking to the picturesque Point Reyes Lighthouse, or simply soaking in the serene beauty of the rolling waves, there's something for everyone.",

The Last Night typically kicks off with a selection of classical favourites performed by top orchestras and soloists. Expect the second half of the evening to get properly patriotic, with anthems like 'Land of Hope and Glory' and 'Rule, Britannia!,' inspiring a joyous sing-along.

Wallabies have around 30 different species, including brush wallabies, rock-wallabies, hare-wallabies, nail-tail wallabies and swamp wallabies. These agile and sprightly mammals are herbivores, nibbling on grasses, leaves and fruits. With a height of 30 to 104 centimetres, wallabies have strong hind legs that help them take impressive leaps and serve as a defence against predators. During mating season, male wallabies engage in boxing bouts to show dominance in an attempt to grab females' attention. Social creatures, wallabies form small groups called 'mobs,' which provide safety and mutual grooming. Their playgrounds are forests that echo with the thudding of their hops as they navigate their home range with ease.",

Initially an inside joke, Talk Like a Pirate Day gained popularity after the duo shared the idea with humourist Dave Barry in 2002, who promoted it in his syndicated column. Since then, it's become a day of fun and parodic celebration—people don pirate costumes, engage in pirate-themed activities, like the kid on the ship in today's image, and embrace mock pirate language.

He spent much of his final days on Ocracoke Island until his death in 1718. The island's residents speak the unique 'Hoi Toider' dialect, a blend of Elizabethan English, Irish and Scottish accents.

		"description": "Autumn is in the air—officially. The September equinox marks the transition from the lush summer to the mellow autumn in the Northern Hemisphere, while in the Southern Hemisphere, it signals the beginning of spring. The term 'equinox' is derived from Latin, meaning 'equal night.' During this moment, the Earth's axis is perpendicular to the sun, meaning it rises due east and sets due west, a rare moment of global balance. This balance occurs because the Earth's axis is neither tilted toward nor away from the sun.\nLet's explore Buttermere in England's Lake District that mirrors this equinox enchantment with its tranquil waters and storied shores in today's image. Here, a Norse leader, Jarl Buthar, once defied Norman conquests during the 12th century. Some people think Buttermere's name may come from Buthar, but the more likely explanation is the nearby dairy pastures; Buttermere literally means 'the lake by the dairy pastures.' The lake, approximately 1.2 miles long, is not only a National Trust treasure but also the perfect place to take a break from the hustle and let nature refresh your spirit.",

These clever critters are smart as well as cute: they use rocks to crack open shellfish, making them one of the few animals that use tools. There used to be as many as 300,000 in the wild, but they were heavily hunted for almost two centuries, as their dense fur was highly prized. By 1911, it is thought that only around 2,000 were left. Thankfully, an international hunting ban, conservation efforts and reintroduction programs have helped them rebound, and they are now found in about two-thirds of their historic habitat.

European whalers first visited Svalbard in 1611, and Norway and Russia still use the islands for coal production. Today, however, tourists also visit the islands.

She was a pioneering nurse who made significant contributions during the Crimean War, setting up the 'British Hotel' near the front lines to provide care to soldiers. So, as Black History Month rolls around each year, let's remember that the journey doesn't stop when the month ends.",

A tradition since 1994, it unites people from bustling cities to serene lochs in a celebration of verse on the first Thursday of every October. Founded by William Sieghart, this event aims to make poetry more visible and engaging. It's a day when Prince Charles might recite Seamus Heaney, and train announcement boards become stanzas of TS Eliot and Auden. Everyday spaces transform into stages for the spoken word—a railway station or supermarket might suddenly echo with an epic. This year the special day focuses on the theme of 'counting.' So today, our image of Loch Morlich in Cairngorms National Park, Scotland provides the perfect backdrop for finding poetic inspiration. Why not let poetry alight upon your day?",

As well as helping us to understand the universe we live in, space exploration has played an important role in helping scientists develop new medicines, create new power sources and even improve farming techniques. This year's theme is Space and Climate Change; events will be held in 83 countries to celebrate the vital role that space technology plays in understanding and monitoring how Earth's climate is changing.\nSpace exploration has also led to amazing photographs of our solar system, like the one featured here today. Europa is one of Jupiter's 95 known moons. Its surface is mainly made up of frozen water, which has broken up and refrozen, creating the patterns seen on its surface. In fact, although Europa is just a quarter of the size of Earth, it may contain two times the amount of water found in our planet's oceans. Space Week is the perfect time to take a moment to appreciate the wonders of our solar system and beyond!",

It was discovered in 1999 around Rapa Island in the South Pacific and is known for the 'fake eyes' or ocelli—vibrant blue and yellow rings—between its eyes and arms. Found in the Indo-Pacific region, including Indonesia, Australia and Okinawa in Japan, mototi octopuses are masters of disguise. They usually have a dull orange-cream-brown colour but when alarmed, they can quickly shift to striking maroon with white stripes along their body and arms. Also known as poison ocellate octopuses, these cephalopods are highly venomous.

Found across the western states, especially in Utah and Colorado, these trees are the most widespread native species in North America. Their autumn foliage is breathtaking, with their leaves turning a vibrant yellow that lights up the landscape, as seen in today's photo, which was taken near Marble, Colorado. Aspens are not only beautiful but also biologically fascinating. They grow in large colonies that originate from a single root system, making them some of the largest living organisms on Earth.\nEach tree in the colony is genetically identical. When an aspen tree is cut down or damaged, the root system remains alive, allowing new shoots to emerge and grow, which helps create a resilient network that can survive harsh conditions, including wildfires. This species quickly colonises areas that have been recently burned down and can regenerate even after frequent fires. Aspen trees are more than just a treat for the eyes; they are an example of nature's resilience.",

The hidden valleys of Sorano are home to the Vie Cave, an intricate network of pathways possibly used as a defence system against invaders and wild animals.

The tiny ruby-throated hummingbird, weighing less than a penny, and makes the trip all the way across the Gulf of Mexico—a seemingly impossible feat for its size. Migratory birds navigate the globe, instinctively knowing when and where to move to exploit seasonal abundance. The Arctic tern outshines them all with its intercontinental journey from pole to pole, covering more than 18,000 miles. Their migration routes are passages created based on environmental cues.\nLet's take a moment to admire the vibrant plumage of the wood duck, photographed in Quebec, Canada and featured here today. Wood ducks, like the one in today's image, nest in tree cavities close to water and sometime take advantage of man-made boxes. During the breeding season, from February to April, you'll find the females laying 7-15 eggs. After breeding in the eastern and western United States and southern Canada, these ducks migrate southward in autumn to avoid harsh winter conditions. By October and November, they move towards milder climates in the southeastern United States and occasionally into Mexico.",

The Royal Alcázar of Seville, in the southern region of Andalusia, stands on the site of a 10th century citadel, which was expanded over the following 200 years. When Christian forces captured the city in 1248, the Alcázar was almost totally rebuilt in the Mudejar style, which takes inspiration from the intricate patterns and decorative motifs found in Islamic architecture. Within the Alcázar, there are several courtyards lined with delicately carved columns. One of these is the Patio de las Doncellas, or Courtyard of the Maidens, pictured here today.\nIn the centre of this beautiful space is a pool, whose still waters provide reflections of not only the blue Andalucian sky above, but of the intricate latticework of the courtyard's arches. Look a little closer at these arches, and you'll see carved shells, Hands of Fatima—a symbol said to bring protection—plants and Arabic script. Behind the columns, the walls are decorated with colourful ceramic times decorated with geometric patterns. These tiles, known as 'azulejos,' are a hallmark of Andalusian decoration.

The great migration, considered one of the seven wonders of the natural world, is a safari spectacle where survival is the prize. One of the most dramatic moments of the migration is the crossing of the Mara River.\nThousands of wildebeests gather at the riverbank, aware that danger lurks beneath the surface—the crocodiles—not to mention the lions and leopards that patrol the banks. When the first wildebeest takes the plunge, it's a wild rush as the rest of the herd follows, creating a chaotic scene. Some make it across, while others become part of the food chain.

Sloths are mainly leaf eaters, although they also snack on fruits and tree sap to keep them going. To help them break down those tough, fibrous leaves, they have a special multi-chambered stomach. With their super slow metabolism, digestion takes its sweet time, and they don't need much food each day to get by.

		"description": "At the top of the Spanish Steps in Rome, take a left underneath the imposing Catholic church. Down an unassuming side street, there's a surprise waiting for you: a house of monsters. Welcome to the Palazzo Zuccari, a 16th-century palace where myths seem to come to life on its façade—grotesque faces swallow up its doors and windows. Federico Zuccari, who built the palace, was well-versed in monsters. His painting of the Last Judgement in Florence Cathedral and his illustrations of Dante's Inferno are replete with mythical beings.\nThe monster door originally led to the palazzo's garden because Zuccari enjoyed making his guests experience the contrast between the scary entrance and the beautiful serenity of the garden. These days, the door leads to the Bibliotheca Hertziana, a library specialising in Italian art history, from the Middle Ages to the modern day, which has occupied the site of the garden since 1912. If you're looking for more monstrous mouths in Rome, not far from the Palazzo Zuccari is the Bocca della Verità, an ancient Roman mask. According to legend, it will bite off any liar's hand that's placed in its mouth.",

		"description": "Madame Sherri Forest in Chesterfield in New Hampshire, United States, is a captivating destination steeped in history and natural beauty. It was once the site of an extravagant house built in the 1930s by Madame Antoinette Sherri, a flamboyant 1920s costume designer known for her lavish parties. Madame Sherri's dramatic arrivals in town, often in a chauffeur-driven Packard, draped in furs, became the talk of the locals. As her fortune declined, her 'castle' fell into disrepair and was vandalised. In 1959, she returned to find her property in ruins and never came back. A fire destroyed the house in 1963, leaving behind only the stone foundation, an iconic staircase and a large fireplace leading to a lone chimney.\nToday, the forest where her house once stood spans over 500 acres (200 hectares) and offers scenic hiking trails through woodlands, hemlock groves and around peaceful brooks, a picturesque setting for outdoor enthusiasts. Managed by the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests, this area was named in honour of Madame Sherri and it also includes trails that lead to the ruins of her former estate. So, while the house was originally separate from the forest, the two are now intricately entwined.",

		"description": "In the ghostly silence of Bodie in California, United States, it feels like time stands still. This once-booming gold rush town was established in 1860. Bodie was named after WS Bodey, a prospector who discovered gold but tragically died in a blizzard before seeing the town's rise. When large deposits of gold were found there, it grew to nearly 10,000 residents, with saloons, dance halls and breweries lining its streets. But as the gold ran dry, so did the town's fortunes. The mines closed, the population dwindled, and by 1915, the place was abandoned. Bodie's streets are now empty, its wooden buildings frozen in decay.\nToday, Bodie is one of America's best-preserved ghost towns. Wandering through the streets, you can peer into dusty homes and storefronts, and even find small artefacts like shards of china and square nails from the glory days. Legend has it that Bodie's ghosts fiercely guard the town, and those who take souvenirs risk being cursed with bad luck. If that doesn't scare you, taking items home is against the park's rules. So, if you find yourself here, be sure to leave with nothing but memories—lest the town's spirits follow you home.",

The towering presence of Mont Blanc, seen in this image, has left an indelible mark on literature, most notably on Mary Shelley's 'Frankenstein.' The last Friday of October is Frankenstein Friday, honouring Shelley's literary genius and the fascinating creature born from her imagination. 'Frankenstein' was conceived during a ghost story challenge. In 1816, an 18-year-old Shelley, along with fellow writers Percy Bysshe Shelley, John Polidori and Lord Byron, spent a stormy summer in Switzerland. There, she penned the tale of Victor Frankenstein and the Creature. A pivotal scene in the novel takes place on a glacier near Mont Blanc, where Victor is confronted by his monstrous creation. This setting, with its surreal beauty and treacherous terrain, perfectly captures a sense of awe and terror.\n'Frankenstein,' also known as 'Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus,' was first published anonymously in 1818. Shelley's use of the epistolary form—a novel told through letters—and her blend of Gothic and early science fiction made 'Frankenstein' a timeless classic.",

At 2 AM this morning, the clocks fell back one hour, meaning there was an extra hour of sleep. While the idea of summer time was mentioned in 1784 by American inventor Benjamin Franklin, the first serious proposal for changing the clocks in the United Kingdom came from British builder William Willett in 1907. He valued having more daylight and felt so strongly about this that he published a pamphlet called 'The Waste of Daylight. Over time, many countries adopted the practice to give people more daylight in the evenings during the summer months.\nThe clock in today's image is of the Balmoral Hotel in Edinburgh, Scotland. This famous clock hasn't been on time since 1902, by three minutes, to be exact. The move was made to lessen the likelihood that the people would miss their trains. However, it does align with Greenwich Mean Time once a year, on December 31.",

Originally from Ireland and Scotland, this craft was taken to America by immigrants who initially used turnips and potatoes to create lanterns, but later found pumpkins more plentiful and easier to carve. By hollowing out pumpkins and lighting them with candles, they transformed the gourds into flickering defences against evil spirits.\nToday's image shows a pumpkin field in Victoria in British Columbia, Canada. Across the United Kingdom, from the sprawling fields of Lincolnshire in England to West Glamorgan in Wales , farms are full of this orange fruit. They become canvases for masterpieces, with ghoulish and whimsical displays gracing porches to welcome trick-or-treaters. As people gather to scoop, carve and light their pumpkins, they take part in a shared ritual that transcends cultures. Beyond their porch-light duties, pumpkins fill pies and spice up lattes, adding an element to the season that many anticipate all year long. Once merely a fruit, the pumpkin now enjoys a revered place in Halloween celebrations.",

With its keen vision, eerie vocalisations and silent flight, this owl has historically been revered and feared. In folklore and mythology, owls were considered symbols of wisdom and omens of death. On Samhain, the Celtic precursor to Halloween, the owl was believed to be the kin of roaming spirits.\nThe owl in today's image is far more than a character in ghostly tales. Often called the 'tiger of the air,' the great horned owl, named for its signature feathers that look like horns, is one of the most fearsome and adaptable predators in the ornithological world. Primarily active at night, the owl has large, powerful talons that exert around 2,100 kilopascals of pressure, which it uses to grab prey like small rodents and skunks. It has incredible night vision, but its eyes are fixed, so it must turn its head a whopping 270 degrees to see everything. So, whether you hear it hooting from treetops or see it flying in the night, this owl proves that not all scary apparitions are supernatural.",

Positioned high on an extinct volcano, these fortress walls have seen wars, royal births, executions and plenty of other drama since the 11th century. But what really sets it apart is its reputation as one of Scotland's most haunted spots. It's no surprise that with more than 1,000 years of history, some have reported ghost sightings.\nLegend has it that the Grey Lady, Janet Douglas, roams the castle's corridors. Also known as Lady Glamis, a noblewoman accused of witchcraft by King James V, she is believed to still lament her fiery execution in 1537. Others say the Grey Lady might be the ghost of Marie de Guise—mother of Mary, Queen of Scots—mourning her lost power amid the turmoil of religious reform. Then there's the Dung Man, a prisoner who attempted to escape in a wheelbarrow full of excrement. He died from the fall when the cart was emptied from the castle wall. The lost piper, who vanished into underground tunnels, continues to play a haunting melody beneath the city. And in 2001, the shadowy figure of a man in a leather apron emerged during a paranormal research project, leaving volunteers with a chilling memory. Spooked yet?",

		"description": "Red as far as the eye can see and clear blue skies overhead. Welcome to Arches National Park, Utah in the United States. The story of this otherworldly landscape starts 65 million years ago when a dry seabed stood here. Over time, geological forces warped and squeezed the land, twisting the sandstone into lumps and bumps. Later, wind and water carved out the arches, pinnacles, fins and balanced rocks that now stand in this area. The park has more than 2,000 natural stone arches, the highest concentration of these structures anywhere on Earth. In today's image, we can see two of them: Double Arch, photographed through Cove Arch. The larger arch of Double Arch spans nearly 44 metres and is over 30 metres tall, the tallest and second-longest of the park's arches.",

Blind at birth, these little ones are vulnerable in the first few weeks of their lives and depend entirely on their mothers. At around eight weeks old, they meet the rest of the pride.

Built between the 12th and 13th centuries on the Île de la Cité—an island in the Seine—Notre-Dame has witnessed centuries of French history, from the Hundred Years' War to the French Revolution, and beyond. Although it was chosen by Napoleon as the site of his coronation as emperor in 1804, by the early 19th century, the cathedral was in a state of disrepair. However, one novel changed its fortunes: 'The Hunchback of Notre-Dame' by Victor Hugo. The popularity of this book helped encourage a restoration project that renewed the cathedral's former beauty.",

Though destroyed during the Swabian War in 1499, the castle's tower has been restored multiple times and stands today as a proud reminder of its past. In 1975, Ardez was chosen as a Swiss model village for its exceptional preservation efforts, which have kept its historic charm intact.\nThe nearby Chastè site is a treasure trove of history, recognised as a Swiss heritage site of national significance. This fascinating location encompasses layers of human settlement, from the late Bronze Age through the early Iron Age and even includes artefacts from the Roman Empire. Against this backdrop, the star trails in today's photo illuminate the timeless allure of Ardez, where history and natural beauty converge.",

		"description": "'Don't adventures ever have an end? I suppose not. Someone else always has to carry on the story.' Today, on Tolkien Day, fans around the world honour the master storyteller who crafted the epic adventures of Middle-earth: JRR Tolkien. While Tolkien may have started the tale, it's his readers who carry it forward, generation after generation, diving into the pages of 'The Hobbit,' 'The Lord of the Rings,' and beyond. Tolkienists are encouraged to celebrate the author's birthday with a toast at 9 PM local time—to participate, all you must do is stand and raise a glass of your choice, say 'The Professor,' and take a sip.\nFor today's featured image, it is only fitting to visit a place that might have inspired the literary legend: the Radcliffe Camera, or Rad Cam, at the University of Oxford in England. Originally a science library, the domed, circular building now serves as a reading room for the Bodleian Library. This 18th-century building is said to be an inspiration for Sauron's temple to Morgoth on Númenor in Tolkien's fiction. Though Tolkien himself didn't study there—he was a student at Exeter College—he would have passed by the Rad Cam countless times during his years as a professor of English Language and Literature at Oxford. This building, with its extraordinary exterior, continues to captivate visitors and Tolkien enthusiasts alike.",

Over 25 metres tall and nearly 300 metres wide, it holds the distinction of being the widest waterfall in Vietnam. Located just 169 miles north of Hanoi, this waterfall has gradually worn away its crest over the years, inching upstream. For most of the year, they flow as two distinct cascades, but come summer, when the rains swell the river, they merge into one big fall.\nEven with better roads, easier public transport and drone videos showing off the jaw-dropping beauty of the falls, Bản Giốc remains refreshingly off the beaten path.

This Romanesque church, originally built in 450 CE, features a sturdy square bell tower added in the 9th century, enhancing the basilica's exterior. Its design features three naves, divided by two rows of 12 columns each. Featured in today's image is the basilica's real showstopper: the basement crypt, or a burial chamber, is a stunning model of early religious design. Complete with vaulted ceilings that slope down into rows of stone columns, its floor is a work of art itself. It's inlaid with beautifully intricate mosaic tiles that have withstood the test of time.\nBuilt on soft marshland, Ravenna faces ongoing structural challenges because the entire city is gradually sinking. This is particularly evident in the crypt, which now remains perpetually submerged under about a foot of water. But instead of battling the slow flood, Ravenna has embraced it, filling the pool with goldfish that glide between the ancient columns and above the submerged mosaics. Visitors here often toss coins into the water, likely wishing for good luck, making this crypt more of a wishing well than a burial site.",

		"description": "Are you ready to rock the new year? Today is Old Rock Day, a day for celebrating and learning about old rocks and fossils. Although rocks are common, few of us take the time to consider how amazing they are. Forged in volcanoes or moulded by millennia of pressure, these solid masses of minerals hold the key to understanding how our planet formed. Rocks can also contain fossils, the remnants of long-extinct organisms, which give scientists clues about what creatures and plants have lived on Earth during its 4.5-billion-year history. The United Kingdom, with its rich geological diversity, provides a front-row seat to the ancient forces that shaped our planet. On the Jurassic Coast in Dorset and East Devon, rocks over 180 million years old tell tales of dinosaurs, ancient seas and volcanic activity. And don't forget the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland, with its impressive columns of basalt.\nOne of the world's most curious rock displays can be found on Koekohe Beach in New Zealand. The Moeraki Boulders, some of which are more than 2 metres in diameter, have been shaped by nature over millions of years. Each boulder started as a pebble on the seabed around 65 million years ago. Over time, layers of mud and silt built up around them, cemented together by calcite. Thanks to erosion and the movement of the sea, the boulders eventually emerged. Today, new boulders are still appearing, while the elements are slowly breaking down existing ones.",

A salt and clay pan surrounded by towering dunes, Sossusvlei tells a story of contrasts. Every 10 years or so, an extraordinary event occurs when the Tsauchab River floods the pan, transforming it into a stunning turquoise lake.

Created in 1972, Abraham Lake is a man-made reservoir that spans more than 20 square miles along the North Saskatchewan River. Thanks to glacier-fed waters from the Rocky Mountains, the lake stays transparent even in the coldest months. The glacial meltwater carries fine sediment that scatters sunlight, while natural filtration through rocks keeps pollutants to a minimum.\nThe snowy season attracts photographers and visitors from around the world who are eager to capture a rare sight at Preacher's Point: the bubbles. These frozen globes form when microorganisms break down dead plants and animals on the lake bed, releasing methane. As the gas rises, it gets trapped by the ice, creating layers of bubbles in various sizes and shapes. It's wild to think that they're flammable and chilling under your feet. The ice is thickest in January and February, making the bubbles clearly visible. If you're planning to check it out, just remember to stick close to the shoreline for your safety.",

Meknes reflects the Moroccan style of architecture, with one of its most impressive landmarks being Heri es-Swani, seen in today's image.\nHeri es-Swani was originally constructed as a stable and for storing vast amounts of grain to sustain the settlement and the Sultan's armies. Its design was both practical and impressive—thick walls and an innovative cooling system helped maintain the food supply. Twenty-two rows of symmetrical arches divided the space into corridors that used to have vaulted ceilings. Back then, mules climbed onto the roof terrace to deliver grain, which was then dropped through specially designed holes in the ceiling below. The structure housed more than 12,000 horses. Today, it stands as an empty shell, acting as a scenic backdrop ready to be explored. This historical monument is a must-see for anyone curious about how empires were built and fed.",

As part of this tradition, Calennig, meaning 'New Year's gift' in Welsh, plays a central role, linking the celebration to customs from the Julian calendar era. Even after most of the world switched to the Gregorian calendar in 1582, some Welsh communities clung to their old ways. Traditionally, the day involves children going door-to-door, singing songs and offering good wishes in exchange for gifts like coins, food or sweets. A unique feature is its clove-decorated apples. These aren't for snacking, though; they're miniature symbols of luck and prosperity.\nWhile these old traditions have evolved in some parts of Wales, the spirit of Calennig thrives. Cities like Cardiff, the capital of Wales, have transformed the celebration into large-scale events, complete with fireworks, markets and community gatherings. If your New Year's resolutions are already wobbling by January 13, Calennig offers a do-over. So why not embrace a little Welsh magic?

The story begins with Sir Hans Sloane, an Anglo-Irish physician and avid collector. His collection of more than 71,000 items, ranging from books and manuscripts to botanical samples and antiquities, formed the museum's foundation. Fast forward 266 years, the museum houses more than 8 million objects, the largest collection of artefacts in the world, although only about 1% of the collection is currently on display. Its treasures span continents and millennia, from the Rosetta Stone—key to deciphering ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs—to the Parthenon Marbles, the Benin Bronzes and samurai armour.\nMoreover, the museum has embraced modernity with virtual tours, interactive exhibits and even TikTok moments, proving that history isn't stuck in the past.

It all began in 1908 when President Theodore Roosevelt designated the area as a national monument. Later in 2013, Pinnacles earned its status as a national park. As we celebrate the anniversary of its establishment today, let's take a moment to appreciate this landscape. This land owes its formations to an ancient volcanic eruption that occurred 23 million years ago. The fiery beginnings made towering spires, cliffs and talus caves, created by falling boulders wedged into narrow canyons. Over millennia, tectonic forces shifted the landmass northward, leaving the park far from its volcanic birthplace. Talk about a journey!\nThis place offers a variety of trails, from easy walks to challenging climbs. The High Peaks Trail, featured in today's image, tests your stamina with steep climbs and narrow passages, while Bear Gulch Reservoir provides a more relaxed stroll. Moreover, Pinnacles is home to a range of wildlife including bobcats, jackrabbits and black-tailed deer and bird species like woodpeckers and bats, making it attractive for wildlife enthusiasts.

Although it's the smallest of the eight pelican species worldwide, it's still a large bird, measuring more than a metre in length and having a wingspan of nearly two metres. It's a marine-dwelling species and can be spotted along the Atlantic coast of the Americas, from New Jersey to the mouth of the Amazon River. On the Pacific coast, it can be spotted from British Columbia all the way to Peru, including a stop at the Galapagos Islands.\nThe brown pelican is a piscivore, meaning its diet mainly consists of fish. American poet Dixon Lanier Merritt's limerick famously begins, 'A wonderful bird is the pelican; his bill can hold more than his belly can,' and it's spot on—its pouch can store up to three times the volume of its stomach. This versatile feature acts as a scoop, a tool for cooling off during hot weather and a feeding trough for young pelicans. The brown pelican faced near extinction twice, first due to hunting and later from the impact of pesticides like DDT.",

The entire cave complex stretches on for around 2.5 miles, although visitors can only access about 300 metres of the total. Inside, there's a labyrinth of lit pathways winding past stalactite and stalagmite formations, leading to a 119-metre-long saltwater lake.\nNeptune's Grotto is near the town of Alghero on the northwest coast of Sardinia, the second largest island in the Mediterranean. It has been inhabited for at least 10,000 years, but its most important ancient civilisation, the Nuragic peoples, lived there from around 1800 BCE until the 2nd century CE. At this time, villages were built around nuraghes, a kind of round tower fortress. Today, there are still around 7,000 of these nuraghes across the island, and they have become a symbol of Sardinia.

		"description": "What's that long, bushy tail scurrying across the branches? Chances are, it's a squirrel. These little rodents are found across most of the globe, and today is their special day: Squirrel Appreciation Day. This unofficial holiday was started by a North Carolina wildlife rehabilitator to encourage people to leave out seeds and nuts for these critters. From the tiny least pygmy squirrel—just 14 centimetres long—to the Bhutan giant flying squirrel at more than a metre, these mammals come in all shapes and sizes.\nToday's image features a Eurasian red squirrel, photographed in the Netherlands. The red squirrel can be found across Europe and Russia, from western Spain and Portugal all the way to eastern Siberia. Their diet mainly consists of nuts, fungi, seeds and berries, but they will occasionally eat birds' eggs. In addition to being the national mammal of Denmark, they also play a part in old Norse mythology. Ratatoskr is a red squirrel who scurries up and down Yggdrasil, the sacred tree, carrying messages and spreading gossip. So, next time you spot a red squirrel, it could just be a furry little messenger!",

Tucked in the heart of Jordan's arid desert landscapes, this ancient city once thrived as the capital of the Nabataean Kingdom in the 2nd century BCE. It was also a hub of the spice trade, connecting distant regions like China, Egypt, Greece and India. The city was abandoned for around 500 years before being rediscovered in 1812, earning it the 'Lost City' moniker.\nAd-Deir, seen in today's image, dates to the 1st century CE. Its design is characterised by a combination of Hellenistic and Mesopotamian influences. Although the exact purpose of the structure is debated, it's believed to have been used as a church during the Byzantine period. Standing nearly 45 metres tall and 50 metres wide, its massive facade is carved directly into the sandstone cliffs, showcasing the Nabataeans' ingenious craftsmanship and architecture. The journey to this landmark involves a steep hike up 800 stone steps, winding through rocky terrain. At the top, you're rewarded with panoramic views of the rugged Petra valley that make the climb more than worth it.",

Thorrablot, Iceland's midwinter festival, invites you to dive headfirst into tradition. This celebration of survival, culture, and community, which dates to the Viking Age, was once a way for Icelanders to honour Thor, the Norse god of thunder. Today, people celebrate by gathering to feast on an array of local delicacies, including fermented shark, smoked lamb, rye bread and shots of Brennivín—often called 'black death' schnapps.\nStrokkur geyser—featured in the image—warms up winter in a completely different way. Located in the geothermal area beside the Hvítá River, this geyser erupts every 6 to 10 minutes, shooting hot water 14 to 20 metres into the air, sometimes erupting up to 40 metres. It has been consistently active since 1963. There is science behind its eruption—magma beneath the Earth's crust heats groundwater until the pressure builds up, forcing the water explosively to the surface. Both Thorrablot and Strokkur celebrate Iceland's resilience—one through its people and the other through its land.",

Born on this day in 1759, his work blends sharp insight, emotion and cultural pride. Although much of his writing was in Scots, he also used English, ensuring his voice reached far beyond the country. Burns Night isn't just a party—it's a celebration of Scotland's cultural heritage, recognised by the Scottish Parliament, and highlights the richness of the Scots language.\nBurns' connection to Dumfries, a market town, is an important part of his legacy. He moved to Dumfriesshire in 1788 and settled in Dumfries in 1791, where he lived until his death in 1796. The town is home to the historic Devorgilla Bridge, pictured here, also known as Dumfries Old Bridge. Once a road bridge, it now serves pedestrians and stands as a reminder of the time Burns spent there. The bridge we see today contains remnants dating back to the early 1430s, with its stone structure likely completed by 1432.",

It's home to some stunning geographic features, like Zoroaster Temple, featured in today's image. This towering over 2,100-metre summit is in Coconino County, Arizona, United States. The peak was named after the ancient Iranian prophet Zoroaster by George Wharton James, an American photographer and journalist, and Clarence Dutton, an American geologist.

Found on all continents except Antarctica and Australia, it's one of the most widely distributed bird species. This raptor belongs to the genus Asio, whose members are characterised by feather tufts ('ears') on their head. The short-eared owl only reveals its tufts when feeling defensive.\nBecause of the irregular wingbeats, its flight is on the floppy side, much like a moth or bat. It likes to glide a few metres above the ground in open fields and grasslands, swooping down feet first to grab its prey. Owls primarily hunt at night, but this silent hunter is also active during the day and at dusk. Its daylight hunts often line up with the peak activity of small rodents called voles—its favourite meal. Known to relocate to areas with higher rodent populations, the short-eared owl even wanders nomadically in search of better food supplies during years when vole populations are low.",

The 'Burgrave Gebhard vom Stein' is first mentioned in a document of King Wenceslas I of Bohemia in 1233, presumably referring to Königstein. At that time the area belonged to the Kingdom of Bohemia. In the 16th century, the castle underwent significant expansion to become a Saxon state fortress, with the start of construction of the imposing 152.5-metre-deep castle well between 1566 and 1569 being an important milestone. It is still one of the deepest historic wells in Germany.\nDuring the Dresden May Uprising in 1849, Königstein once again offered refuge to the Saxon royal family, and after the uprising was crushed, the arrested revolutionaries were brought to the fortress's state prison. During the First and Second World Wars, the fortress also served as a large prisoner of war camp. Until 1955 it was used as a youth work centre for the rehabilitation of young offenders, before being opened as a museum and attracting many visitors. In the winter months, Königstein Fortress is transformed into a fairytale winter wonderland, with frost turning the old walls into glistening works of art. No wonder this natural gem inspired Caspar David Friedrich to paint his 'Wanderer above the Sea of Fog.'",

Weighing between 1.9 and 7 kilograms, they are easily recognised by their round faces, short tails and dense fur that helps them endure chilly mountain climates. When it comes to food, these creatures are herbivores with simple taste. They spend their summer days grazing on grasses, herbs, roots, seeds and flowers, storing up energy for their big event: a roughly nine-month hibernation party. Sometimes they eat grain, worms, insects and spiders. Beyond their hibernation habits, alpine marmots live a highly social lifestyle. They communicate through a variety of vocal sounds, including sharp whistles to warn the group of predators like eagles or foxes. This strong sense of community is key to their survival.",

Made mostly of Entrada Sandstone, it has the same geological roots as nearby sites like Romana Mesa, its parent peak, and Gunsight Butte, another sandstone summit to the east.\nPart of the Lake Powell region, Alstrom Point extends southward into the vast waters of the lake, in between Padre Bay and Warm Creek Bay. When the lake is full, Alstrom Point towers nearly 300 metres above the water, offering views of the surrounding canyons. Lake Powell, spanning across Utah and Arizona, attracts around 3 million visitors every year. The lake is a maze of deep blue water winding through over 90 rock canyons. While its main stretch runs through Glen Canyon, it also snakes into over many smaller side canyons, along with the Escalante and San Juan rivers.",

		"description": "Today's image features one of the simplest yet most essential inventions in human history: the umbrella, or parasol. Over 4,000 years ago, in ancient Egypt, Assyria and China, these foldable canopies were first used to shield people from the sun. It wasn't until the 17th century that the umbrella, as we know it today, gained popularity in Europe, initially as a luxury item primarily for women. Fast-forward a few centuries, and these weather shields have become a staple in pop culture, too. Remember Mary Poppins with her iconic umbrella that helped her fly, or Rihanna's hit song 'Umbrella'?\nBeyond their functionality, they've also made their mark in art and fashion. They often feature in artistic installations, such as the vibrant display at Borough Market in London, seen in today's image. But have you ever wondered why so many of them are left behind on trains? They're among the most commonly lost items worldwide!",

This masterpiece of early Buddhist art is near Datong in Shanxi province, northeastern China. Carved into sandstone cliffs over 1,500 years ago during the Northern Wei dynasty (386–534/535 CE), the grottoes contain 254 caves. The highlight is the massive Buddha in Cave 5, which is over 15 metres tall. But don't stop there—each cave offers something unique. Some are like ancient storyboards, depicting tales from Buddhist scriptures, while others showcase detailed carvings of monks, deities, musicians and even scenes of daily life under Wei rule.\nCaves 16–20, known as the 'Tanyao Five Caves,' were the first to be carved at Yungang, overseen by the monk Tanyao. While you're there, be sure to explore Cave 20's seated Buddha idol in a meditation posture, with a standing attendant Buddha on one side. What's fascinating is that these caves blend influences from Indian, Central Asian and local Chinese Buddhist art. Whether you're a history lover or simply appreciate unique art, the Yungang Grottoes offer an unforgettable experience.",

		"description": "Today, we celebrate Darwin Day—a shout-out to Charles Darwin and his game-changing ideas about life on Earth. As an English naturalist, geologist and biologist, his theory of natural selection revolutionised our understanding of species, evolution and our role in the natural world. His work, 'On the Origin of Species,' published in 1859, laid the foundation for modern evolutionary biology. This day marks the birthday of Darwin and honours his genius while promoting curiosity, science and critical thinking. From thought-provoking talks to engaging exhibits, this day motivates us to keep exploring.\nSpeaking of cool science, marine iguanas, found only on the Galápagos Islands, serve as an example of Darwin's evolutionary principles. These reptiles, seen in today's image, are the only lizards in the world that forage in the sea, diving to graze on algae growing on submerged rocks. They've adapted in remarkable ways, from flattened tails for swimming to salt glands that allow them to expel seawater by sneezing. During his visit to the islands in 1835, Darwin noted their appearance as being like 'imps of darkness' but also recognised how perfectly they were adapted to their harsh environment.",

Over time, climate changes caused water levels to drop; these days, the lake is normally dry, except in winter when it's covered in around 5 centimetres of water. The name 'Tyrrell' comes from the local Wergaia word for 'sky,' a nod to the Boorong Aboriginal People's interest in astronomy. Spanning more than 70 square miles, Lake Tyrrell is a haven for wildlife, including Mallee reptiles, kangaroos and emus.\nIn recent years, the lake has become a tourist hotspot. People come from all over the world during the winter months, drawn by its mirror-like surface that reflects the endless Australian sky, making it the perfect photo op. The salt formations on the lakebed also provide a stunning backdrop for photographs. At night, it becomes the perfect place for stargazing, offering the chance to marvel at the constellations of the Southern Hemisphere.",

With over 100 species spread across the globe, kingfishers are found in a variety of habitats, from dense forests to coastal regions. Most species, like the common kingfisher, prefer freshwater environments across Europe, Asia and Africa, while others, such as the belted kingfisher, are found in North and South America. These birds are instantly recognisable by their vibrant plumage, often featuring a striking mix of blues, greens and oranges.\nTrue to their name, kingfishers are masters of the art of fishing. Perched patiently above water, they spot their prey with exceptional vision. Once a fish comes into view, they dive with precision, snatching their meal with a quick snap of their long, pointed beak. Unlike most birds, kingfishers don't build nests in trees. Instead, they dig burrows into riverbanks, creating tunnels that lead to cosy chambers where they lay their eggs. Kingfishers have been celebrated in myths and folklore for centuries. In many cultures, they are symbols of prosperity, peace and sharp intuition.",

A single square centimetre of their fur can hold more than 70,000 hairs, making it one of nature's most effective insulators. River otters were once endangered due to pollution and habitat loss. Yet, thanks to conservation efforts, their populations are rebounding in many regions across Europe.\nOtters are naturally playful, often sliding down snowy or muddy banks and diving underwater to find pebbles to play with. These solitary creatures communicate using a repertoire of whistles, squeaks and even scent, which also helps them mark their territorial boundaries.

Polar bears are native to the Arctic and can be found in Alaska, Russia, Greenland and Svalbard.\nThey're also found in Canada—like the cub in today's image, photographed in Churchill, Manitoba. Polar bears spend over half of their time hunting for seals on the sea ice, although they usually catch just one or two for every 10 that they try to catch. Their reliance on sea ice for hunting means that they are highly vulnerable to climate change. Sea ice is rapidly disappearing as the planet heats up, and polar bears are at risk of malnutrition and starvation as their hunting grounds vanish. Shrinking ice sheets also mean that these bears have to swim farther to find food, which depletes their energy reserves.

		"description": "A leek, a daffodil and a day to remember: Happy Saint David's Day! Today, Wales celebrates its patron saint and all things Welsh. Saint David was a 6th-century monk, bishop and preacher who played a key role in spreading Christianity across the country. He founded several religious communities known for their simple, disciplined lifestyles. One of his most famous sayings, 'Gwnewch y pethau bychain,' still resonates today as a reminder that small acts of kindness and faith matter. But why do people wear leeks and daffodils? Legend has it that the saint advised Welsh soldiers to wear leeks on their helmets to distinguish themselves from the enemy in battle against the Saxons. The daffodil, meanwhile, became popular later as a more visually appealing national emblem, especially during the 19th century.\nSo, what better place to visit today than St Davids Cathedral in St Davids, Britain's smallest city. Built on the site of Saint David's original monastic settlement, the cathedral has been a focal point of worship and pilgrimage for over a thousand years. With its sturdy Romanesque architecture and centuries-old traditions, it remains a testament to the saint's enduring legacy.",

This year's theme is 'Wildlife Conservation Finance: Investing in People and Planet.'\nThe events emphasise exchanging ideas, presenting solutions and diving into how innovative finance can help stop biodiversity loss and create a more sustainable future. Schools, conservation groups and wildlife parks host events such as nature walks, workshops, art contests, wildlife photography competitions and conservation talks to raise awareness. One species worth learning about is the southern yellow-billed hornbill, pictured here, a bird found throughout Southern Africa and commonly spotted in Kruger National Park in South Africa. Recognisable by its bright yellow, curved bill, this bird is often seen hopping on the ground in search of food. Its diet includes insects, seeds, fruits, berries, nuts and small reptiles, making it a key player in the ecosystem as both a predator and seed disperser. Social creatures, these hornbills are usually found in pairs or small groups, often foraging together. Their calls—whistling, grunting and cackling—echo across the savanna.",

Rooted in ancient Roman celebrations like Saturnalia, Mardi Gras evolved as Christianity spread, blending local customs—most notably Carnival festivities—with religious observances. The name itself originates from French, with the word gras meaning 'fat,' referring to rich, fatty foods like meat, eggs and cheese that are traditionally enjoyed before the fasting season begins.\nNew Orleans is synonymous with Mardi Gras, a tradition celebrated there since 1699. Today, colourful parades, masked revelers and iconic krewes define the city's celebration. Jackson Square, in the French Quarter, featured in today's image, stands as a witness to these lively traditions. Established in the early 1800s, it remains a central spot for visitors to experience the energy of Mardi Gras. The official colours of Mardi Gras—purple for justice, green for faith and gold for power—were set by Rex Krewe in 1872.

Over time, the lake transformed the landscape into something you'd think was straight out of a movie, as featured in today's image. The dam, originally known as the 'Cheow Lan Project,' was later renamed Rajjaprabha, meaning 'light of the kingdom,' a tribute to King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who ruled from 1946 to 2016.

Native to North America, these sheep are known for their distinctive curled horns, which can weigh up to 13 kilograms. Rams use their massive horns in intense head-butting contests. During these battles, males hurl themselves at each other in charges of up to 20 miles per hour. Ewes, on the other hand, tend to keep things more low-key, forming smaller groups with their lambs. Adapted to the desert environment, bighorn sheep can go long periods without water, relying on moisture from plants to survive.\nValley of Fire State Park, seen in today's image, is one of the best spots in Nevada to observe these desert dwellers. This park is named for its fiery red sandstone formations that seem to glow under the sun. Beyond its natural beauty, the park holds deep historical significance, with petroglyphs left by ancient Indigenous peoples. It has also earned a place in pop culture as a filming location for scenes from 'Star Trek Generations.' Keep an eye on the rocky outcrops during your visit—you might spot a bighorn sheep observing you.",

Rising 310 metres above England's capital, this glass-clad giant is not just the tallest building in the United Kingdom but also a symbol of modern London. It was designed by Renzo Piano, an Italian architect known for making a statement with high-tech, lightweight and functional designs. Inspired by church spires and ship masts, he envisioned a sleek, tapering structure that would reflect the changing sky. Construction began in 2009, and by 2012, it had officially claimed its title as Western Europe's tallest skyscraper.\nBuilt where Southwark Towers once stood, the Shard transformed the area into a hub of business, luxury and panoramic views. With 95 floors (though only 72 are habitable), the building houses offices, restaurants, the five-star Shangri-La Hotel and some of the priciest apartments in the city. Sustainability was also built into the design. The structure uses energy-efficient systems, including a combined heat and power plant, making it more than just a shimmering spectacle.",

The Royal Arms of England, dating back to the 12th century, feature three golden lions on a red background—a design still used today by English sporting bodies. You'll also find lion statues guarding Trafalgar Square, standing tall outside historic buildings, and even on British coins. Fossils show that cave lions once roamed prehistoric Britain, hunting large prey like deer and bison.

This fortress has seen it all—battles, power shifts and royal connections. Originally built in the 14th century, the medieval castle was designed to guard the Loire River and control access to the region. Over time, it evolved into a residence for nobility, most notably serving as the home of Maximilien de Béthune, Duke of Sully, who was a trusted minister of King Henry IV. The castle played a significant role during the French Wars of Religion from 1562 to 1598 and has witnessed countless moments of intrigue and diplomacy. In 1940, during World War II, the castle wall was hit by shells, creating massive holes, but the framework remained intact.\nToday, after multiple restorations, the castle welcomes visitors eager to uncover its history. It also stands as an example of French Renaissance architecture. Visitors can explore the imposing towers, thick stone walls and the beautiful moat that once protected the castle from invaders. The restored interiors feature authentic furniture and artefacts, offering a window into medieval life. Guided tours provide insights into the castle's role in shaping regional and national history. Beyond the stone walls, the surrounding park is an inviting space for explorers to unwind and take in the views of the Loire River.",

This date was chosen because 3, 1 and 4 are the first three significant figures of pi (π) when it is written out. Pi is an irrational number, which means that it can't be written as a fraction. When written out, its decimal representation goes on infinitely without repeating. The oldest attempts to calculate pi date back to ancient Babylon and Egypt, around 1,900 BCE.\nPi Day, however, has more recent origins. In the 1980s, physicist Larry Shaw organised the first celebration, where staff at a San Francisco science museum walked around in circles and then ate the number's delicious homophones: pies. Today's image takes us to Álava, northern Spain. The circular motion of the stars appears above the Dolmen of Sorginetxe, an ancient megalithic monument dating back to 3,000 BCE.

The term 'Ides' referred to the midpoint of the month in the Roman calendar, often marking the full moon. It was a time of celebration, with festivals and public gatherings. However, in 44 BCE, the Ides of March became synonymous with political upheaval, betrayal and an event that would trigger the fall of the Roman Republic. On that fateful day, Julius Caesar, Rome's powerful dictator, was assassinated by a group of senators. The conspirators, including his close ally Brutus, believed they were saving the Republic from Caesar's growing authority. Caesar was attacked near the Theatre of Pompey, but the tension of that moment echoed through the Roman Forum—the beating heart of Rome's political and social life.\nStrolling through the Forum, in present-day Italy, you can now see the remnants of history and the ruins of a once-mighty empire. Among its many treasures is the Temple of Saturn, pictured here. One of the Forum's oldest and most revered structures, it once guarded the Roman treasury, a stark symbol of the Republic Caesar's assassins claimed to protect.",

It's also commonly spotted in marshes, rice fields, seasonally flooded grasslands and along riverbanks. At first glance, this feathered genius seems like any other wading bird, with its long legs, slender neck and pointed beak that aid in hunting. But when it hunts, this jet-black African species showcases an extraordinary skill—it takes the shape of an umbrella, as seen in today's image.\nWhile fishing, the heron dips its head, extends its wings around its body and forms a shaded canopy. This clever technique is known as canopy feeding. One common theory is that small fish, seeking cover, are attracted to the shade of the heron's wings and swim right into its trap. The shade acts like polarised sunglasses, reducing glare and improving the heron's vision under the water. Additionally, the heron might also be camouflaging itself, which further intensifies the trap for the fish.",

The spring equinox occurs when the sun crosses the celestial equator, moving from the Southern Hemisphere to the Northern Hemisphere. Traditionally, spring is considered to begin on March 21. However, astronomers and calendar makers now agree that spring officially commences on March 20 across all time zones in North America. This event signals the true start of the season, bringing with it the beauty and symbolism of spring blooms.\nAmong these blooms, narcissus, commonly known as daffodil or jonquil—featured here—stands out as a quintessential symbol of the season. Celebrated for centuries in art and literature, the daffodil carries cultural significance worldwide, symbolising death, renewal and good fortune. As one of England's most cherished plants, the daffodil has been celebrated by many English writers for its cultural and symbolic significance, making it one of the most poetically revered flowers. From John Gower and Shakespeare to William Wordsworth and John Milton, daffodils have inspired countless verses in literary history.",

These gentle giants of the sea have been gliding through warm waters for millions of years, minding their own business and munching on seagrass. But despite their laid-back nature, they face serious threats. Hence, the last Wednesday of March is dedicated to them—Manatee Appreciation Day.\nThere are three species of manatees: the West Indian, the Amazonian and the African manatee. The West Indian manatee, which includes the Florida manatee, can grow up to 4 metres long and weigh over 450 kilograms. These peaceful creatures spend most of their time grazing and napping. They have no natural predators, but human activity poses a major risk. Boat strikes are a leading cause of injury and death, as these marine mammals are too slow to dodge speeding vessels. Habitat loss and pollution also threaten their survival. Conservation efforts, including speed limits in manatee zones and habitat protection, have helped, but these sea cows still need all the support they can get.",

Found across tropical southern Asia, from Iran and Sri Lanka to Indonesia and the Philippines, this feathered creature prefers dense forests and other lush, wooded spots. With short legs, it perches upright and spends most of its time catching insects in midair. These birds attach themselves to mixed-species of social gatherers and are often active in the dense understory of the forest canopy.\nDuring the breeding season, the female lays two to three eggs in a cosy, cup-shaped nest tucked into a tree fork, as seen in today's image. The nest is woven with filaments of webbing and the Marasmius, a type of mushroom-producing fungus, known for its natural antibiotic properties. This clever design may help shield the young birds from harmful infections, turning the nest into a tiny, self-sustaining sanctuary. And here's a touch—they even decorate it with spider-egg cases.",

		"description": "For one Sunday in March, the United Kingdom, Ireland and some Commonwealth countries take a break from the usual hustle to honour mums with flowers, cards and the occasional burnt toast in bed. Mothering Sunday isn't just Britain's version of Mother's Day—it has a history that predates the modern celebration by centuries. In medieval England, it was a religious occasion when people returned to their 'mother church'—the main church or cathedral in their area. This pilgrimage often led to family reunions, giving servants a rare day off to visit home. Naturally, a visit to mum was part of the tradition, and over time, the religious aspect blended with a more personal celebration.\nBy the early 20th century, Mothering Sunday had faded from popularity, overshadowed by industrialisation and changing social norms. But thanks to a campaign in the 1910s and 1920s by Constance Adelaide Smith, it made a comeback. Inspired by the American Mother's Day, she pushed for a revival, linking it to existing British traditions. By the mid-20th century, the day had regained its status as an annual event dedicated to mothers. Today, Mothering Sunday is a blend of old and new traditions. While church services still acknowledge their religious roots, the day is largely about showing appreciation for mums, grandmothers and mother figures. Whether it's a Sunday roast or just spending time together like these desert elephants in Namibia, however you choose to celebrate, make sure mom knows she's cherished.",

When the sun is positioned well below the horizon, during this brief window, the lingering sunlight casts a deep blue hue across the sky.\nNaxos is renowned for its deposits of emery, a corundum-rich rock that was once among the finest natural abrasives used before modern alternatives emerged. The most fertile island in the Cyclades, it has a reliable water supply in the region. It is celebrated across Greece for its signature flavours, including the rich Arseniko Naxou cheese, flavourful potatoes, aromatic Kitron liqueur made from local citrus and Naxian honey, primarily sourced from thyme nectar. A sun-soaked island, Naxos is packed with beaches, villages and ancient ruins. Whether you're looking to rest on the sands of beaches like Agia Anna, Agios Prokopios or Plaka, or chase the wind at one of the island's top windsurfing and kitesurfing spots, there's no shortage of adventure here.",

		"description": "From the famous tulip fields to the world's largest flower auction, the Netherlands and tulips go a long way back. Interestingly, tulips didn't originate here. These beauties arrived in the country in the late 16th century, brought from the Ottoman Empire. By the 17th century, they became so valuable that a single bulb could cost more than a house. This period, known as 'tulip mania,' is considered one of the first recorded financial bubbles. When prices crashed in 1637, fortunes were lost, but the love for tulips remained.\nThe most famous tulip fields, like the one pictured here, are found in regions such as the Bollenstreek (Bulb Region), just outside Amsterdam. Rows of red, yellow, pink and purple stretch as far as the eye can see. Then there's Keukenhof, in Lisse, the world's most famous flower park, open only for a few weeks each spring. It showcases over seven million bulbs, including rare and exotic tulip varieties. The designs change every year, so no two visits are ever the same. If you miss the bloom, don't worry—the Netherlands keeps its tulip industry thriving year-round. The Dutch take their tulips seriously, and nowhere is this more evident than at the Aalsmeer Flower Auction, the largest flower market in the world. Here, millions of flowers, including tulips, are bought and sold daily, making their way to homes across the globe.",

Then, on April 12, 1961, one man left the planet and changed history forever. That morning, Soviet pilot Yuri Gagarin climbed into a small, spherical spacecraft named Vostok 1. The countdown began. The engines ignited. As the rocket roared toward the sky, he called out, 'Poyekhali!'—'Let's go!' And just like that, Earth had its first space traveller.\nFor 108 minutes, Gagarin orbited the planet, watching the world from a view no human had ever seen before. When he landed safely back on Earth, everything had changed. Humanity had entered the Space Age. His flight sparked the race to the Moon, the dream of living on Mars and much more. Decades later, in honour of his achievement, the United Nations declared April 12 as the International Day of Human Space Flight. Pictured here is the view from the cupola of the International Space Station, showing the vast South Pacific Ocean. It is a reminder of how small Earth is in the grand cosmos—and how far human spaceflight has taken us.",

Thailand's Songkran festival is a unique mix of spiritual traditions and all-out water fights. Held from April 13 to 15 this year, the holiday is deeply rooted in Buddhist customs and focuses on cleansing and starting afresh. During this time, people visit temples, offer food to monks and pour scented water over Buddha statues and elders' hands as a sign of respect. Meanwhile, the streets turn into water battlegrounds, with locals and tourists alike getting soaked in the spirit of renewal. Traditional parades roll through the lanes, and in some places, the 'Lady Songkran' or 'Miss Songkran' contest steals the show, with contestants dressed in stunning Thai outfits.\nThose seeking a calmer way to celebrate might consider visiting Wat Tang Sai Temple in Ban Krut, seen in today's image. Perched on Thong Chai Mountain, this temple complex is home to a 13-metre-tall Buddha statue and Thai-style pagodas. Built in 1996 to honour King Bhumibol Adulyadej (Rama IX) on his 50th year of reign (1946–2016), it remains an important spiritual site.

		"description": "Within the remote canyons of southeastern Utah, United States, Natural Bridges National Monument highlights the power of erosion and the passage of time. Shaped by the relentless forces of wind and water, this monument features three magnificent natural bridges—Sipapu, Kachina and Owachomo. These bridges were named to honour the Ancestral Puebloans who once lived here. Sipapu is the largest bridge, with a massive opening that could almost fit the dome of the United States Capitol. Kachina, pictured here, is equidistant from Sipapu and Owachomo. It was named after the petroglyphs and pictographs found at its base. Owachomo is believed to be the oldest of the three. Its thin, arching structure suggests it may eventually collapse.\nRecognising the significance of these natural wonders, United States President Theodore Roosevelt designated Natural Bridges as Utah's first national monument in 1908. Today, it remains a place of awe and solitude, where visitors can hike beneath the soaring bridges, gaze at some of the darkest night skies in the country and step back into a landscape sculpted over millions of years.",

They look like they're wearing a bright orange-red costume, complete with a huge crest that almost covers their beak. With its bold colours, this native South American bird isn't just about looks—it's got the moves too.\nThe Andean and Guianan cock-of-the-rock are renowned for their theatrical courtship dances, making them true head-turners of the feathered kingdom. Females are far less flashy, with brownish feathers that help them stay hidden. During the mating season, males gather in leks—noisy display arenas—where they hop, squawk and shake their heads in an effort to impress a female. She watches, picks the best dancer, mates and then flies off to build a concave, cup-shaped mud nest on a rocky surface. The female typically lays two white eggs and incubates them for 25 to 28 days, raising the chicks on her own. The Andean cock-of-the-rock thrives in the cloud forests of the Andes, favouring dense, fruit-rich areas in Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia. As a frugivore, it primarily eats fruit and helps spread seeds throughout its habitat. It occasionally consumes insects and small vertebrates.",

That's why April 18 is the International Day for Monuments and Sites, an event recognised by UNESCO dedicated to protecting cultural treasures worldwide. This day is all about celebrating our history, raising awareness about endangered sites and making sure future generations can enjoy them too. A remarkable example is Göreme Historical National Park in Cappadocia, Türkiye. It's famous for its 'fairy chimneys'—towering rock formations shaped by volcanic ash and erosion over thousands of years. People even carved homes, churches and entire underground cities into these soft rock formations, some dating back to the 4th century. Today, it's a UNESCO World Heritage Site, attracting visitors from around the world.\nThe United Kingdom and its British Overseas Territories are home to 35 UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Among these, one site—the Frontiers of the Roman Empire—is shared between England and Scotland. It encompasses three significant defensive walls spread across Europe. These fortifications—Hadrian's Wall, the Antonine Wall and Limes Germanicus. At its peak in the 2nd century AD, the Roman Limes marked the empire's vast expanse, stretching over 5,000 kilometres. Hadrian's Wall in the UK, spanning 118 kilometres, was erected around AD 122 on the command of Emperor Hadrian to define the northernmost border of Roman Britannia. Further north, the Antonine Wall in Scotland, measuring 60 kilometres, was constructed in AD 142 under Emperor Antoninus Pius to fortify Roman defences against northern tribes.",

This widely celebrated feast honors Saint George, the soldier-saint and dragon slayer, and is observed on April 23—the date traditionally associated with his martyrdom. Saint George rose to prominence in England during the Crusades and the Hundred Years' War, eventually becoming the nation's patron saint in the Tudor period. However, enthusiasm for his feast day declined after the union of England and Scotland in the 18th century. Recognition of Saint George as England's patron saint and the celebration of his day has resurged since the mid-1990s. This revival builds on efforts that began with the Royal Society of St. George in 1894. Since the early 2010s, these initiatives have gained momentum, leading to festivities that increasingly resemble a national holiday in England.\nPictured here is a towering mechanical dragon from the day's weekend celebrations. This is connected to the legend of Saint George defeating a fearsome dragon. According to the story, a village was terrified by a dragon demanding tribute. When the local princess was chosen as the next sacrifice, Saint George encountered her on her way to the beast's lair. Despite her warnings to flee, he bravely faced the dragon, vanquished it and saved the day.",

The London Marathon is one of the world's seven major marathons, known for its fast course and huge crowds. British distance legend Paula Radcliffe set the women's world record here in 2003, clocking 2:15:25—a time that remained unbeaten for 16 years. This year, the demand is unreal—840,000+ hopefuls entered the ballot. That's a record-smashing number, with 49% of UK applicants being women and a significant rise in young runners.\nThe route captures the essence of the city, covering 26.2 miles of historic streets lined with electric crowds. Runners start in Greenwich, push through Canary Wharf and race past the Tower of London before the final stretch along the Thames. The halfway point at Tower Bridge, featured in today's image, isn't just a landmark—it's where legs grow heavy, but the cheers grow louder. Whether you're running, cheering or watching from home, this day marks another milestone in this legendary event.",

		"description": "Here's a place where the wild rules and nature moves at its own pace. Moremi Game Reserve stretches across the eastern side of Botswana's Okavango Delta, covering 1,900 square miles. Established in 1963, it became Africa's first reserve created by local people—the Batawana, a Bantu ethnic group native to Southern Africa—to protect the region's wildlife from uncontrolled hunting. The combination of permanent water and dry land makes it one of the best places in Africa to observe wildlife in its natural habitat.\nOne animal you're almost certain to spot is the impala. These medium-sized antelopes are active mainly during the day. Males fight fiercely for dominance during the breeding season, or rut, locking horns in dramatic battles. After a six-month gestation period, females give birth to a single fawn. Outside the mating season, they stick together in herds—the territorial males, bachelor herds and female herds—always on the lookout for predators. When danger strikes, they freeze, only to explode into a sprint when the moment demands. They can leap up to 3 metres high, cover nearly 9 metres in a single bound, and change direction mid-sprint. Whether grazing quietly or launching into a sudden dash, impalas are among Moremi's most adaptable residents.",

		"description": "The grass truly is greener on the other side—especially when that side is Château de Villandry. While the Loire Valley in France is packed with stunning châteaux (French for castles), Villandry stands apart, not for its towering turrets or medieval might, but for its gardens. Built in the 16th century by Jean le Breton, a minister to King Francis I, Villandry was always meant to impress. Unlike fortified castles built for war, it was designed for comfort, featuring large windows and an open, welcoming layout. Its gardens are arranged across terraces with distinct themes. The ornamental garden showcases geometric patterns like the one pictured here. The water garden offers a serene retreat, and the vegetable garden turns everyday crops into artistic displays.\nAfter a challenging period, the dilapidated Château de Villandry was purchased in 1906 by Spanish doctor Joachim Carvallo and his wife, Ann Coleman, an heiress to an American steel empire. Their passion for history and horticulture led to a full restoration, and their descendants continue to maintain the estate today. These gardens change with the seasons, ensuring that no two visits are exactly alike. Whether you have a green thumb or not, it's hard not to admire the precision at play.",

From the smoky clubs of London to the bustling streets of Tokyo, jazz has crossed borders, blended cultures and turned improvisation into an art form. Every April 30, International Jazz Day—established by UNESCO in 2011—celebrates this genre's role in promoting peace, dialogue and unity. This music form emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in New Orleans, a city alive with musical traditions from Africa, Europe and the Caribbean. Rooted in blues and ragtime, jazz quickly evolved, with pioneers like Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald giving it a voice. In the United Kingdom, jazz flourished in the 1940s, with London's Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club, founded in 1959, becoming a legendary venue. British jazz icons like Tubby Hayes and Courtney Pine pushed the genre forward, while the EFG London Jazz Festival remains a major event, drawing international stars and local talent alike.\nToday, jazz is everywhere—from Brazilian bossa nova to Ethiopian Ethio-jazz, proving that a good groove knows no borders.

		"description": "Today, while the world celebrates May Day with parades and protests, Hawaii takes a more fragrant approach—by draping itself in flowers. On May 1, Hawaii, United States, celebrates Lei Day, a tradition that honours culture, craftsmanship and the ever-present aloha spirit, described as 'the coordination of mind and heart within each person.' Since 1928, this Hawaiian tradition has been in full bloom, with leis—or garlands made of flowers, leaves or shells—serving as symbols of connection. The idea for Lei Day came from poet Don Blanding, who suggested a holiday dedicated to Hawaii's iconic floral garlands. Local writer Grace Tower Warren gave it its slogan, 'May Day is Lei Day in Hawaii,' and the tradition quickly took root.\nWhat started as a single event in Honolulu has grown into a statewide celebration, with each island showcasing its unique floral identity, such as Maui's pink lokelani rose and the Big Island's red 'ōhi'a lehua. Giving a lei is a gesture of aloha, and on this day, that warmth can be seen everywhere. Whether crafted from fragrant Plumeria flowers, like the ones pictured here, delicate pikake, or colourful ti leaves, leis symbolise the bonds between people and the land. So, if you find yourself in Hawaii on May 1, don't just say 'Aloha'—wear it.",

The beach stays put, but the city transforms into a giant stage during the Brighton Festival—a three-week celebration where art spills out of theatres, dances down alleyways and occasionally juggles fire on the seafront. Started in 1967, the Brighton Festival has grown into one of England's largest curated multi-arts festivals. This year, the fest is taking place from 3 to 26 May in venues across Brighton, Hove and Sussex, featuring 120 events, exhibitions and installations. Each year, the event hands the creative reins to a guest director, often an artist with something fresh to say. From authors to musicians to activists, these directors shape the theme and vibe of the festival. Grammy-nominated, genre-defying musician, composer, and activist Anoushka Shankar was inspired by the theme of 'New Dawn' for this year's programme.\nWhile the official lineup features big-name artists, international performers and experimental gems, its unofficial sibling, the Brighton Fringe (May 2 - June 1, 2025), makes room for the wonderfully weird and wildly independent.

Below, the world's oldest desert, the Namib, stretches endlessly, shaped by winds over 55 million years. This is Namibia—a surreal landscape of towering dunes, dry riverbeds and shifting sands.\nUnlike traditional aircraft, ultralights offer an unmatched sense of freedom. Also known as microlights, these small planes are designed for low-altitude, slow-speed flying. Their weight and speed limits vary by country; in the United Kingdom, they must not exceed a maximum take-off weight of 600 kilograms for landplanes and 650 kilograms for seaplanes. The stall speed (minimum speed at which the aircraft can remain in controlled flight) must not exceed 45 knots (approximately 52 miles per hour). With open or semi-enclosed cockpits, ultralights provide breathtaking panoramic views, making each flight an immersive experience. Ultralight aviation emerged in the late 1970s and early 1980s, revolutionising recreational flying. With minimal regulations and lightweight design, these aircraft offer an accessible and exhilarating way to explore some of the world's most remote and beautiful places, like the one we see in today's image.",

Built in the 13th century, this castle in County Antrim, Northern Ireland, was once a stronghold of the MacDonnells of Antrim, a branch of the Clan MacDonnell that played a key role in Irish politics from the 15th to the 17th century. The family's fortunes declined after the Battle of the Boyne in 1690, and with little money for upkeep, the castle gradually fell into ruin.\nDunluce Castle is steeped in legend, including the tale of its banshee. Maeve Roe, the only daughter of Lord MacQuillan, defied an arranged marriage and was locked away in the castle's turret. One night, as Maeve Roe and her lover fled by boat, a fierce storm struck, dragging them both to a watery grave. Locals say her ghostly cries still echo from the turret. Today, visitors can explore the windswept remains of this medieval fortress, imagining the feasts and battles that once took place here. And if the castle itself isn't impressive enough, the views over the Causeway Coast certainly are.",

World Donkey Day, established by Dr. Abdul Raziq Kakar, a livestock expert from Pakistan, is all about celebrating these hardworking animals. Donkeys have a reputation for being stubborn, but that's just a misunderstanding. They're actually cautious thinkers. Unlike horses, which might bolt at danger, donkeys take a moment to assess the situation before reacting. From ancient trade routes to modern farms, donkeys have been essential to transportation and agriculture. In many parts of the world, they're still the backbone of rural economies, carrying supplies across difficult terrain where vehicles can't go. Despite their vital role, donkeys face serious challenges. Many endure overwork, poor treatment and abandonment.\nSpanish explorers introduced donkeys, or burros, to North America in the 1500s. Today is a great excuse to visit Beatty, Nevada, where these mammals roam freely and interact with the townsfolk. While you're there, don't miss the Rhyolite ghost town, a relic of the gold rush era.

Originally called Grey Lake National Tourism Park, it was renamed in 1970 and later designated a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in 1978. Its most recognisable feature—the three massive granite peaks known as the Torres—stands over 2,500 metres tall. These formations took shape through magma intrusion and uplift, followed by millions of years of glacial erosion, leaving behind the jagged spires seen today.\nThe park's lakes and rivers, fuelled by melting ice, create a hydrological network that sustains its wildlife. Four major glaciers—Tyndall, Grey, Dickson and Zapata—are fed by the Southern Patagonian Ice Field. Originating from Dickson Lake, the Paine River flows through various bodies of water, including Paine Lake, Nordenskjöld Lake and Pehoé Lake. Wildlife thrives here, including pumas, endangered southern huemuls (south Andean deer), Chilean flamingos and chimango caracaras.

		"description": "Most ports rely on docks and cranes that extend into the shoreline. Porto Flavia in the Sulcis-Iglesiente region, however, took a completely different approach. This engineering marvel transformed a cliff into a gateway for Sardinia's ore industry. Mining in Sulcis-Iglesiente has a history dating back thousands of years, from the Phoenicians and Romans to the industrial boom in the 20th century. Lead, zinc, coal, sulphur, barium and silver were extracted from these rugged hills but transporting them was a logistical nightmare. Ore had to be hauled by cart, loaded onto small boats and then transferred to larger ships—a slow, costly and inefficient process.\nIn 1924, Italian engineer Cesare Vecelli revolutionised ore transport in the region. He designed Porto Flavia as a system of tunnels and silos carved into a limestone cliff, allowing ore to be loaded directly onto cargo ships. The facility featured two stacked tunnel levels. The upper level could store up to 11,000 short tons of ore in nine reservoirs. Gravity-fed chutes transported the ore to the lower level, where a conveyor belt loaded it directly onto waiting ships. The port, named after Vecelli's daughter, Flavia, remained in use until mining declined in the mid-20th century. Today, visitors can explore its tunnels, massive silos and the platform where ships once docked—soaking in the same sea breeze that once carried Sardinia's minerals to markets worldwide.",

At 96 metres tall, the tower is part of the grand Palace of Westminster, home to the UK Parliament.\nFor centuries, the Palace of Westminster has stood at the heart of British politics. Originally built by Edward the Confessor in the 11th century, the palace has hosted Parliament since the 13th century. Previously a royal residence, it remained one until a fire in 1512 forced Henry VIII to relocate. A second devastating fire in 1834 destroyed most of the medieval complex, leading to the Gothic Revival design seen today. Architect Charles Barry led the reconstruction, while his assistant, Augustus Pugin, designed the intricate details. Covering 112,476 square metres, the palace houses the House of Commons, the House of Lords and Westminster Hall, which dates to 1097.",

First launched in 2006 by the Endangered Species Coalition and conservationist David Robinson, this event inspires local and global efforts to protect threatened animals and their habitats.\nThe stunning bird, featured in today's image, is the great green macaw. Native to the tropical forests of Central and South America, this colourful parrot is critically endangered, with fewer than 1,000 individuals estimated in the wild. These intelligent, social birds depend heavily on old-growth forests, particularly in places like Costa Rica, where they nest in almendro trees. Deforestation and habitat fragmentation remain their greatest threats. On May 16, let's join wildlife refuges, schools and conservation groups in celebrating and supporting biodiversity. Every voice counts in protecting species that still have a fighting chance.",

Spanning over 212 square miles, this lagoon is a rich mosaic of islands, mudflats, canals and marshes, and it's one of the largest wetlands in the entire Mediterranean Basin. The lagoon isn't just a scenic wonder—it's a place steeped in history and innovation. Formed after the last Ice Age, it became a refuge for people fleeing invasions around the time of the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 CE. In the centuries that followed, those early settlers began building what would eventually become the iconic city of Venice.\nToday, the lagoon is still central to local life, supporting fishing, tourism and even sustainable aquaculture. It's connected to the Adriatic Sea by three inlets and is famous for 'acqua alta,' or 'high water,' when tides flood parts of Venice. From ancient refuge to modern marvel, the Venetian Lagoon is a reflection of how people and nature can shape a place together.",

The 'La Fée Electricité' (The Spirit of Electricity) is housed at the Museum of Modern Art in Paris. This stunning artwork was created for the Pavilion of Light and Electricity at the 1937 International Exhibition of Art and Technology in Modern Life. The painting was inspired by the poem 'On the Nature of Things,' written by Roman poet and philosopher Lucretius. Raoul Dufy's work vividly depicts the evolution of electricity through two main themes: the history of electricity and its applications.\nInternational Museum Day, celebrated annually on May 18, aims to raise awareness about the importance of museums in cultural exchange, enrichment and mutual understanding. Since its inception in 1977, the event has grown to include over 37,000 museums across 158 countries.

		"description": "Honey bees may be small, but without them, your grocery list would be a lot shorter. No more berries, avocados or even coffee. Alongside butterflies, bats and hummingbirds, bees pollinate nearly 90% of the world's wild flowering plants and over 35% of the food crops we rely on. World Bee Day, marked every May 20, honours these vital pollinators and celebrates Anton Janša, a pioneer of modern beekeeping. Janša saw bees as the noblest of insects, an idea now backed by science.\nUnfortunately, bee populations are in danger. Pesticide exposure, habitat loss and climate change are driving their numbers down, threatening both global food security and biodiversity. The good news is that small actions can make a big difference. Support local beekeepers, plant pollinator-friendly flowers and avoid chemical pesticides. And the next time you stir honey into your tea, remember the tiny worker behind that golden spoonful and why protecting this buzzing species matters more than ever.",

From the misty hills of Zhejiang province in China, pictured here, to the rolling estates of Assam in India, the process differs. Green tea leaves are sun-dried or steamed to preserve their freshness, while oolong and black teas undergo oxidation to develop complex, bold flavours. The result is a rich spectrum of taste, colour and aroma. China, India, Kenya and Sri Lanka lead global tea production. Each country offers its own signature style: China with pu-erh and green teas, India with robust black blends, Kenya with CTC teas and Sri Lanka with floral Ceylon.

All tortoises are turtles, but not all turtles are tortoises. While turtles are smaller and built for swimming, tortoises are larger, heavier and adapted for life on land. The American Tortoise Rescue (ATR) established World Turtle Day to raise awareness and protection efforts on May 23 each year. ATR has helped rehabilitate, rescue and rehome around 4,000 turtles and tortoises, working to protect them and their disappearing habitats.\nHere we see a fascinating Amazonian phenomenon—a Julia butterfly on the nose of a yellow-spotted river turtle in Ecuador's Amazon River region. Butterflies in the Amazon are known to sip the tears of turtles, which provide a vital source of sodium, a mineral in short supply. The yellow-spotted river turtle is one of the largest river turtles in South America. While these turtles are well-adapted to the waters, they face a range of threats from humans, birds, snakes, large fish, frogs and mammals. In the 1960s, they were heavily exploited for the American pet trade, leading to strict regulations on their importation. Today, a captive, self-sustaining population exists in the United States, with some living over 30 years in captivity.",

Created by the EUROPARC Federation in 1999, this day commemorates the founding of Europe's first national parks—a set of nine parks established in Sweden in 1909. It promotes efforts to protect natural habitats, wildlife and cultural heritage while encouraging sustainable tourism and outdoor activities.\nJotunheimen National Park in Norway is a prime example of protected natural landscapes. Established in 1980, it covers over 400 square miles of mountains, glaciers and deep valleys. It is home to the country's highest peaks, including Galdhøpiggen, the highest in Northern Europe at 2,469 metres. The name 'Jotunheimen' translates to 'Home of the Giants,' a nod to its dramatic terrain and Norse mythology. The park shelters red foxes, Arctic foxes, lemmings and red deer, while its flora includes hardy alpine species adapted to extreme conditions. Flowing through the park, the Gjende lake is famous for its striking green colour, caused by glacial sediments. Stretching about 11 miles in length and less than a mile at its widest point, the lake sits at around 1,000 metres above sea level. It's the launch point for the famous Besseggen hike—which attracts thousands each year—made famous by Henrik Ibsen's play 'Peer Gynt.'",

These majestic giants are often referred to as the 'upside-down trees' because of their unusual appearance, with their wide, thick trunks resembling roots reaching for the sky. Native to Africa, Madagascar and parts of Australia, baobabs have earned their nickname due to their quirky silhouette, but there's much more to them than meets the eye.\nToday's image features Madagascar's Avenue of the Baobabs. In the Menabe region of western Madagascar, Grandidier's baobabs line the unpaved Road No. 8. Also known as giant baobabs, they are the largest and most famous of Madagascar's baobab species. Locally known as renala or reniala ('mother of the forest'), these trees are remnants of the lush tropical forests that once covered this island country. Now, they stand alone as survivors of widespread deforestation.

But it doesn't have to be that way. On World Otter Day—the last Wednesday of May—let's shine a light on the challenges these lovable mammals face and help protect their place in the wild.\nOtters belong to the Mustelidae family, a diverse group that includes weasels, badgers and minks, and are found on every continent except Australia and Antarctica. With 13 species worldwide, including the European otter, giant otter and sea otter—pictured here—these semi-aquatic animals are adapted for life in water. Their webbed feet, dense fur and strong tails make them excellent swimmers. Beyond their cuteness, otters play a vital role in ecosystems. As top predators in freshwater and coastal habitats, they help maintain healthy fish populations and keep aquatic environments balanced. Without otters, food chains could become unstable, leading to ecological problems. Whether it's through education, conservation efforts or simply spreading the word, every action helps keep them afloat. So, let's paddle together.",

Built by the Moors and later fortified by the French military order Knights Templar, this fortress was made to last. Thick walls, strategic towers and a commanding view of the river made sure of that.

Towns like Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge grew up with it. Even the river's name is a nod to the past—the passenger pigeon, once common in the area, vanished by the early 1900s.\nThe West, Middle and East prongs come together to form a system that cuts through the Smokies and flows into the Pigeon River. Trails like the Gatlinburg Trail run alongside the river, offering flat paths with water views and shady rest spots. Some hikes, like the Ramsey Cascades trail, follow the river deeper into the park and reward you with impressive waterfalls.

Something as simple as cycling can significantly boost your health, and swapping the car for a bicycle is an easy way to stay active. Moreover, cycling helps reduce pollution, eases traffic congestion and offers an affordable transport option for those without access to cars. Because of all these benefits, the United Nations dedicated June 3 as World Bicycle Day—a day to celebrate everything this amazing two-wheeler stands for.\nIf there's one place that brings the cycling spirit to life, it's the Netherlands. Today's image captures bicycles lined up on a bridge in Utrecht. More than half the journeys around the city happen on bikes, surpassing cars and other transport options. Nearly everyone lives within 15 minutes of essentials—and over 90% can reach key places in just 10. This wasn't always the case. It was only in the 1970s, sparked by an oil crisis, rising car-related issues and strong social movements, that the country started prioritising bikes over cars. Since then, cities have embraced bike-friendly streets, dedicated lanes and traffic lights for cyclists. And thanks to the famously flat landscape, cycling here feels as natural as walking.",

		"description": "The island of Sardinia in Italy, with its rugged cliffs, secret beaches and endless shades of blue, is undeniably a Mediterranean treasure. This island has a coastline that stretches over 1,100 miles. While natural rivers are few, with Tirso being the longest, Sardinia has embraced innovation with 54 artificial lakes and dams. Among the most significant are Lake Omodeo and Lake Coghinas, key sources of water and electricity for the region.\nOn the island's eastern coast lies Cala Luna, featured here—a beach in the Gulf of Orosei. Rising at the mouth of Rio Illune, this beach is at the end of the Codula di Luna canyon. It is a haven of golden sand, surrounded by white cliffs that rise around 300 metres into the sky—perfect for rock climbing. Here, the waters are shallow at first, before deepening into crystal-clear depths ideal for snorkeling, diving and fishing. In the local Nuoro dialect, the word for 'Luna,' meaning 'moon', is rendered as 'elune,' a name that perfectly captures the essence of this enchanting cove. Adding to the mystique, the beach's crescent shape echoes its lunar inspiration. For centuries, shepherds from the village of Baunei would embark on an eight-hour walk to reach this secluded spot, considering it a journey as far as the moon itself.",

Plastic contamination has crept into every part of the world—from oceans and forests to our own bodies in the form of microplastics. This year's campaign aims to spark change at every level of society.\nAnd that brings us to today's image, a mural that's turning heads and making a difference in Guatire, Venezuela. A local artist, Oscar Olivares, created one of the world's largest eco-murals—made entirely from plastic bottle caps. The 385-square-metre artwork is made of 400,000 bottle caps and depicts two blue macaws spreading their wings across a once-plain cement wall. Children, seniors and everyone in between rolled up their sleeves to glue caps, piece by piece, converting waste into something meaningful. Through this project, Olivares not only crafted something beautiful, but also sparked conversations about sustainability and showed people the power of collective action. Because sometimes, a big change starts with something as small as a bottle cap.",

On June 6, 1944, over 156,000 Allied troops landed on the beaches of Normandy, France, launching Operation Overlord, also known as D-Day. This complex assault, involving coordinated air, sea and land forces, marked the beginning of the campaign to liberate Western Europe from Nazi control.\nOne of the key sites was Arromanches-les-Bains, pictured here. Though not among the initial landing beaches, this quiet coastal town became vital in the days that followed. It was here that the Allies built Mulberry harbour B, a massive, temporary port assembled in record time to offload troops, vehicles and supplies. In the months after D-Day, more than 2.5 million men and 500,000 vehicles landed at Arromanches. Remnants of the harbour still lie offshore, a symbol of the ingenuity and planning behind the operation. Arromanches is also home to the Musée du Débarquement, the first museum dedicated to D-Day and the Battle of Normandy, a place where history lives on through stories of courage and resilience.",

This street was built between 1829 and 1834 as part of a plan to modernise the city and improve access to Grassmarket from George IV Bridge. The architect, Thomas Hamilton, took one look at the steep hill and decided to lean into it—literally—designing a graceful curve that follows the natural contour of the land. He even added a terrace of arched shops on the upper level, creating a sort of two-tiered retail sandwich.\nIndependent shops rule here. Everything from artisan cheese and handmade fudge to tweed jackets and tarot cards can be found here. There's also The Red Door Gallery for local art lovers and Museum Context—a must for fans of a certain boy wizard. Victoria Street is often said to have inspired Diagon Alley from the 'Harry Potter' series, though this connection has never been officially confirmed. Up above, the curve continues with the upper terrace, known as West Bow. Once the site of public executions, Grassmarket is now home to cafés and stores with less grim reputations. The layering of shops above and below gives Victoria Street its unique visual punch. And if you're lucky, you might catch one of the city's talented buskers adding a soundtrack to your stroll. So, just be careful—you might fall head over heels. And not just because it's steep.",

This year's theme is 'WONDER: Sustaining What Sustains Us.' It highlights how the ocean supports life as we know it—influencing weather, food chains and economies.\nOff the coast of Vancouver Island in Canada, Steller sea lions glide through chilly waters, as seen in today's image. These marine mammals are heavy—females average 580 pounds, while males are around 1,200 pounds. Males are noticeably larger than females and are known for their loud roars, thick necks and flatter snouts. Their deep vocalisations include belching, growling and snorting to warn others and communicate underwater. Males get loud to defend turf, while moms and pups use unique calls to find each other in a crowded rookery. Despite their size, they're preyed on by orcas and large sharks. These sea lions are considered near-threatened, with populations declining in parts of Alaska. Ocean conservation keeps them—and countless other mammals—afloat.",

		"description": "There is something mesmerising about cities that wear their history on their sleeves—and Dubrovnik, Croatia, is one of them. Once known as the independent Republic of Ragusa, this city was a major maritime power and trading hub from the 14th to the 19th century. Situated in southern Dalmatia along the Adriatic Sea, its success was built on diplomacy and seafaring. The Walls of Dubrovnik, built between the 13th and 17th centuries, stretch for over 1.2 miles, with towers, forts and bastions still standing strong. The current layout of the walls follows a city plan from 1292, when Dubrovnik was rebuilt after a fire under Venetian rule.\nInside these walls is the Old City—a compact grid of polished limestone streets, baroque churches and centuries-old residences. Everything here, including the 15th-century Rector's Palace, Sponza Palace and the Church of St Blaise, reflects the city's independent past. The Franciscan Monastery, Europe's oldest still operating pharmacy, adds another layer of charm to this vintage place. Dubrovnik might seem familiar. That's because it has represented the cities of King's Landing and Qarth in 'Game of Thrones,' putting it on the pop culture map. It's not just a touristy location—it's a city that has been writing its own script for over a thousand years.",

Everglades National Park, located in Florida, is the largest tropical wilderness in the United States, spanning more than 1.5 million acres (607,000 hectares). It protects the southern 20% of the original Everglades and is home to numerous rare and endangered species, including the Florida panther, American crocodile and West Indian manatee. Often referred to as 'River of Grass,' the park's unique ecosystem, fed by a slow-moving river from Lake Okeechobee to Florida Bay, is a significant breeding ground for tropical wading birds. Everglades National Park is not only a national treasure but also an international one, recognised as a World Heritage Site, an International Biosphere Reserve, and a Wetland of International Importance.\nThe park also plays a crucial role in water conservation and flood control, as its wetlands serve as natural filters and buffers against storms. Efforts to preserve and restore the Everglades are ongoing, with numerous initiatives aimed at combating invasive species, improving water quality and protecting wildlife habitats.",

Towering up to 150 centimetres tall with spoon-shaped bills and stilt-like legs, they're easy to spot.\nThat bubblegum pink hue? That's all diet. Flamingos feed on algae, crustaceans and tiny invertebrates packed with carotenoids—the same pigments that make carrots orange. The more they eat, the pinker they get. In other words, they're what they eat, right down to the blush. In the air, flamingos are sleek flyers, cruising long distances in a V-formation.

The 801,163-acre (324,219-hectare) area, originally part of Mexico, became a part of the United States in 1848. Efforts to preserve its beauty began in the 1930s, culminating in its official designation as a park on June 12, 1944. Big Bend remains one of the most remote and least-visited national parks in the country. It's not just one landscape, it's three: the Chihuahuan Desert, the Chisos Mountains (pictured here) and the Rio Grande. Big Bend sits on the United States–Mexico border, and its history reflects that blend. Indigenous peoples, Spanish explorers, ranchers, miners and modern travellers have all left their footprints. Petroglyphs, ruins and old trails show the land's story began long before it became a park.\nThe park is home to over 1,200 species of plants, more than 450 species of birds and a wide variety of mammals, reptiles and amphibians. You might spot a roadrunner zipping across the dirt or a bobcat silently slipping through the underbrush. Additionally, it has been designated as one of the best dark-sky parks in America, offering views of the Milky Way, planets and constellations.",

This uninhabited green islet sits quietly just south of the town of Vila Franca do Campo. Beneath its serene surface, this gem holds a lively past. First documented in 1537, around the time when settlers from São Miguel began expanding westward, Vila Franca Islet has played many roles throughout its history. It has served as a military fort, a port, a vineyard site and even a lookout for whale-watching.\nOnce a volcanic crater, this islet is now a protected nature reserve teeming with unique marine life, including bird species like Bulwer's petrel, little egret and sooty tern. The unique shape of this tiny island, sculpted by nature, makes it truly special. At its heart lies an almost perfectly circular lagoon, linked to the sea by a narrow channel called Boquete. Since the opening faces north toward São Miguel, it shields the lagoon from ocean waves and forms a calm natural harbour with a sandy beach. It's no wonder the spot is a favourite for swimmers: from June to October, ferries run daily between the town and the islet. Access is limited to 400 visitors a day—do you want to be one of them?",

Trooping the Colour is a centuries-old military tradition, held each June to mark the official birthday of the reigning monarch—even if their actual birthday is in, say, November. The real reason? The weather's better. No one wants to troop anything through puddles. There's marching, music, horses, salutes—and a good chance of spotting a royal in a bearskin or bonnet.\nThe name comes from 'trooping' (carrying) regimental flags—or 'colours'—through the ranks. It's all about honouring both the King and the regiments who serve him. Over 1,400 soldiers, 200 horses and 300 musicians take over Horse Guards Parade in London, showcasing the British Army at its best. The King inspects the troops; the Royal Family appears on horseback or in carriages and the RAF crowns the occasion with a spectacular flypast over Buckingham Palace.

In 1907, Grace Clayton, who lost her father in the Monongah mining disaster in West Virginia, United States, suggested a service to honour fathers who died in the incident. Although the idea didn't gain traction initially, it was revived in 1909 by Sonora Smart Dodd of Spokane, Washington, United States. She sought to pay tribute to her father, an American Civil War veteran who raised six children alone. Her determination sparked a movement, laying the foundation for the day we now dedicate to dads.\nIn the spirit of Father's Day, featured here is a lesser male rhea, also known as Darwin's rhea, with his chicks in the Torres del Paine National Park, Patagonia, Chile. A male lesser rhea mates with several females and leads them to a shared nest, where they lay eggs in succession before leaving and returning periodically to add more. From the moment his chicks hatch, the male lesser rhea takes full charge—guiding them through the brush, communicating with gentle whistles and sheltering them under his wings in times of danger or cold. Remarkably, he often adopts lost chicks, raising a mixed-age brood. For nearly six months, he teaches and protects them, with many staying close until maturity. Talk about going above and beyond for your kids!",

Today, World Sea Turtle Day, is about recognising these ancient navigators and the role they play in keeping our oceans in balance. Why June 16? The date marks the birthday of American conservationist Archie Carr, known as the 'father of sea turtle conservation.' His work laid the foundation for understanding turtle behaviour and fighting for their protection.\nThere are seven species of sea turtles gliding through the world's oceans: green, loggerhead, hawksbill, leatherback, Kemp's ridley, olive ridley and flatback. Most of them are either endangered or vulnerable. These creatures often mistake floating plastic for jellyfish and eat it; fishing nets unintentionally trap and drown them; and rising temperatures are making most hatchlings female, which has a negative impact on biodiversity. So today, lend a hand to a turtle—or better yet, keep plastic out of the ocean.

Live oaks bend but don't break. Saw palmettos crowd the ground like leafy bodyguards, while Spanish moss hangs from branches like nature's fringe. This maritime forest is one of the best remaining examples of this rare habitat in the United States. Thanks to its national seashore status, the island has been spared from the concrete creep seen on other coastlines.\nWhat you see here is the forest as it's been for centuries—a few ruins from the days of Scottish American industrialist Thomas Carnegie and the occasional feral horses grazing through. The horses are descendants of animals left by settlers long gone, and they're now unofficial mascots of the area. Alongside them, you might spot armadillos digging through the undergrowth, woodpeckers hammering tree trunks or raccoons engaging in tiny heists. Trails like the South End Trail or the Parallel Trail weave through dense foliage, sometimes giving glimpses of marshes or hidden historic sites.

Seljalandsfoss, located along Iceland's South Coast, offers a stunning backdrop for this astronomical event. The 60-metre waterfall drops from cliffs that once marked the country's coastline. The cascading water is part of the Seljalandsa River, originating from the volcanic glacier Eyjafjallajökull. The volcano under the icecap last erupted in 2010, causing disruption for locals and air traffic.\nVisitors can walk behind the falls into a small cave, offering a unique perspective and making it a favourite spot for photographers. Floodlights illuminate the waterfall at night, creating a magical scene. If you are planning a vacation during the summer solstice, Seljalandsfoss is worth adding to your travel bucket list. Whether you're a nature enthusiast or a photography lover, this experience promises unforgettable memories.",

		"description": "World Rainforest Day is not just a calendar event—it's a call to action. Established in 2017 by Rainforest Partnership—a nonprofit environmental organisation—the day raises awareness about the importance of rainforests and mobilises efforts to protect them.\nOne notable region of the Amazon rainforest is in Ecuador. Although smaller than Brazil's share, it's considered one of the most biologically dense areas on Earth. It also shelters an extraordinary range of life—jaguars, macaws, black caimans, electric eels and medicinal plants, many still unknown to science. This part of the rainforest is home to Indigenous groups, including uncontacted tribes whose territories are legally protected. But their way of life is increasingly threatened by industrial activities, especially oil drilling. World Rainforest Day reminds us that the protection of rainforests is possible through personal choices and collective action. From reducing paper use to supporting rainforest-friendly products, people can make tangible impacts that reach Ecuador's Amazon and beyond.",

The city, once called 'the Florence on the Elbe,' was nearly wiped off the map in 1945 during World War II. Since then, it has rebuilt itself into a place where modern museums, Baroque buildings and riverside views share the same frame. Much of the city's oldest architecture can be found in the boroughs of Altstadt (Old Town) and Neustadt (New Town). The surrounding neighbourhoods, originally planned by Saxon monarchs in the 18th and 19th centuries, are named after Saxon sovereigns like Friedrichstadt and Albertstadt.\nWhile you're here, consider strolling through Zwinger—a palatial complex—for a glimpse of royal history, or attend a performance at the Semperoper, where opera and architecture meet. The Old Masters Picture Gallery and the Green Vault are must-sees for art and history fans. Don't skip Neustadt—it has a trendier vibe, packed with street art, indie shops and craft beer spots. The Elbe river, stretching about 724 miles, flows through it all—wide, steady and quietly powerful.",

What you see at Arches National Park in Utah, United States, is the result of over 300 million years of erosion, uplift and weathering. These arches were formed when salt beds were left behind by ancient seas. Over time, layers of sandstone cracked, shifted and slowly wore away, revealing more than 2,000 natural arches. These formations are made mostly of Entrada and Navajo sandstone. The park was recognised as a national monument in 1929 and was later upgraded to national park status in 1971.\nDelicate Arch, in Arches National Park, is one of the most recognisable natural arches in the American Southwest. Originally known by several other names—including 'the Chaps' and 'Salt Wash Arch'—it wasn't officially called Delicate Arch until the 1930s, after a scientific expedition described it as 'delicate-looking.' It is Utah's unofficial mascot, appearing on everything from state licence plates to a United States postage stamp issued in 1996 to mark 100 years of Utah statehood. The arch is accessible via a moderately difficult hike that climbs over slickrock and skirts steep drop-offs. Whether you're a geology enthusiast or simply looking for a view worth the effort, Delicate Arch delivers.",

This ancient formation, pictured here, seems as if nature itself has sculpted a mythical creature forever poised to drink from the sea. Estimated to be 500 million years old, the rock's uncanny resemblance to a horse bending its neck is the result of wind and wave erosion.

The best views are from the elevated track between Camel Rock and Murunna Point, while the more daring can scramble around from Camel Rock Surf Beach, though only safely at low tide.\nBermagui, about 240 miles south of Sydney, sits under Gulaga, also known as Mount Dromedary. Gulaga is a sacred mountain for the Yuin peoples, an Australian Aboriginal group, who call it Mother Mountain.

The splendid leaf frog, or splendid treefrog, is a rainforest resident with a flair for the dramatic: neon legs, sticky feet and a disappearing act. One minute it's a humble green leaf, the next it's a flash of colour mid-leap, startling predators. This frog lives high in the canopies of Central and South America, especially in Costa Rica, Panama and parts of Ecuador and Colombia. This amphibian is a nocturnal ninja, spending its days snoozing on leaves and its nights foraging for insects. With vertical pupils and a golden glow, its oversized eyes help this frog spot prey in the dark. Thanks to sticky toe pads and strong limbs, it can cling to branches and leaves like a pro, even in the canopy's slippery heights.\nBreeding season gets creative. Females lay their eggs on leaves overhanging small pools or puddles. Once the eggs hatch, the tadpoles drop into the water below—no parental supervision required. With a dash of colour, a splash of stealth and a leap of faith, this species knows how to keep things un-frog-ettable.",

The tropics span a broad region between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn, including parts of Asia, Africa, Oceania, Central America and South America. Nearly 40% of the global population lives in this band, which also hosts 80% of the world's biodiversity. It's rich in culture, nature and history—but also under pressure from rising temperatures, deforestation and fast-paced urban growth.\nFor a tropical tale with extra flavour, look no further than Pulau Ay, photographed here. Nutmeg was once one of the world's most sought-after commodities—and this tiny island in Indonesia's Banda Islands played a key role in its global trade. It once sparked global rivalries and deadly sea battles, influencing the geopolitical boundaries of the modern world. Today, Pulau Ay is a place where reefs shine, nutmeg continues to thrive and history lingers in moss-covered forts.

The blast released energy equal to 10–15 megatons of trinitrotoluene (TNT), a standard measure of explosive force. Since then, craters like Arizona's Barringer, Quebec's Manicouagan and others have helped scientists study what happens when space rocks hit Earth.\nWolfe Creek Crater in Western Australia, pictured here, was created by a meteorite estimated to have weighed over 14,000 tonnes.

What began as a confederation of Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia has grown into a nation of 10 provinces and 3 territories. Originally called Dominion Day, the name was changed to Canada Day in 1982—the same year the Constitution Act was signed, granting the country full control over its constitution. While Canada Day is not the country's 'Independence Day' in the American sense, it's the closest thing to it. Locals celebrate this holiday with fireworks, parades, concerts and community events. Ottawa, the capital, hosts one of the biggest celebrations, featuring music and speeches on Parliament Hill. Red-and-white flags, maple leaf face paint and singalongs of the national anthem, 'O Canada,' are all part of the day.\nOn this day, it is hard to miss how the red and white houses in Tilting mirror the colours of the flag, as seen in the image. Tilting, a village on Fogo Island at Canada's eastern edge, was settled by Irish immigrants in the 18th century. It remains a unique example of an Irish outport community that has preserved its cultural identity. The bright fishing sheds and homes weren't painted just for aesthetics; the hues once made buildings easier to spot during heavy fog or snowfall. These vivid colours also reflect the practical, resourceful life of the people who settled here.",

Native to the Indo-Pacific, from western Indonesia to Taiwan and the Great Barrier Reef, this species lives on the edges of coral reefs. This fish is easily distinguished by the spine extending from each cheek—hence the name. Groups of spine-cheeked anemonefish form around a single dominant female, and if she disappears, the top male steps up—literally changing sex to take her place. It thrives in warm, shallow waters and sticks close to its chosen sea anemone.\nThe closest marine companion of a spine-cheeked anemonefish is the bubble-tip anemone, as seen in the image. These anemones don't all look alike—their appearances often vary with age, depth and whether they host anemonefish. This species offers the perfect mix of cover and protection. In return, the fish defend the anemone from threats and remove debris from its surface.

The gently winding waterway is fed by Rainbow Springs, one of Florida's largest springs. The water that bubbles up here comes from a 770-square-mile area and eventually flows into the Withlacoochee River.\nThe Rainbow River's transparent waters are perfect for swimming and snorkelling, and they maintain a constant temperature of over 20°C year-round. The park's history dates to the late 1880s, when hard rock phosphate was discovered in the area, leading to the boomtown era. This period saw the rapid growth of a small community called Juliette near the springs, driven by the phosphate mining industry.

Its streamlined body, reinforced skull and built-in shock absorbers, such as spongy bone plates and air sacs beneath the skin, make these high-impact dives both powerful and safe. Once underwater, the gannet uses its wings and webbed feet to swim after fish, diving as deep as 21 metres and staying submerged for up to 30 seconds. Its forward-facing eyes provide excellent depth perception, while hidden nostrils prevent water from rushing in during those lightning-fast descents.

		"description": "The Bahamas comes alive with colour, music and pride today as the nation marks its Independence Day. First recorded by Europeans in 1492 when Christopher Columbus arrived, the islands were initially under Spanish rule. They later came briefly under American control before becoming a British colony. After decades of legal negotiations and a growing push for self-governance, the Bahamas transitioned to full independence on this day in 1973.\nIn the lead-up to July 10, Bahamians across the archipelago take part in spirited celebrations, including National Pride Day, ecumenical services and community walks and runs. These events shine a spotlight on the nation's vibrant culture, heritage and deep sense of patriotism. And what better backdrop for such festivities than the breathtaking turquoise waters that surround the islands? The shallow, white sandbanks reflect sunlight in a way that gives the ocean its signature electric-blue glow, pictured here. Whether you're snorkeling among coral reefs, watching fireworks from a beachfront, or cruising the Exuma Cays under the golden sun, it seems the ocean sparkles just a little brighter on Independence Day.",

		"description": "We are living in a full house, and it is getting fuller. With 8.2 billion people and counting, World Population Day highlights how that growth affects cities, food and the future. First observed in 1989, the day focuses on how unchecked population growth affects sustainability. The event was inspired by Five Billion Day in 1987, which marked the approximate date when the global population hit that milestone. As cities expand, green spaces shrink and agriculture competes for limited land and water resources. But there is a way forward—investing in education, improving access to healthcare and building smarter cities can balance growth with sustainability.\nOn a global scale, India remains the most populous country in 2025 with over 1.46 billion people, followed by China at 1.41 billion. The United States trails with around 339 million, though its growth is slowing and aging populations are becoming a new challenge. The United Kingdom ranks 22nd with over 69 million people. Tokyo, the world's largest city with around 37.2 million people, illustrates the realities of high-density urban life: overcrowded spaces, transport congestion and rising demand for services. World Population Day is more than a head count—it's a call for better planning and long-term thinking to ensure future generations can thrive on a planet with finite resources.",

This stretch of savanna in southwestern Kenya teems with wildlife—from elephants stomping through bushes to cheetahs scanning the horizon. Yet sometimes it's the smaller creatures that grab attention—like the Thomson's gazelles featured in today's image.\nKnown as 'tommies,' Thomson's gazelles are among the fastest animals in Africa, reaching speeds of up to 50 miles per hour. They thrive in the Mara's short grass plains, which provide a clear view of approaching predators. Though adults may seem to be grazing peacefully, their ears are always tuned to nearby movements. Mating occurs year-round, peaking just before the rainy season. Males hold territories, waiting for females to pass through. After a five- to six-month gestation period, the female gives birth to one fawn, weighing around 2 to 3 kilograms. For the first few weeks, the small gazelle stays hidden most of the day. The mother returns briefly to nurse, minimising attention from predators. These early days are crucial as the young learn to run and blend in. Despite their delicate appearance, tommies are tough. Many join the great migration during the dry season, relying on their agility and the awareness of wildebeests and zebras to evade danger in search of greener plains.",

From Stone Age tools to the minerals powering modern civilisation, rocks have been essential throughout our journey. International Rock Day celebrates this enduring impact, inviting us to explore the science of rocks, admire their natural beauty and recognise the rich variety they add to our world.\nIf you're wondering where to see geology in action, Iceland is a great place to explore. Today's image takes us to Kálfshamarsvík—a secluded cove on the country's remote Skagi peninsula. Unlike Iceland's famous black sand beaches, this cove's shore is strewn with large, smooth pebbles, while its fiery volcanic past still reveals itself in the towering cliffs. Here, evidence of volcanic activity is on full display in the form of rare hexagonal basalt columns. These sea cliffs are shaped into natural sculptures so symmetrical that they look almost man-made. These striking formations were created around 2 million years ago, when thick basalt lava cooled slowly, contracting and cracking into geometric shapes that formed near-perfect hexagons. Though Iceland is full of volcanic marvels, formations like these are rare, making this quiet cove truly remarkable.",

They are symbols of ocean health, which is why Shark Awareness Day draws attention to these apex predators that help maintain balance in marine ecosystems. Protecting sharks means preserving the health of entire ocean environments—and ultimately, securing a sustainable future for all life. With many shark species facing the threat of extinction, this day is all about appreciating their ancient legacy and learning how we can help keep them off the endangered list.\nTake the blue shark, featured here, for example—sleek, wide-ranging and undeniably captivating. It's the only member of its genus that prefers the deep waters of temperate and tropical oceans. While typically a laid-back swimmer, it's capable of sudden bursts of speed when needed. Blue sharks are famous for their epic migrations—some travel from New England to South America, guided by seasonal changes, food availability and favourable environmental conditions. They give birth to live young and are known for their large litters—ranging from 25 to over 100 pups. After birth, the young head to special nursery zones, far from adult habitats, where they can grow and learn the ways of the sea.",

Active from mid-July through late August, it reaches its spectacular peak on the night of August 12 into the early hours of August 13 this year. The Perseids light up the skies when Earth passes through a trail of icy and rocky debris left behind by Comet Swift–Tuttle, which last passed close to our planet in 1992. These meteors are called the Perseids because they appear to streak from the direction of the constellation Perseus.\nFor those hoping to catch a glimpse of this breathtaking show, the Perseid meteor shower is best viewed from the Northern Hemisphere, extending down to the mid-southern latitudes. Observers can head to dark locations away from light pollution, preferably after midnight and before dawn. One such vantage point is Great Basin National Park in Nevada, United States, seen in today's image, where ancient bristlecone pines stand beneath a sky ablaze with shooting stars. These remarkable trees are the oldest non-clonal species on Earth.

From late June to mid-July, this high plateau transforms into a purple sea of lavender. Situated at 590 metres above sea level and spanning approximately 300 square miles, it is one of the largest areas in France dedicated to lavender cultivation.\nLavender has flourished in Provence for centuries. The ancient Romans brought the plant to southern France, using it for bathing, cooking and healing. The word itself comes from 'lavare,' Latin for 'to wash.' By the Middle Ages, local monks were cultivating it for medicinal purposes. The real boom came in the 19th century, when the perfume industry in nearby Grasse took off. Over time, lavender fields spread across Provence, especially in high-sun, well-drained areas like Valensole. Today, 1,700 growers tend to around 62,000 acres of these shrubs. They cultivate both traditional lavender—for perfumes and skincare—and lavandin, the longer-stemmed cousin often found in household cleaning products and air fresheners. So don't just leave it to chance—plan ahead, follow the scent trail and let your summer bloom with lavender memories.",

Also known as the American moon moth, this striking insect—with its lime-green wings and white body—can be found across North America. Its caterpillars are also green and are known for their impressive size, as well as their ability to emit clicking sounds and regurgitate intestinal contents as a defence mechanism against predators.\nNational Moth Week, held during the last full week of July, encourages communities to host 'mothing' events, where participants use light or bait to attract moths for observation and data collection. This citizen science initiative began in 2012 in Central New Jersey and has since expanded to over 90 countries, engaging people in the fascinating world of moths. With their incredible diversity and ecological importance, moths play crucial roles in pollination and serve as a vital food source for other wildlife.

That changed in 1837, when Queen Victoria moved in and made it the monarchy's principal residence. She brought in architects, added wings and gave the building a proper royal makeover. Fast forward to 1993—when the palace opened to the public for the first time. It began as a way to raise funds for repairing Windsor Castle after the 1992 fire.

They protect shorelines from erosion, buffer communities against storms and serve as nurseries for countless marine animals. Their tangled root systems not only stabilise sediment but also provide shelter for juvenile fish, crabs and birds. Mangroves also trap carbon at rates far higher than most forests, making them powerful allies in the fight against climate change.

		"description": "Think you can hear silence? Try sitting in a jeep in Kanha National Park in the heart of India, waiting for a Bengal tiger to appear. Every year, International Tiger Day draws attention to these powerful yet endangered big cats. Bengal tigers are more than their unmistakable orange coats and black stripes. They are apex predators, essential to the health and balance of the ecosystems they inhabit. By keeping prey populations like deer and wild boar in check, tigers help shape vegetation patterns and support the overall biodiversity of their environments.\nOne of the best places to see this delicate natural balance in action is Kanha National Park. Among India's oldest protected areas, it was first declared a reserve forest in 1879 and later a national park in 1955. It then became one of the first nine tiger reserves under Project Tiger in 1973, a landmark initiative launched to halt the steep decline in the species. Yet, despite decades of progress, tigers still face threats from habitat fragmentation, poaching and conflict with humans. That's why landscapes like Kanha remain critical—not just for tigers, but for the future of forests and wildlife conservation across the planet.",

		"description": "What do giant handshakes painted on the ground have to do with friendship? Quite a lot, actually. Celebrated every July 30, the International Day of Friendship reminds us that tackling global challenges, like poverty, violence and injustice, starts with something surprisingly simple: human connection. That's exactly what artist Saype had in mind with 'Beyond Walls,' a series of massive, biodegradable land-art murals featuring interlinked hands. Symbolising unity and solidarity, these works have stretched across five continents. At Expo 2020 Dubai, Saype's 11th installation covered over 1,400 square metres of grass in Al Forsan Park. It formed a striking black-and-white handshake that could only be fully appreciated from above, as seen here. The piece, made with eco-friendly paint, was unveiled on Switzerland's National Day, supported by the Swiss Pavilion.\nProclaimed by the UN in 2011, the International Day of Friendship calls for building bonds across borders, cultures and generations. It's a vision of peace crafted not just in policy rooms but also on playgrounds, in neighbourhoods and in public spaces—even on the ground itself. So, today, take a cue from Saype: reach out, connect and be part of a global human chain. Sometimes, the most powerful message begins with a single gesture.",

Kalalau Beach, at the end of Kauai's Kalalau Trail, is where tired feet meet a sandy reward. The only land access is the trail itself, a rugged trek through valleys and along coastal cliffs. During summer, some arrive by kayak, but all visitors need permits to stay.\nLong before camping permits and composting toilets, this remote stretch supported generations of Native Hawaiians. Thanks to freshwater streams and fertile soil, early Hawaiians farmed taro (a root vegetable widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions) in stone terraces. Fishing, farming and a deep spiritual connection to the land (āina) shaped daily life. Remnants of temples and house sites still lie hidden in the valley's folds. By the 1920s, most residents had left due to disease, Western contact and shifting land use. In recent decades, off-the-grid seekers sought refuge here until state protections were implemented. Today, Kalalau is both sacred and scenic—a place where history lingers with every crashing wave.",

The story began in 1947, when eight theatre groups turned up uninvited to the Edinburgh International Festival. They performed anyway. That spirit of rebellion stuck, and the Fringe was born.\nNow it's the world's largest arts festival, with thousands of shows crammed into three action-packed weeks. Anyone can perform. If you have an idea and a venue, you're in. Even a shipping container counts—yes, that really happened. Comedy is the unofficial king of the festival, but there's also drama, dance, drag, musicals, magic, mime, spoken word, circus and acts that defy all categories. One year, a man did an hour-long monologue from inside a fridge. Another year featured a full Shakespeare play in Klingon. Street performers flood the Royal Mile, pictured here, offering sneak peeks, juggling acts and flyers. The Edinburgh Festival Fringe is where experimental performances and high-end theatre thrive.

These annual plants are known for their large, daisy-like flowers and radiant charm. While sunflowers come in shades of red, orange and maroon, it's the classic yellow blooms with brown centres that are the most common.\nBeyond their good looks, sunflowers are grown for their tasty seeds, which are snacked on, pressed for cooking oil or offered as a treat for birds. Their value isn't a modern discovery—Native Americans cultivated them thousands of years ago. Sunflowers were often planted alongside corn, beans and squash as a symbolic 'fourth sister,' reflecting their importance long before they became garden icons. That long-standing legacy continues today, as sunflowers remain a staple in fields and backyards.",

Known as the world's largest owl species by length, which ranges from 61 to 84 centimetres, they span the Northern Hemisphere and are found in both the Eastern and Western Hemispheres. Unlike many birds, they don't build their own nests—instead, they repurpose those left behind by large raptors or settle into broken treetops and hollow trunks. Despite their size and status as apex predators, they are non-aggressive, rarely clashing with rivals or intruders.

		"description": "Not every science lesson requires a classroom. In La Jolla, in California, United States, tide pools teach you about ocean life—right at your feet. Along the rocky shoreline of this San Diego coastal neighbourhood, tide pools form during low tide as seawater gets trapped in natural depressions. These shallow pools form naturally along La Jolla's rocky shorelines, especially near Windansea Beach, Shell Beach, South Casa Beach and Hospital Point. The water that remains trapped in sandstone and reef depressions creates habitats for everything from sea hares to brittle stars.\nOver time, the tide pools are created through the process of erosion—waves hit the sandstone and limestone coastlines until they carve out pockets that hold water. Twice a day, as the tide moves in and out, these spaces flood and drain, challenging the survival skills of everything inside. Winter months, when tides are lowest during daylight hours, are ideal for observing them. And remember, these pools are protected under California's Marine Life Protection Act. Enjoy the view, observe those residing in the depressions, take pictures, but don't disturb anything. It is marine biology in motion, and it's free.",

		"description": "It looks like this small creature is playing a game, right? But when a baby ring-tailed lemur wraps its tail around or gives it a tug, it's actually working on crucial skills. The infants spend their early weeks hanging tight to their mom, first clinging to her belly and later to her back. As they grow, they separate from their mom, and tail-chasing becomes part of how they learn balance, coordination and group play. These primates use their long tails for communication as well. Raised like flags during group movement, the tails help them stick together in open terrain. Loud, rhythmic calls, scent markings and 'stink fights' between males add to the social drama.\nRing-tailed lemurs are found only in southern and southwestern Madagascar, where they live in dry forests, spiny thickets and rocky outcrops. They live in female-dominated groups, sometimes up to 30 individuals. Habitat loss due to slash-and-burn agriculture and charcoal production has pushed them into vulnerable status, despite being one of the most studied lemurs.",

When her husband, John de Balliol, passed away, Dervorguilla had his heart embalmed and placed in a silver casket. She carried it with her everywhere, like a medieval love letter on repeat. When she died, the heart was buried with her at the abbey she named in his memory—Dulce Cor, or 'Sweet Heart.'\nFast forward to today, and the abbey's skeletal remains still echo with romance. The soaring arches, weathered but proud, are a popular stop for history buffs, romantics and photographers chasing Scotland's softer side. While monks no longer chant in its cloisters, the ruin sings its own kind of hymn—a ballad of love that refused to be buried.",

		"description": "Built to brave storms and steer ships to safety, lighthouses now glow as symbols of heritage, wonder and connection. Each year on the third weekend of August, the International Lighthouse Lightship Weekend brings together people from around the globe to celebrate these coastal icons. The event was launched in 1998 by John Forsyth and Mike Dalrymple of Scotland's Ayr Amateur Radio Group. It aims to raise awareness about preserving lighthouses and lightships while also promoting amateur radio and encouraging international goodwill.\nAmong the many lighthouses that carry this legacy forward is the Lyngvig Lighthouse in Denmark, featured here. Standing over 38 metres tall, this tower was built in 1906 atop a 17-metre dune along the west coast of Jutland—the country's westernmost region. Made with a concrete foundation and brick walls and finished with teak-framed windows and doors, the lighthouse originally required a team of three keepers. They maintained its light until 1965. It has been operating automatically ever since. Following a temporary closure in 2024 due to structural concerns, the lighthouse is now open to the public again.",

		"description": "There's no easing into the wild here—the Avalanche Lake Trail carves a bold path through rock scrambles, narrow ledges and alpine serenity. Tucked away in New York's Adirondack High Peaks, this 9-acre (3.6 hectares) alpine lake sits at over 850 metres between Mount Colden and Avalanche Mountain. Shaped by ancient glaciers, the lake is framed by dramatic cliffs and rugged terrain that echo its icy origins. Its most striking feature is the Trap Dike—an over 300-metre rock canyon flanked by steep walls, making the lake one of the most awe-inspiring sights in the Adirondacks. Massive avalanches carved these cliffs, leaving behind the dramatic landscape that gave Avalanche Lake its name. The Avalanche Lake Trail begins at the Adirondack Loj, a well-known launch point for adventures in the High Peaks. Spanning about 9.6 miles round trip with a more than 400-metre elevation, the hike may seem manageable on paper—but it's the uneven terrain that truly tests your mettle.",

This vast waterfall system stretches nearly two miles and features more than 270 individual cascades, each offering a unique display of tumbling water and shimmering mist.\nToday's image captures one of the spectacular sights on the Argentine side—The Three Musketeers Falls, a trio of powerful streams plunging side by side into the Iguazú River below, framed by lush subtropical rainforest. Interestingly, although the falls are located in Argentina, they are only visible and accessible from the Brazilian side.\nThe falls are part of Iguazú National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site that protects the region's rich biodiversity and offers visitors a network of trails and catwalks for panoramic views and close-up encounters with the thundering water.

Bonifacio didn't begin as a picturesque tourist destination—it was originally established as a coastal fortification and has spent centuries guarding one of the Mediterranean's busiest sea lanes. Established in 828 CE by Boniface II of Tuscany, the commune gradually became a meeting point for traders, soldiers and sailors—each group contributing to the evolution of the town's structure. Bonifacio is divided into two sections, with the 'vieille ville' (old town)—also known as 'la Haute Ville' (the Upper City)—standing on a high cliff within the original citadel walls. Below, the marine area lines the narrow inlet with harbours, waterfront homes and a growing valley community.\nWhile here, the Bonifacio Citadel is a must-see. First built in the 9th century and expanded over time, it invites visitors to wander through quiet passageways, old military buildings and cobblestone streets. Nearby, you can explore the Marine Cemetery, climb the King of Aragon's Stairway and visit the Bastion de l'Étendard, now home to a small museum.",

These ground-dwelling songbirds belong to the Oenanthe genus and are known for their upright posture and habit of hopping or sprinting between perches. Despite the name, wheatears have nothing to do with wheat or ears—the name is a twist on the old phrase 'white arse,' pointing to the bird's distinctive white rump found in most species.\nGlobally, there are around 20 species of wheatears, but in North America, the northern wheatear is the one you're most likely to encounter. It weighs less than an ounce, but travels thousands of miles between its summer homes in Alaska and northern Canada to its wintering grounds in Africa. Its migration route is one of the longest for a bird its size, crossing oceans and continents. Unlike many backyard songbirds, wheatears prefer wide-open spaces with low vegetation, where they can sprint and pounce on insects. And while most North American birders might only catch them in the far north, wheatears are widespread across Europe, Asia and Africa.",

The wheat-covered slopes shift in colour with every passing season. In spring, the hills turn lush shades of green as young wheat and barley begin to grow, while summer transforms them into dry, golden browns as the crops near harvest.\nOften hailed as one of Washington State's most serene natural wonders, the Palouse owes its signature rolling hills to an ancient and fascinating geological story. These dune-like hills were shaped over thousands of years—not by rivers or tectonic shifts, but by windblown dust and fine silt, known as 'loess,' carried from the arid Southwest. During the Ice Ages, glaciers from Canada ground rock into fine 'glacial flour,' which flowed into the prehistoric Glacial Lake Missoula. When ice dams broke, floods swept across eastern Washington, leaving behind layers of silt. Prevailing winds later carried that dust to this region, settling it into the hills we see today.",

These medium-sized deer have been strutting through British woodlands and parklands for centuries. Though they look right at home, they weren't born here. The Romans likely brought them over, and the Normans later made them common in hunting parks. Now, they're regulars in landscapes from Sussex to Scotland.\nIn summer, these animals sport a reddish-brown coat with white spots. Come winter, they trade it for a darker, greyer version. Bucks (males) grow broad, shovel-shaped antlers, unlike the pointy racks of red or roe deer. In autumn, the bucks clash antlers in the rutting season, competing for the attention of does (females). Fallow deer graze mainly on grasses and leaves, but they won't turn their noses up at herbs, shrubs or the occasional snack from a fruit tree. Despite their poise, they're quick to bolt if spooked. That flash of white tail you see? That's their way of saying 'time to run.' It's also a signal to the rest of the herd.",

Every August bank holiday weekend, Notting Hill turns up the volume, the colour and the spirit, as one of the world's biggest street festivals takes over west London. The Notting Hill Carnival is more than feathers and steel drums; it's a celebration of Caribbean culture, resistance and rhythm, all sashaying down Ladbroke Grove like it owns the road. What started in 1966 as a response to racial tensions has grown into a joyful rebellion of music, movement and mouthwatering food. It's now a fixture on London's cultural calendar, with over two million people attending annually.\nThe carnival's masquerade bands spend months creating dazzling costumes, many of which reflect themes of heritage and identity. Steelpan orchestras, soca sound systems, calypso singers, reggae DJs—if it's Caribbean, it's playing. More than 30 sound systems are scattered across the neighbourhood. Hungry?

		"description": "If fairy tales had architects, they might've come up with something like Alberobello in Italy. But instead of magic wands, it was limestone, mortar-free masonry and—according to some theories—a bit of tax evasion that built this town's signature homes: the trulli. These are whitewashed stone houses topped with dry-stacked limestone roofs shaped like upside-down ice cream cones. It's an ancient building technique, and in this case, a clever one. Back in the 14th century, locals were reportedly trying to avoid property taxes by constructing homes that could be quickly dismantled when the king's tax collector came around.\nAlberobello's trulli aren't hidden one-offs. Entire districts—like Rione Monti and Aia Piccola—are packed with these quirky structures. Some are still lived in, while others have been transformed into cafés, souvenir shops and pint-sized museums. You'll even find a church built in trullo style. In 1996, UNESCO gave the trulli of Alberobello the heritage stamp of approval. It's not every day that a loophole becomes a landmark.",

Found in the Americas, Asia, Africa and parts of Europe, these birds are often seen wading through wetlands, tidal flats and quiet streams. Patient and precise, they stand motionless for minutes, waiting for just the right moment to deliver a lightning-fast strike. Fish are their main prey, but they also eat frogs, reptiles and even small mammals.\nIn the late 1800s, the great egret's beautiful plumes became a must-have in women's fashion across North America, driving their population down by an estimated 95%. The killing might have continued if not for two Boston socialites, Harriet Hemenway and Minna Hall, who led a boycott of the feather trade. Their activism helped launch the National Audubon Society. It also pushed the US Congress to pass the Weeks–McLean Law in 1913, which banned market hunting and protected migratory birds. Today, the great egret is a powerful conservation success story thanks to more than a century of legal protection and public action. It also serves as the Audubon Society's symbol.",

It has ten entrances, nine of which are gated. At its centre stands the equestrian statue of Philip III, added in 1848.

Their mouths can stretch over a metre wide, but they feed by suction, not biting. Each has a unique pattern of white spots and stripes—no two alike—used by researchers to track individuals. Their breeding patterns remain largely a mystery, but they are ovoviviparous, meaning pups hatch inside the mother before being born alive.

Originally envisioned on a much grander scale—twice its current size—the cathedral's fate was tied to the fortunes of the silver mines. As the mines declined, so did the ambitions. By 1588, only the iconic three-peaked roof had been completed, and a temporary wall signalled the halt of construction. In the years that followed, the Jesuits took over, gradually introducing Baroque elements into the original Gothic design. Restoration efforts finally took shape in the late 19th century, led by architects Josef Mocker and Ludvik Labler.",

Wide, clean and ready for volleyball or just flopping down with a good book, it's ideal for sunbathers and sandcastle architects alike. And yes, 'Baywatch' was filmed along Santa Monica Bay. Feel free to run in slow motion.\nThen there's the Santa Monica Pier. Built in 1909 and still standing tall on wooden legs, it's got an amusement park called Pacific Park, arcade, restaurants and that famous solar-powered Ferris wheel. Up for more movement? The Marvin Braude Bike Trail, or the Strand, is a 22-mile bike path that zips right through the beach. Rent a cruiser and ride past rollerbladers, dog walkers and tourists trying to juggle ice cream and selfies. Here, the surf is another draw. Beginners can catch their first wave here, while pros keep an eye on the swells further out.",

		"description": "They fly backward, dive-bomb rivals and travel further than most road trippers. Meet the rufous hummingbird—photographed in Golden Gate Park, San Francisco, California, United States. The bird, one of nine species in the genus Selasphorus, gets its name from its rusty, reddish-orange feathers. Males flash copper backs and red throat patches that shimmer in the sun. Females are more subdued but still carry streaks of rufous on their sides and tails.\nThey may look sweet, but these pollinators are known for their aggressive behaviour, often chasing away not just other hummingbirds, but also bees and butterflies. At about 8 centimetres long, this nectar-seeker is a frequent flyer in the most literal sense. Each year, it migrates from Mexico to Alaska and back—a round-trip of up to 8,000 miles. That's one of the longest migrations relative to body size in the bird world. And here's the kicker: many return to the exact same gardens and feeders year after year.",

Every September, thousands lace up in Newcastle upon Tyne, ready to pound the pavement from city streets to seaside views. Founded in 1981 by former Olympic bronze medallist Brendan Foster, the half marathon has grown into the world's largest of its kind, regularly attracting over 60,000 runners. The 13.1-mile route starts on the central motorway and finishes along the South Shields seafront. It takes runners past landmarks like The Glasshouse International Centre for Music, pictured here, and across the Tyne Bridge—often cheered on by a passing Red Arrows flyover.\nParticipants aren't all elite athletes. From record chasers to charity fundraisers, and first-timers to veterans who've run every single year, the field is as varied as the weather in the North East. And with countless charities benefitting from the event, each step taken is a stride toward change. This run is also a showcase of local pride. Bands line the route, crowds bring homemade signs and volunteers keep energy high. Even if you're not running, it's hard not to get swept up in the atmosphere—spectating is practically a sport of its own.",

		"description": "Quick, clever and always on the move—meet the Eurasian red squirrel, a leafy treetop resident found across much of Europe and Asia. While it prefers the shelter of forests, this agile creature easily adapts to gardens and parks. It builds its nest, called a drey, high in the fork of a tree using twigs to form a domed structure about 25 to 30 centimetres wide. The female featured here is gathering moss—one of several soft materials, along with bark, leaves and grass, that line the nest and turn it into a snug, well-insulated retreat. These rodents may also take over tree hollows or abandoned woodpecker holes when available.\nTypically solitary and quite shy, they rarely share food or space. However, during colder months, it's not uncommon for several individuals to use the same nest to stay warm. Their social organisation is shaped by dominance hierarchies, both within and between the sexes. While males aren't always dominant over females, the top-ranking individuals tend to be older and larger. Dominant males also tend to occupy larger home ranges than subordinate males or most females.",

		"description": "'Make hay while the sun shines' may sound like an old proverb, but in farming it's a practical truth. Hay baling plays a crucial role in agriculture worldwide. It involves cutting, drying and packaging grasses to feed livestock during the colder months. The process depends heavily on the weather: the grass must be dry before it's baled, or it risks moulding. Farmers must act quickly once a dry spell arrives, making it a seasonal race.\nThe practice of baling dates back centuries, evolving from horse-powered balers of the 1800s to today's high-powered machines that can wrap and eject bales in minutes. In North Yorkshire, England—where today's image was taken—the rolling lowlands and upland meadows create ideal conditions for growing and curing high-quality hay. With grazing livestock such as sheep and cattle making up around 40% of farm holdings, hay is a key feed resource supporting the region's rural economy. So, when you see golden fields dotted with neat, sunlit rolls, you're witnessing the result of careful timing and hard work. It's a tradition that remains as important today as ever.",

The city likely takes its name from 'Gdania,' an earlier name for the Motława river that runs through it.\nThe city originated as a Slavic fort in the late 10th century and was first recorded in 997, when it came under the early influence of the Polish state. Over the centuries, Gdańsk has experienced Polish, German and independent rule, each leaving a mark on the region's identity. The Main City draws most visitors, especially to the lively promenade that runs along Ulica Długa (Long Street) and Długi Targ (Long Market). Flanked by decorative gates and lined with stately townhouses rebuilt in 17th-century style, this pedestrian stretch is steeped in charm. Once the ceremonial path for Polish royalty, it's now fondly known as the Royal Route.

First observed in 2022, World Dolphin Day shines a light on these intelligent marine mammals and the oceans they rely on. The day encourages people to learn about their behaviour and the threats they face. Over 40 dolphin species swim our seas, from the Māui dolphin to the Irrawaddy dolphin. They're expert navigators, problem-solvers and team players. Some even form superpods—temporary gatherings of hundreds or thousands of dolphins moving together offshore.\nOff the coast of Marsa Alam in Egypt, pods of spinner dolphins glide through the warm waters of the Red Sea—as seen in today's image. True to their name, they can leap and spin in the air up to seven times in a single jump. Found in tropical waters across the Pacific, Indian and Atlantic Oceans, they rest during the day in calm bays and hunt offshore at night. But their predictable routines have left them vulnerable to unregulated tourism. Some conservation zones now limit visitor access to allow dolphins to rest undisturbed. The hope?

The Montreal Protocol, signed in 1987, led to a swift phase-out of ozone-depleting substances. Today, satellites show that the hole over Antarctica is shrinking. Scientists believe it could be fully healed by mid-century.\nOn September 16, we mark the International Day for the Preservation of the Ozone Layer—a celebration of science, global cooperation and collective will.

This young bull might not be ready to duel for territory or mates just yet, but rehearsal has already begun. He'll spar gently with others, learning how to move, how to hold his ground, how to rise in the ranks of the wild.

It marks the beginning of autumn in the Northern Hemisphere. From solar alignments to changing leaves, nature offers its own quiet signals that the season has shifted. While for most of us it may seem like just another day, ancient cultures paid close attention to this change. Sites like Chichén Itzá in Mexico and England's Stonehenge were designed to align with the rising or setting sun during equinox days.\nOne of the best places to catch the change in season? Fishlake National Forest in Utah, United States. As September rolls in, the aspen trees seen in today's image begin their annual transformation, turning vivid shades of yellow that ripple across the hills.

A member of the Ramphastidae family, which includes toucan barbets, it is one of more than 40 toucan species. Found from southern Mexico to northern Colombia, it spends much of its day plucking fruit with a rainbow-coloured bill about one-third of its total length. It also eats insects, eggs and small reptiles when available. The bill not only helps it eat but also keeps the toucan cool by radiating excess heat—thanks to the blood vessels running through it. This social bird often moves in small groups, chattering and gliding between treetops. With each wing measuring around 18–20 centimetres, the keel-billed toucan molts, or sheds its feathers, just once a year.\nWhen the breeding season arrives, a pair claims a tree cavity. The female lays two to four eggs, and both parents share incubation duty. The chicks hatch featherless, with closed eyes and tiny, pale bills. Over the weeks, their colours emerge and they begin taking short flights. So, if you catch a glimpse of one, remember: it's more than a pretty face—it's a smart, social and well-equipped rainforest multitasker.",

		"description": "Somewhere in the wide prairies of northeastern Wyoming, United States, stands Devils Tower, a stone formation that rises from the open plains. Once called Bear Lodge, the butte gained its current name during an 1875 expedition led by Colonel Richard Irving Dodge, possibly after an interpreter mistranslated a Native phrase as 'Bad God's Tower.' The missing apostrophe in its official title follows standard geographic naming conventions—hence, the signs read 'Devils Tower.' In 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt proclaimed it the nation's first national monument; a milestone whose anniversary falls today.\nAs you approach Devils Tower, every curve in the road unveils a new view—whether you're arriving from the highway, winding toward the visitor centre or following the Tower Trail on foot. The site's significance stretches far deeper than its dramatic geology. For centuries, numerous tribes from the Great Plains and Black Hills, including the Arapaho, Crow and Cheyenne, have been linked to this place. Each tribe preserves oral traditions about the Tower's creation. While many of these accounts share recurring themes, the details remain unique to every community. Devils Tower continues to embody a living chronicle of geology, heritage and the ever-changing relationship between humans and the natural world.",

It stands as a proud witness to the valour of the famed warrior clans—the Rajputs. Their name comes from the Sanskrit 'rajaputra,' meaning 'son of a king,' and they are celebrated for their noble lineage and martial traditions across northern India. The fort's stone walls have witnessed centuries of courage, pride and romance, remembered in the songs of Rajasthan's bards. According to legend, Bhim, a hero from the Hindu epic 'Mahabharata,' first laid its foundations.\nAs one of the largest forts in India, Chittorgarh encompasses 65 historic structures, including four palaces, 19 large temples, 20 reservoirs, four memorials and several victory towers. This fort has a circumference of about 8.1 miles and a maximum length of 3.1 miles. It is reached by a steep, zigzag ascent of just over half a mile from the plains, beginning with a limestone bridge over the Gambhiri River. Climbing this path and passing through its ancient gates, you can almost hear the echoes of battles and legends—inviting you to step into a living chapter of history.",

With survival smarts and turbo-charged feet, this tiny rodent proves that being 'least' is no reason to squirrel away your potential. Weighing less than a deck of cards and measuring under 25 centimetres from nose to tail, this species is North America's smallest chipmunk.\nWhen it's not sprinting up logs or vanishing into leaf piles, it is stuffing its face—literally. Its expandable cheek pouches help it haul seeds, berries and insects to storage spots. Come winter, it doesn't fully hibernate. Instead, it enters a light torpor, waking every so often for a snack. Not one for group living, each least chipmunk carves out its own territory every summer, usually with a hidden burrow and a backup food cache or ten. But if a predator wanders too close, you'll hear chip-chip-chip alarms sounding off.\nDid you know that a least chipmunk's memory is so sharp that it can remember the locations of hundreds of food caches, even after a long winter nap? So next time you forget where you parked, just remember—a chipmunk wouldn't have.",

Among its lesser-known treasures lies the Clark Range—the rugged, high-elevation spine seen in today's image.

This tiny Italian town is perched above the Val d'Orcia, surrounded by rolling hills that look exactly like you think Tuscany should: cypress trees, winding dirt roads, the occasional sheep. It's peaceful. And then you step inside the town walls, and it gets clever.\nPienza was once a regular medieval village called Corsignano. That is, until one of its sons became Pope Pius II and decided to transform his hometown. He hired architect Bernardo Rossellino and rebuilt the area based on Renaissance ideals of symmetry, order and harmony. The result? A site that feels intentional. The central square, Piazza Pio II, is flanked by a cathedral, a papal palace and a town hall, all arranged just so. Moreover, Pienza is known for pecorino cheese—sheep's milk, aged in interesting ways. And once a year, the whole town turns into a cheese arena for Fiera del Cacio, a festival featuring Cacio al Fuso—a game where people roll wheels of cheese at a target.",

Each house reflects a different colour of the spectrum. This isn't a curated tourist stop; these are lived-in homes, part of a neighbourhood shaped by the same thoughtful planning that makes Houten one of the most bike-friendly towns in the country.

Often misnamed 'koala bears,' these marsupials are actually closer to wombats and tend to be instantly recognisable by their stout, tailless bodies, fluffy ears and velvety black noses.\nTheir diet is notoriously selective—koalas feed almost exclusively on certain eucalyptus leaves laced with toxins that most animals can't digest. To survive, they sleep up to 20 hours a day while a specialised, bacteria-rich gut works to neutralise the poison. This slow-motion lifestyle is nature's masterstroke of adaptation.\nYet their future hangs in the balance. From habitat loss, disease and climate-driven threats like bushfires, koalas are at a critical crossroads. But forest restoration, dedicated sanctuaries and Indigenous-led conservation are beginning to turn the tide. With continued care, these gentle climbers can cling to the treetops (and to our hearts) as enduring symbols of Australia's wild spirit for generations to come.",

Since then, it has grown into an annual tradition of learning and celebration.\nFrom pioneers like Mary Seacole, the Crimean War nurse who stood shoulder to shoulder with Florence Nightingale, to cultural icons in music, literature and politics, this event brings overlooked legacies into focus. Few names resonate as strongly as Nelson Mandela's. Though his fight against apartheid was rooted in South Africa, his story found echoes in Britain. Jailed for 27 years for resisting apartheid, he walked free in 1990 and, just four years later, became South Africa's first Black president. During his years in prison, British activists kept the pressure alive with boycotts and marches. Mandela's eventual triumph symbolised that justice, though delayed, could never be silenced.",

The landscape hums with echoes of the past: dinosaurs left footprints on these cliffs long before Mesolithic hunters traced its streams over 8,000 years ago. In the 9th century, seafaring Norse Vikings settled here. Centuries later, the powerful MacLeod and MacDonald clans claimed these lands, their castles standing guard over countless battles and alliances.\nAmong the hills and hidden lochs, the Fairy Pools shimmer in emerald and turquoise, tumbling over volcanic rock—a place where, according to local tales, fairies once danced under the moonlight. Nearby, Loch Coruisk, the 'Cauldron of Waters,' tucked beneath the jagged Black Cuillin peaks, is said to be haunted by a kelpie, a shape-shifting water spirit. Red deer glide silently through the heather, rabbits vanish along secret trails and golden eagles wheel above. Glen Brittle is where geology, wildlife and human history intertwine.

		"description": "When a bird is called a starling, you'd expect it to be a bit of a show-off. True to its name, this little creature knows how to steal the spotlight. From shimmering feathers that glint green and purple in the sun, to its ability to mimic sounds, the starling is the headline act. Originally native to Europe and Asia, the common starling has spread across the globe. In the 19th century, a group of them were introduced to New York's Central Park by an enthusiast of birds mentioned in Shakespeare's plays.\nBrighton's West Pier may be a ruin, but when starlings gather above it, the scene is anything but broken. Each evening in autumn and winter, thousands of these small birds twist and turn in the air. The spectacle is called a murmuration, a term as musical as the sound of wings beating in unison. Scientists suggest the birds swoop and swirl to confuse predators, keep warm and share information about roosting spots. Whatever the reason, the result is a dance that has visitors gazing upward, phones in hand, hoping to catch a glimpse before the flock settles for the night.",

		"description": "Ever wondered what it's like to live on a movie set? Oia is about as close as it gets, part of Greece's Santorini archipelago. This village has appeared in films like 'The Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants' and 'Tomb Raider,' thanks to its Cycladic houses—cube-shaped homes with flat roofs—and cliffside views that feel almost unreal. Its unique architecture has roots in the late 19th century. Sailors and merchants carved houses right into the volcanic cliffs—cool in summer and warm in winter. The white-and-blue theme is also more than just for show: houses were painted with lime wash so rainwater would run off and be collected. Today, visitors wander its cobbled lanes, explore the Naval Maritime Museum or climb to the ruins of Agios Nikolaos Castle for unforgettable sunsets.\nNicknamed the 'Eagle's Nest,' Oia overlooks the volcanic islets of Palia and Nea Kameni, as well as Therasia, which was physically connected to Santorini before the Minoan eruption. And Santorini itself? Think of it as a crown of rock around the sea, a half-sunken caldera shaped by the eruption of 1600 BCE, one of the largest volcanic eruptions in human history.",

They break down dead matter, recycle nutrients and support tree growth through underground networks called mycorrhizae. Some also help store carbon in the soil, playing a role in climate regulation.\nToday's image features the amethyst laccaria. Also known as the amethyst deceiver, its bright purple colour is dazzling when young, but it fades with age and weathering, making it tricky to identify. Despite its delicate, ever-changing appearance, this jewel-toned fungus is edible and plays a vital role in the ecosystem. The species is widely found across temperate regions of Europe, Asia and North America, appearing from June to December. It typically grows alone or in small groups beneath both deciduous and coniferous trees, forming mycorrhizal associations. While it can partner with many hosts, it shows a particular preference for trees of the Fagales order, especially beech.",

With its tufted ears and a piercing gaze, this feline is the largest of the four lynx species. Stretching over a metre in length and standing as tall as 75 centimetres at the shoulder, the Eurasian lynx is built for power and precision. Its padded paws aren't just for sneaking; they act like snowshoes, spreading its weight so it can chase down prey in deep winter drifts. Mostly a nocturnal hunter, it spends its days tucked away in thickets or rocky dens, venturing out under the cover of darkness to stalk deer, hares and squirrels.\nThe lynx lives a solitary life. Males and females carve out their own territories, marking them with scratches and scent—like secret notes left in the forest. Their elusive nature did not protect them from humans: during the 1970s and '80s, thousands of lynx pelts were exported from Russia and China, pushing populations toward dangerous lows. Though fur trade restrictions have eased the pressure, poaching, habitat loss and shrinking prey numbers still pose threats today.",

In the Upper Peninsula, humans have left their traces for millennia: Indigenous Algonquian-speaking peoples were followed by French and British explorers, and waves of Finnish, Swedish and French-Canadian immigrants settled there during the 19th-century mining and logging booms. Today, this sparsely populated region hosts barely 3% of Michigan's residents, cradling its forests and waterfalls in near-natural serenity.\nReaching the falls requires a moderately challenging hike along winding paths lined with towering pines and maples, their shade cooling the ferns and wildflowers below. Red squirrels dart, white-tailed deer move silently and the calls of loons and pileated woodpeckers echo through the Hiawatha National Forest. At the trail's end, the 5.5-metre waterfall spills into a clear pool, transformed by seasonal shifts: summer light flickers across the water, autumn sets the canopy ablaze and winter drapes ice over rocks in glistening formations. At Rock River Falls, each visit offers a fresh sensory journey through the wild soul of northern Michigan.",

Established in 2011 by the Archaeological Institute of America (AIA), it's celebrated worldwide through events, tours and hands-on excavations.\nSome sites, like the one shown here, blend seamlessly into their surroundings: at first glance, Silbury Hill in Wiltshire, England, may seem like a simple slope in the countryside. However, it conceals a 4,500-year-old Neolithic enigma. Starting around 2400 BCE, chalk was locally quarried, transported and compacted by hand, layer by layer, over generations. The result is the tallest prehistoric mound in Europe, built entirely by human effort, rising to over 39 metres.\nWas it a ceremonial site, a cosmic marker, a symbol of community? Its original purpose remains elusive and for archaeology, the questions can be as valuable as the answers. Where written records fail, the land tells its story. Silbury Hill preserves these tales, reminding us why studying our past matters: it rewrites what we thought we knew, amplifies silenced voices and shows us that history is never finished.",

Today's image captures that moment: branches heavy with ripe fruit, ready for harvest.\nThis land takes its apples seriously. The state apple, the Honeycrisp, now a world favourite, was born in the orchards of the University of Minnesota, where scientists have been cultivating apples for over a century. Throughout the fall, families flock to orchards not only for the fruit but also for hayrides, cider pressing and the yearly ritual of choosing the perfect apple right from the tree.\nBehind the simple joy lies rigorous cultivation science: here, apple breeding has shaped varieties tough enough for harsh winters and sweet enough to rival any grown elsewhere.

International Sloth Day honours these unhurried creatures and reminds us that life doesn't always need to be rushed. Sloths are tree-dwelling mammals native to Central and South America. Their deliberate movements conserve energy, avoid predators and even allow algae to grow on their fur, creating green camouflage among the canopy. Hoffmann's two-toed sloth, pictured here, is a prime example of the slow-paced lifestyle typical of all sloths. It spends most of its time in the trees, occasionally descending to the ground to move to a new one.\nBeyond their charm, sloths play a crucial role in tropical forests. Their presence signals a healthy ecosystem and protecting their habitats benefits various other species, including frogs and birds. Yet these gentle creatures face growing threats due to rainforest degradation. Organisations like the Sloth Conservation Foundation are working tirelessly to develop initiatives to preserve their habitats, ensuring that future generations can continue to marvel at these slow-moving icons of nature.",

It commemorates Prince Rama's victorious return to the kingdom of Ayodhya after defeating the demon king Ravana. The festival also honours the goddess Lakshmi, who is believed to bring wealth and well-being into homes, while some communities worship the goddess Kali. During Diwali, families clean and decorate their homes, exchange sweets and gather for prayers, creating an atmosphere of joy. Central to the celebration are diyas, small oil lamps whose glowing flames symbolise light overcoming darkness and the promise of new beginnings.\nOne of the most striking places to witness this tradition is Harmandir Sahib, also known as the Golden Temple, in Amritsar, India. A sacred site in Sikhism, it is open to people from all faiths and walks of life. During Diwali, the temple glows with countless diyas and golden lights reflecting in the holy pool, creating a magical scene. The spirit of Diwali extends far beyond India. In the UK, cities such as Leicester and London light up with street processions, fireworks and community gatherings filled with food, music and dance. Did you know Leicester's celebrations are widely considered the largest outside of India?

History found a use for them, too. The Belogradchik Fortress, first built by the Romans and later reinforced by Ottomans, leans on the rocks as natural defence. Why build walls when the mountain has already done the heavy lifting? Visitors today come to hike, climb and photograph the unusual shapes, but they often leave with something extra: stories.

But every October 23, the species steps into the spotlight on International Day of the Snow Leopard, a day set aside to protect this elusive predator and its rugged home.\nSnow leopards roam high-altitude ranges across 12 Asian countries, from Afghanistan to China. Their thick coats and long tails are built for survival in freezing, rocky terrain. Yet even these stealthy cats can't hide from threats like poaching, shrinking habitats and climate change. With fewer than 7,000 left in the wild, conservation is a necessity. The image of a snow leopard mother sheltering her cubs in the rocky cliffs of the Cold Desert Biosphere Reserve in India illustrates what's at stake. That's why governments, conservation groups and local communities team up to safeguard both the animals and their ecosystems. After all, saving snow leopards also protects water sources and biodiversity for millions of people living downstream: they act as keystone species in their alpine environment, maintaining the ecological balance through predation on herbivores. That prevents overgrazing and protects vegetation that helps retain snowmelt and maintain watershed health.",

Over the years, guests and crew have spoken of echoes in empty corridors, footsteps reverberating on metal floors and the laughter of a child near the deserted pool. Ghost tours highlight these eerie stories, though historians note that deaths aboard were due to natural causes, with no murders ever recorded.

One moment it's 2 a.m., the next it's 1 a.m. again.\nBST was first introduced during World War I to save energy by making better use of daylight. Every spring, the country 'springs forward' an hour, and every autumn, it 'falls back.' The result? Longer summer evenings for strolls, cricket matches and barbecues—and shorter winter days when twilight seems to arrive before tea.\nHowever, debates still continue over whether to keep changing the clocks. Critics argue the switch disrupts body clocks and brings darker afternoons too soon, while supporters highlight safety and energy-saving benefits. For now, tradition ticks on. Whether you call it 'falling back' or just an extra hour in bed, the end of BST is a reminder that winter is on the clock's horizon. So don't forget to reset your watches.",

Observers have seen them pulling grubs from dung heaps and even forcing Verreaux's eagle-owls from their nests. Often seen in pairs or small groups, they build large stick nests on cliffs or tall trees, laying three to five bluish-green eggs. Their calls range from deep croaks to wheezy notes, and rare instances of mimicry have been recorded. Their plumage gleams purple in sunlight, a striking figure of the African highlands.

According to local accounts, the sorrowful White Lady drifts through the courtyard; a monk's muffled steps echo from behind the walls that sealed him in; and the playful laughter of unseen children carries through the corridors. Reports of flickering lights, sudden chills and disembodied voices heighten the unease. On this Halloween, Bran Castle rises beyond the stones that shape it. Here, memory twists into myth, and the line between reality and the supernatural grows thrillingly thin.",
