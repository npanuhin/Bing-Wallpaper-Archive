		"description": "Today's homepage takes us to Jutland, Denmark, where the arrival of spring showcases the green hues of the European beech, a national symbol of this northern land. The young leaves of these budding trees are significant to the Danish people, as they are harvested from April to May and used in cooking—particularly in salads. In the past, Europeans would often use the smooth bark of beech trees for writings texts. In fact, in the modern Dutch language, the term for 'book' directly translates as 'beech tree.' As the sun shines through the forest canopy, wild anemones brighten up the woodland with their white petals. These blooms, representing delicate beauty and sincerity, have even starred in masterpieces by artists such as Monet and Vincent van Gogh.",

The city started life as Pons Aelius, a Roman settlement. It was on this site that the Norman fortress that gave the city its name was built. During the Middle Ages, the city was an important trading power, while during Victorian age, its shipbuilding and engineering works made Newcastle a vital part of the Industrial Revolution.\nFast forward to the present day, and you'll find a city reborn, evident in this picture of the redeveloped Gateshead Quayside. This once-industrial heartland now pulsates with cultural life. Its once-smoky skyline replaced by the gleaming curves of The Sage Gateshead and the engineering marvel of the Millennium Bridge, nicknamed 'the Winking Eye' for its design. With its rich history, vibrant culture and warm Geordie hospitality, Newcastle Upon Tyne is a city waiting to be explored.",

With their iron-coated orange incisors, beavers fell trees, diligently constructing not just homes but habitats. Their dams create life-sustaining wetlands for countless species. Meanwhile, their lodges are masterpieces of security and comfort, the entrance strategically submerged to deter predators and provide privacy. The rodents have no trouble getting in, as they can hold their breath for up to 15 minutes. So, 'woodn't' it be nice to give a shout-out to these creatures on International Beaver Day?",

The castle served as a focal point in the tug-of-war between the Normans and the native Welsh princes, witnessing numerous battles and sieges.

These sandstone balls—a phenomenon known as concretions—formed over millions of years as sedimentary layers built up around a central core of sand and stone held together by mineral cements. Erosion gradually wore away the outer layers to expose the spherical shapes we see today. This created a fascinating spectacle that only appears at low tide. Concretions are rare and there has been plenty of wild speculation about where they come from, with some believing them to be extraterrestrial debris while others wondering if they are dinosaur fossils. The answer, however, is quite simple: it is the forces of nature at play.",

A year later, the first Earth Day event was held. Now, it has grown into an annual event with more than a billion people in over 193 countries taking part.\nThis year, the campaign's focus is on plastics, which are a particularly serious form of pollution on land and in the oceans. Many species—including this green sea turtle—eat the plastic waste they find in the ocean, mistaking it for food. These same plastics pose an entanglement risk and can also break down to become microplastics. Every year some 25 million tonnes of plastic enter aquatic ecosystems.
