		"description": "Today, we're visiting Kilchurn Castle, one of Scotland's historic landmarks, in the west of the country. Built in the mid-15th century by Sir Colin Campbell, the fortress sits on the northeastern shore of Loch Awe, the longest loch in Scotland, stretching approximately 25 kilometres. The Campbells of Glenorchy, a powerful clan, made Kilchurn their base for generations, adding to the original structure over time. From its strategic location, the castle controlled access to the Highlands, making it an essential stronghold in Scottish conflicts. In the 17th century, Kilchurn took a more defensive role, being converted into a barracks during the Jacobite uprisings. But as fate would have it, Kilchurn wasn't destined to stay battle-ready forever. By the 1700s, it was abandoned and began its slow crumble into the ruin you see today. Even though it's no longer a fortress for soldiers, its craggy remains still inspire awe and admiration.",

		"description": "Windswept cliffs, rugged beauty and dramatic ocean views—welcome to Land's End in Cornwall, England. Since ancient Greek times, when it was known as 'Belerion' or 'Place of the Sun' or in Arthurian legends about the lost land of Lyonesse, Land's End has always been a place of fascination. Land's End is the most south-westerly point on mainland Britain. It is famous for being the starting point or end of charity races which run the length of the island of Great Britain from Land's End to John O'Groats at Britain's north-easterly tip.\nThe first thing you'll notice about Land's End is the cliffs towering above the crashing waves. The sea carved these granite walls over millennia, creating a striking coastline in the United Kingdom. These cliffs are part of the South West Coast Path, a 163,169-hectare trail popular among hikers that runs from Minehead in Somerset to Poole in Dorset. The Cornish Coastal Path, featured in today's image, is a section of this trail, and snow here is a rare occurrence because of Cornwall's mild coastal climate and proximity to the Atlantic Ocean. So, whether you're here to hike, relax or just stand at the frozen edge, Land's End is a memorable cliffhanger.",

These sandstone balls—a phenomenon known as concretions—formed over millions of years as sedimentary layers built up around a central core of sand and stone held together by mineral cements. Erosion gradually wore away the outer layers to expose the spherical shapes we see today. This created a fascinating spectacle that only appears at low tide. Concretions are rare, and there has been plenty of wild speculation about where they come from, with some believing them to be extraterrestrial debris while others wondering if they are dinosaur fossils.

		"description": "In the vast expanse of the world's oceans, the green turtle is the largest of the hard-shelled sea turtles. They are herbivores, with a diet consisting of seagrasses and algae. It's this plant-based feast that lends a greenish hue to their fat, giving them their name. This globetrotter is found predominantly across the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, but can also be spotted in the Indian Ocean. It has an average lifespan of 60 years. However, beneath the surface lies a troubling truth—the green sea turtle's once-thriving populations have plummeted by an alarming 90 percent over the past 50 years due to pollution and climate change. They are at the precipice of endangerment, and there is a need for conservation efforts to safeguard their future now more than ever. So, whether you're planting trees, cleaning up beaches or simply spreading the word, let's remember to promote sustainable living. After all, there's no planet B!",

They are social animals which gather in small colonies for foraging, hunting and protection.

When observed from above, these round dwellings present an image of giant tyres or reels lying on their sides, with light walls, dark roofs and spacious interiors.\nHistorically, these buildings were communal living spaces and defensive zones for Hakka clans. The structures exemplified principles of equality and unity, with uniformly sized and shaped family areas, fostering a sense of community. In 2008, UNESCO recognised 46 Fujian Tulou sites as World Heritage Sites for their unique building tradition.

From colossal stalactite formations hanging like chandeliers to stalagmite structures reaching for the ceiling, every nook and cranny is a masterpiece crafted over millions of years. This UNESCO World Heritage Site also organises events like bat flight viewings, which allow visitors to watch thousands of bats as they swoop in and out of the cavern. So, are you ready to explore the depths?",

Thanks to the construction of the Genoa–La Spezia rail line in the 19th century, the village became more accessible by land. The cobblestone streets and absence of cars make it ideal for walking around. While here, you might want to visit the Chapel of Santa Marta and the Sanctuary of Madonna di Reggio.

These majestic creatures, with their pink plumage, which is a result of the carotenoid pigments of their diet, are a true emblem of the region. They feed on Artemia salina shrimp, which enriches their plumage with a characteristic pink hue. Their beak allows them to filter water to feed themselves, a fascinating sight to see! The reserve is home to flamingos all year round, but summer is the ideal time to see them in greater numbers. Imagine yourself walking the trails, surrounded by the song of birds and the graceful flight of flamingos. It’s an experience not to be missed! So, are you ready for a colourful adventure?",

These gargantuan water bodies, after all, teem with wonders, from the tiniest plankton to the grandest whales like the humpbacks we see here. Weighing as much as 40 metric tonnes and reaching sizes up to 17 metres, humpback whales typically feed in waters around the poles, travelling to tropical areas to breed and give birth. Their songs, ethereal and captivating, resonate through the water, travelling vast distances and enchanting all who hear them. It's believed to be a means of communication that binds humpback whales together in the vastness of the ocean.\nUnfortunately, oceans face many threats, including rising sea temperatures thanks to global warming, plastic pollution and ocean acidification, which threatens many marine species.

It flourished culturally during the Edo period (1603–1867) and became a major industrial centre after the Meiji Restoration in 1868, which restored imperial rule to Japan.\nKnown as the 'Nation's Kitchen,' Osaka boasts a culinary scene that tantalises taste buds with dishes like takoyaki, a ball-shaped fried cake stuffed with chopped octopus and okonomiyaki, a savoury pancake loaded with cabbage, meat and various toppings. But the city's charm isn't just in its gastronomic delights. Step into the past's embrace at Osaka Castle, a majestic relic of Japan's rich history and a symbol of unwavering resilience. Wander through the gardens of Shitenno-ji Temple, one of the oldest Buddhist temples in the country and an oasis of tranquility amidst the bustling city.

The square embodied the essence of the Timurid Renaissance, a period of cultural and intellectual revival, which spread throughout the Muslim world between the 14th and early 16th century CE.\nIn this grand square, citizens came together to hear royal proclamations, announced with resounding blasts from colossal copper pipes known as dzharchis. The Registan Square is encircled by three Islamic schools, namely the Ulugh Beg Madrasah, the Sher-Dor Madrasah and the Tilya-Kori Madrasah, characterised by the Islamic architectural style, which typically features elaborate repetitive patterns and ornamental forms. The influence of Registan's magnificence is seen everywhere, from the Safavid monuments of Persia to the Mughal buildings of India and Pakistan.

Filippo Brunelleschi, an Italian architect and designer, engineered its dome, which is the largest brick dome ever constructed. It was built without the support of traditional wooden frameworks; its completion in 1436 was the final stage of the cathedral's construction. It's not just the outside that dazzles; inside there are artistic treasures to discover, from Giorgio Vasari's fresco 'The Last Judgement' to Paolo Uccello's intricate clock face.\nThe cathedral complex is also home to the Baptistery, a small basilica and Giotto's Campanile, a free-standing bell tower. Step inside, and you're walking on history—every visit gives a glimpse of the past and a demonstration of human potential.",

Meerkats are highly social animals, living in tight-knit groups called mobs, which can consist of up to 30 individuals. These groups are a cooperative effort, with meerkats foraging together, grooming each other, babysitting and taking turns as sentinels to watch for predators. These critters create extensive burrows where they spend the night and retreat to escape the midday heat–meerkats love their afternoon siesta.\nClassed as 'least concern' on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species, these tiny mammals are vital for controlling insect populations in their desert habitats.

		"description": "Spot the wildlife star in today's image; it's the jaguar, the largest cat in the Americas, seen here gracing the Pantanal, Brazil. Jaguars arrived in the Americas some 2 million years ago, migrating from Eurasia through the Bering Strait. Today, they inhabit diverse habitats, from the woodlands of southwestern United States to the rainforests of northern Argentina.\nOften found near bodies of water, jaguars are excellent swimmers, ambushing prey by leaping into the water. True carnivores, jaguars rely exclusively on meat for their nutritional needs. They feed on a wide range of animals, including deer, armadillos, monkeys and lizards. Their strong teeth and jaws can also bite through turtle shells and crocodile heads. In the Brazilian Pantanal, a small population of jaguars primarily feeds on aquatic reptiles and fish. So, the next time you are on a jungle trail, keep your eyes peeled and your senses sharp – remember: every rustle of leaves could be a jaguar on the prowl!",

		"description": "The moon, Earth's only natural satellite, is a symbol for human curiosity and the relentless pursuit of knowledge. Civilisations have gazed at the sky for millennia, contemplating the origins and mysteries of the moon. The advent of space exploration transformed it into the target of numerous missions. Apollo 11, the pioneering space mission that first landed humans on the moon, was launched on July 16, 1969. It culminated in the astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin taking the first steps on the moon on July 20, 1969. Moon missions have found no signs of life, but they could be a future site for human colonisation. The discovery of water ice, especially in the dark craters at the poles, makes it more hospitable for potential settlers. So, until you can live there, keep dreaming under the same moon that has captivated humanity since time immemorial.",

Historically, this serene village played a modest role in the island's fishing industry, with traditional wooden boats, known as dhows, etching patterns across the waters. The local dhow builders offer a glimpse into an artisanal craft that has sailed through generations.\nThe boats, shaped by skilled hands using age-old techniques, represent the enduring spirit of the village. Venture deeper into the local areas and you'll find lush spice farms where the air tingles with the scent of nutmeg and black pepper. Here, traditional Swahili dishes, including Nyama Choma, a roasted meat dish, and Samaki Wa Kaupaka, fish with coconut sauce, blend spices with the bounty of the sea and land. As the sun sets, bonfires flicker into life and the island pulses with Taarab, a blend of African, Arabic and Indian music. With so much to see, Zanzibar proves that variety really is the spice of life.",

Hammocks were called 'Hamacas' and were originally woven for sleep and relaxation. Back then hammocks were made from the bark of trees, whereas now they can be made of various materials like cotton, nylon and canvas. They come in different shapes and sizes, like Nicaraguan hammocks, which are usually made of woven material with a wooden spreader bar. These sleeping swings have sailed across oceans as sailor beds, swung from the trees as forest dwellers' bedrooms, and nowadays, add a touch of chill to hip outdoor retreats. They have health benefits, too; gentle rocking can improve your sleep and even relieve stress. So go ahead, jump into a hammock and let it gently sway your worries away for a while.",

As well as being a popular stop for pilgrims on their way to Rome, the town prospered thanks to its trade in local Vernaccia wine and in saffron, which is grown in the nearby hills. However, when the Black Death struck in 1348, half the population was lost, slowing the town's development and preserving its medieval character to this day.\nSan Gimignano's most recognisable feature is its skyline, made up of 14 towers. These impressive structures were the result of a rivalry between two families, each competing to build the tallest tower-house. By the end of the medieval period, there were 72 towers in the town, although because of wars, other catastrophes and building projects, many were lost. Today, the tallest tower still standing is the Torre Grossa—'big tower' in Italian.

Spotted owlets are a remarkably resilient species that flourish in environments such as semi-deserts, rocky areas, forests, farmlands and urban areas.

Archaeological studies of pottery found at Sacsayhuamán suggest that the hilltop was first occupied around 900 CE. The Quechua word Sacsayhuamán means 'the place where the hawk is satisfied.' The citadel's walls, which extended over 30 metres, were built in the 15th century CE. The boulders used to make them were carved and placed without mortar. After the Inca Empire was defeated at a battle here in 1536, Sacsayhuamán was dismantled by the Spanish, and the rest of the structure was covered in earth. It was rediscovered in 1934 when the site was excavated.",

Its earliest known residents were people from the Pinto culture, who lived here from 8000 to 4000 BCE. Centuries later, this land was inhabited by the native Cahuilla, Serrano and Chemehuevi peoples. The park's namesake, the Joshua tree, grows in a landscape covering 3,216 square kilometres. Despite their name, they are not really trees but rather a kind of succulent. Native to the southwest US and northern Mexico, they can grow up to 12 metres tall. Whether it's hiking through Hidden Valley, visiting the Cholla Cactus Garden or marvelling at Skull Rock, this national park has a lot to offer. By night, it becomes a stargazer's paradise, as seen in today's image. Whether you seek adventure or a moment of tranquillity, Joshua Tree awaits with open skies.",

It is home to African bush elephants, Cape buffaloes, impalas, lions, cheetahs, spotted hyenas, Masai giraffes, Grant's zebras and blue wildebeests.\nElephants live in groups that are made up of several families, which are led by an older female elephant called a matriarch. Males leave to live alone or in bachelor herds, joining females during mating. Habitat loss often brings them into closer contact with humans, which can lead to serious problems for both elephants and humans. Sadly, all three species of elephants are endangered.

During a jungle expedition, he found the entrance to a cave with a roaring underground river, which was later named Hang Sơn Đoòng or 'cave of the mountain river.' In 2009, the British Cave Research Association led an expedition to explore the site. It was then that they realised something incredible: it was the world's largest cave.\nHow large, you ask? Hang Sơn Đoòng's main passage is 5 kilometres long, 150 metres wide and 200 metres high. That's tall enough to fit a 40-storey skyscraper! Inside, there is a 60-metre calcite barrier called the 'Great Wall of Vietnam' and stalagmites stretching as tall as 80 metres. It even has its own weather system; clouds form inside the cave due to temperature differences between the cave air and the outside air. Moreover, a subterranean river links Hang Sơn Đoòng to the nearby Hang Thung cave, suggesting yet undiscovered depths. Given its fragile ecosystem, strict regulations are in place to preserve Hang Sơn Đoòng's pristine condition. Tours of the cave are limited to 1,000 visitors per year.",

At less than 10 million years old, erosion has had little geological time to smooth the edges of the mountains, hence the Tetons' jagged peaks.

The name 'Iguazu' comes from words in the regional languages Guarani or Tupi, which mean 'big water.' These series of waterfalls are formed by the Iguazu River, on the border between Argentina's Misiones province and Brazil's Paraná state. They feature a striking staircase formation, with a two-step cascade created by three layers of basalt.\nBefore these falls became the spot we know today, they had quite a journey. Spanish explorer Alvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca might have been the first European to see the falls. In 1907, businessman Domingo Ayarragaray saw the potential of this area and built a hotel and roads. The falls became such a sensation that they were designated as national parks in both countries—Argentina's Iguazu National Park in 1934 and Brazil's Iguaçu National Park in 1939. UNESCO designated these national parks World Heritage Sites in 1984 and 1986, respectively, and they were later granted Outstanding Universal Value status.",

They must surface to inhale and exhale stale air, which they do through blowholes and not their mouths. How long they can hold their breath depends on the species; some can go for 3 to 7 minutes, while others can stay submerged for up to 20 minutes. Because they must always surface, half of dolphins' brains are always active, meaning they never completely fall asleep. Despite being able to exist in an array of environments and water temperatures, dolphins are threatened by a variety of human activities, such as hunting, pollution and fishing.\nThe pod of dolphins seen in today's image was photographed near Réunion, an island in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Madagascar. A wide variety of marine wildlife can be found year-round in Réunion's deeper waters, including many types of sharks, orcas, humpback whales, sea turtles and of course, dolphins.

However, this dialect is slowly fading as younger generations adopt more standard American English. Despite its small population, Ocracoke's history, culture and natural beauty make it a fascinating destination for visitors of all ages.",

Sea otters are native to the northern and eastern coasts of the North Pacific Ocean. Weighing 14 to 45 kilograms, they're expert foragers, diving to the seabed to find food. These clever critters are smart as well as cute: they use rocks to crack open shellfish, making them one of the few animals that use tools. There used to be as many as 300,000 in the wild, but they were heavily hunted for almost two centuries, as their dense fur was highly prized. By 1911, it is thought that only around 2,000 were left. Thankfully, an international hunting ban, conservation efforts, and reintroduction programs have helped them rebound, and they are now found in about two-thirds of their historic habitat.

They grow in large colonies that originate from a single root system, making them some of the largest living organisms on Earth.\nEach tree in the colony is genetically identical. When an aspen tree is cut down or damaged, the root system remains alive, allowing new shoots to emerge and grow, which helps create a resilient network that can survive harsh conditions, including wildfires. This species quickly colonises areas that have been recently burnt down and can regenerate even after frequent fires. Aspen trees are more than just a treat for the eyes; they are an example of nature's resilience.",

Meanwhile, the interior and southern regions are blanketed in cool, damp deciduous forests, which transform into a vibrant display of autumn colours.",

		"description": "Let's take a moment to admire the vibrant plumage of the wood duck, photographed in Quebec, Canada. Wood ducks, like the one in today's image, nest in tree cavities close to water and sometime take advantage of man-made boxes. They typically breed in wooded swamps, shallow lakes, marshes, ponds and creeks throughout the eastern United States, the west coast, parts of southern Canada and Mexico's west coast. Sometimes, they nest as far as a kilometre from their water source.\nThe females use feathers and other soft materials to line their nests, which are usually elevated, offering some protection from predators like raccoons, owls and hawks. During the breeding season, from February to April, you'll find the females laying 7–15 eggs. After breeding in the eastern and western United States and southern Canada, these ducks migrate southward in the fall to avoid harsh winter conditions. By October and November, they move towards milder climates in the southeastern United States and occasionally into Mexico.",

The Royal Alcázar of Seville, in the southern region of Andalusia, stands on the site of a 10th century citadel, which was expanded over the following 200 years. When Christian forces captured the city in 1248, the Alcázar was almost totally rebuilt in the Mudejar style, which takes inspiration from the intricate patterns and decorative motifs found in Islamic architecture. Within the Alcázar, there are several courtyards lined with delicately carved columns. One of these is the Patio de las Doncellas, or Courtyard of the Maidens, pictured here today.\nIn the centre of this beautiful space is a pool, whose still waters provide reflections of not only the blue Andalucian sky above, but of the intricate latticework of the courtyard's arches. Look a little closer at these arches, and you'll see carved shells, Hands of Fatima—a symbol said to bring protection—plants and Arabic script. Behind the columns, the walls are decorated with colourful ceramic times decorated with geometric patterns. These tiles, known as 'azulejos,' are a hallmark of Andalusian decoration. Outside, there is a large garden, full of fountains and tree-lined paths—a perfect spot to cool off from the hot Spanish sun.",

It played an important role in the Goa Liberation Movement during the 1950s and 60s. It was one of the places where locals fought to end Portuguese rule and unite Goa with India.

Every July, roughly 2 million of these determined grazers, along with zebras and other herbivores, set off on a journey to the Masai Mara in Kenya in search of lush pastures and fresh water. The great migration, considered one of the seven wonders of the natural world, is a safari spectacle where survival is the prize. One of the most dramatic moments of the migration is the crossing of the Mara River. Thousands of wildebeests gather at the riverbank, aware that danger lurks beneath the surface—the crocodiles—not to mention the lions and leopards that patrol the banks.\nWhen the first wildebeest takes the plunge, it's a wild rush as the rest of the herd follows, creating a chaotic scene. Some make it across, while others become part of the food chain. As October rolls around and the rains return to the Serengeti, the herds begin their journey back south, completing the cycle once again.",

Situated about 2.5 kilometres southeast of the modern-day town of Dendera, this temple complex is considered as among the best preserved in the country. Once a thriving oasis along the Nile, it was home to thousands at its height, surrounded by a vast mudbrick wall that protected its sacred grounds. The Temple of Hathor, the crown jewel of Dendera, featured in today's image, immediately draws visitors' eyes. Its construction started around 54 BCE, under Ptolemy XII, with the majestic hypostyle hall added later during the reign of the Roman emperor Tiberius.\nThis temple doesn't have a grand colonnade or pylon gateway at its entrance. Instead, an unfinished stone wall surrounds an open courtyard with entrances leading to this massive hall. So, the complex you see today is truly a testament to centuries of history and evolution.

They have short tails and three clawed toes on each limb, which help them cling onto branches with ease. Sloths are mainly leaf eaters, although they also snack on fruits, and tree sap to keep them going. To help them break down those tough, fibrous leaves, they have a special multi-chambered stomach. With their super slow metabolism, digestion takes its sweet time, and they don't need much food each day to get by. It's not just their stomachs that move at a leisurely pace; they're so slow-moving that algae often develop on their fur, giving a greenish tint, which handily also provides them camouflage.",

Welcome to the Palazzo Zuccari, a 16th-century palace where myths seem to come to life on its façade—grotesque faces swallow up its doors and windows. Federico Zuccari, who built the palace, was well-versed in monsters. His painting of the Last Judgement in Florence Cathedral and his illustrations of Dante's Inferno are replete with mythical beings.\nThe monster door originally led to the palazzo's garden because Zuccari enjoyed making his guests experience the contrast between the scary entrance and the beautiful serenity of the garden. These days, the door leads to the Bibliotheca Hertziana, a library specialising in Italian art history, from the Middle Ages to the modern day, which has occupied the site of the garden since 1912. If you're looking for more monstrous mouths in Rome, not far from the Palazzo Zuccari is the Bocca della Verità, an ancient Roman mask.

Madame Sherri's dramatic arrivals in town, often in a chauffeur-driven Packard, draped in furs, became the talk of the locals. As her fortune declined, her 'castle' fell into disrepair and was vandalised. In 1959, she returned to find her property in ruins and never came back. A fire destroyed the house in 1963, leaving behind only the stone foundation, an iconic staircase and a large fireplace leading to a lone chimney.\nToday, the forest where her house once stood spans over 200 hectares and offers scenic hiking trails through woodlands, hemlock groves and around peaceful brooks, a picturesque setting for outdoor enthusiasts. Managed by the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests, this area was named in honour of Madame Sherri, and it also includes trails that lead to the ruins of her former estate.

Bodie was named after WS Bodey, a prospector who discovered gold but tragically died in a blizzard before seeing the town's rise. When large deposits of gold were found there, it grew to nearly 10,000 residents, with saloons, dance halls and breweries lining its streets. But as the gold ran dry, so did the town's fortunes. The mines closed, the population dwindled and by 1915, the place was abandoned. Bodie's streets are now empty, its wooden buildings frozen in decay.\nToday, Bodie is one of America's best-preserved ghost towns. Wandering through the streets, you can peer into dusty homes and storefronts and even find small artefacts like shards of china and square nails from the glory days. Legend has it that Bodie's ghosts fiercely guard the town, and those who take souvenirs risk being cursed with bad luck. If that doesn't scare you, taking items home is against the park's rules.

These animals were a key part of life for many Native American tribes, providing food, clothing and tools. Their population dwindled perilously low in the late 1800s, falling from as many as 60 million to fewer than 1,000 due to excessive hunting and disease. Enter a group of conservationists, ranchers and Native Americans who stepped in to save the species. Now, over 500,000 bison roam again, many in protected areas like Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, featured in today's image.",

The Giant's Tomb, as the hill is known in English, resembles a giant resting in the crook of the 210-kilometre-long Semois River. The name originates from a local legend about a Gallic giant, Treviso, who chose to leap off the cliffs of Rocher des Gattes rather than be captured by Roman soldiers. This vantage point, popular among hikers and road-trippers, provides a view that shifts dramatically with the seasons. During autumn, the landscape dons warm colours, as seen in today's image, making it an ideal spot for nature enthusiasts and photographers.",

Built in the mid-15th century by Sir Colin Campbell, the fortress sits on the northeastern shore of Loch Awe, the longest loch in Scotland, stretching approximately 25 kilometres. The Campbells of Glenorchy, a powerful clan, made Kilchurn their base for generations, adding to the original structure over time. From its strategic location, the castle controlled access to the Highlands, making it an essential stronghold in Scottish conflicts. In the 17th century, Kilchurn took a more defensive role, being converted into a barracks during the Jacobite uprisings. But as fate would have it, Kilchurn wasn't destined to stay battle-ready forever. By the 1700s, it was abandoned and began its slow crumble into the ruin you see today. Even though it's no longer a fortress for soldiers, its craggy remains still inspire awe and admiration.",

The concept of an 'Antarctic region' was first mentioned by Greek philosopher Aristotle around 350 BCE. Despite this early reference, it wasn't until the 19th century that humans actually laid eyes on Antarctica. It is the coldest, driest and windiest of the Earth's continents, with temperatures plunging as low as -80 degrees Celsius. Vast ice sheets and glaciers found here hold about 70% of the world's fresh water. The waters are dotted with icebergs, as seen in today's image, which drift across the Southern Ocean and gradually melt over time. Species like Emperor and Adélie penguins, along with seals, mites, roundworms and moss piglets, have made this icy habitat their permanent home.",
