		"description": "Today, we're visiting Kilchurn Castle, one of Scotland's historic landmarks, in the west of the country. Built in the mid-15th century by Sir Colin Campbell, the fortress sits on the northeastern shore of Loch Awe, the longest loch in Scotland, stretching approximately 25 kilometres. The Campbells of Glenorchy, a powerful clan, made Kilchurn their base for generations, adding to the original structure over time. From its strategic location, the castle controlled access to the Highlands, making it an essential stronghold in Scottish conflicts. In the 17th century, Kilchurn took a more defensive role, being converted into a barracks during the Jacobite uprisings. But as fate would have it, Kilchurn wasn't destined to stay battle-ready forever. By the 1700s, it was abandoned and began its slow crumble into the ruin you see today. Even though it's no longer a fortress for soldiers, its craggy remains still inspire awe and admiration.",

		"description": "New Year's Eve, also known as Old Year's Day, is celebrated around the world with revelry, fireworks and for some, religious and cultural observances. Many countries celebrate with foods symbolic of prosperity, long life and good fortune for the coming year, and many people sing Scottish folk song 'Auld Lang Syne' at the stroke of midnight to remember old friends and past experiences. The new year is often personified as a baby, a tradition that dates back to ancient Greeks, often paired with an old man who represents the previous year.\nFeatured here is the dazzling canvas of light and colour as fireworks burst over the Parliament Hill in Ottawa, Canada. Often called the 'The Hill,' it is a significant landmark in downtown Ottawa, Ontario, resting along the southern bank of the Ottawa River. This Crown land is home to Canada's Parliament, housed within a striking collection of Gothic Revival buildings designed to reflect the heritage of parliamentary democracy. Welcoming around three million visitors annually, Parliament Hill is both a hub of political activity and a cultural attraction.",

These sandstone balls—a phenomenon known as concretions—formed over millions of years as sedimentary layers built up around a central core of sand and stone held together by mineral cements. Erosion gradually wore away the outer layers to expose the spherical shapes we see today. This created a fascinating spectacle that only appears at low tide. Concretions are rare, and there has been plenty of wild speculation about where they come from, with some believing them to be extraterrestrial debris while others wondering if they are dinosaur fossils.

		"description": "In the vast expanse of the world's oceans, the green turtle is the largest of the hard-shelled sea turtles. They are herbivores, with a diet consisting of seagrasses and algae. It's this plant-based feast that lends a greenish hue to their fat, giving them their name. This globetrotter is found predominantly across the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, but can also be spotted in the Indian Ocean. It has an average lifespan of 60 years. However, beneath the surface lies a troubling truth—the green sea turtle's once-thriving populations have plummeted by an alarming 90 percent over the past 50 years due to pollution and climate change. They are at the precipice of endangerment, and there is a need for conservation efforts to safeguard their future now more than ever. So, whether you're planting trees, cleaning up beaches or simply spreading the word, let's remember to promote sustainable living. After all, there's no planet B!",

When observed from above, these round dwellings present an image of giant tyres or reels lying on their sides, with light walls, dark roofs and spacious interiors.\nHistorically, these buildings were communal living spaces and defensive zones for Hakka clans. The structures exemplified principles of equality and unity, with uniformly sized and shaped family areas, fostering a sense of community.

This UNESCO World Heritage Site also organises events like bat flight viewings, which allow visitors to watch thousands of bats as they swoop in and out of the cavern. So, are you ready to explore the depths?",

Thanks to the construction of the Genoa–La Spezia rail line in the 19th century, the village became more accessible by land. The cobblestone streets and absence of cars make it ideal for walking around. While here, you might want to visit the Chapel of Santa Marta and the Sanctuary of Madonna di Reggio.

These majestic creatures, with their pink plumage, which is a result of the carotenoid pigments of their diet, are a true emblem of the region. They feed on Artemia salina shrimp, which enriches their plumage with a characteristic pink hue. Their beak allows them to filter water to feed themselves, a fascinating sight to see! The reserve is home to flamingos all year round, but summer is the ideal time to see them in greater numbers. Imagine yourself walking the trails, surrounded by the song of birds and the graceful flight of flamingos. It’s an experience not to be missed! So, are you ready for a colourful adventure?",

These gargantuan water bodies, after all, teem with wonders, from the tiniest plankton to the grandest whales like the humpbacks we see here. Weighing as much as 40 metric tonnes and reaching sizes up to 17 metres, humpback whales typically feed in waters around the poles, travelling to tropical areas to breed and give birth. Their songs, ethereal and captivating, resonate through the water, travelling vast distances and enchanting all who hear them. It's believed to be a means of communication that binds humpback whales together in the vastness of the ocean.\nUnfortunately, oceans face many threats, including rising sea temperatures thanks to global warming, plastic pollution and ocean acidification, which threatens many marine species.

It flourished culturally during the Edo period (1603–1867) and became a major industrial centre after the Meiji Restoration in 1868, which restored imperial rule to Japan.\nKnown as the 'Nation's Kitchen,' Osaka boasts a culinary scene that tantalises taste buds with dishes like takoyaki, a ball-shaped fried cake stuffed with chopped octopus and okonomiyaki, a savoury pancake loaded with cabbage, meat and various toppings. But the city's charm isn't just in its gastronomic delights. Step into the past's embrace at Osaka Castle, a majestic relic of Japan's rich history and a symbol of unwavering resilience. Wander through the gardens of Shitenno-ji Temple, one of the oldest Buddhist temples in the country and an oasis of tranquility amidst the bustling city.

The square embodied the essence of the Timurid Renaissance, a period of cultural and intellectual revival, which spread throughout the Muslim world between the 14th and early 16th century CE.\nIn this grand square, citizens came together to hear royal proclamations, announced with resounding blasts from colossal copper pipes known as dzharchis. The Registan Square is encircled by three Islamic schools, namely the Ulugh Beg Madrasah, the Sher-Dor Madrasah and the Tilya-Kori Madrasah, characterised by the Islamic architectural style, which typically features elaborate repetitive patterns and ornamental forms. The influence of Registan's magnificence is seen everywhere, from the Safavid monuments of Persia to the Mughal buildings of India and Pakistan.

Filippo Brunelleschi, an Italian architect and designer, engineered its dome, which is the largest brick dome ever constructed. It was built without the support of traditional wooden frameworks; its completion in 1436 was the final stage of the cathedral's construction. It's not just the outside that dazzles; inside there are artistic treasures to discover, from Giorgio Vasari's fresco 'The Last Judgement' to Paolo Uccello's intricate clock face.\nThe cathedral complex is also home to the Baptistery, a small basilica and Giotto's Campanile, a free-standing bell tower. Step inside, and you're walking on history—every visit gives a glimpse of the past and a demonstration of human potential.",

Meerkats are highly social animals, living in tight-knit groups called mobs, which can consist of up to 30 individuals. These groups are a cooperative effort, with meerkats foraging together, grooming each other, babysitting and taking turns as sentinels to watch for predators. These critters create extensive burrows where they spend the night and retreat to escape the midday heat–meerkats love their afternoon siesta.\nClassed as 'least concern' on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species, these tiny mammals are vital for controlling insect populations in their desert habitats.

		"description": "Spot the wildlife star in today's image; it's the jaguar, the largest cat in the Americas, seen here gracing the Pantanal, Brazil. Jaguars arrived in the Americas some 2 million years ago, migrating from Eurasia through the Bering Strait. Today, they inhabit diverse habitats, from the woodlands of southwestern United States to the rainforests of northern Argentina.\nOften found near bodies of water, jaguars are excellent swimmers, ambushing prey by leaping into the water. True carnivores, jaguars rely exclusively on meat for their nutritional needs. They feed on a wide range of animals, including deer, armadillos, monkeys and lizards. Their strong teeth and jaws can also bite through turtle shells and crocodile heads. In the Brazilian Pantanal, a small population of jaguars primarily feeds on aquatic reptiles and fish. So, the next time you are on a jungle trail, keep your eyes peeled and your senses sharp – remember: every rustle of leaves could be a jaguar on the prowl!",

		"description": "The moon, Earth's only natural satellite, is a symbol for human curiosity and the relentless pursuit of knowledge. Civilisations have gazed at the sky for millennia, contemplating the origins and mysteries of the moon. The advent of space exploration transformed it into the target of numerous missions. Apollo 11, the pioneering space mission that first landed humans on the moon, was launched on July 16, 1969. It culminated in the astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin taking the first steps on the moon on July 20, 1969. Moon missions have found no signs of life, but they could be a future site for human colonisation. The discovery of water ice, especially in the dark craters at the poles, makes it more hospitable for potential settlers. So, until you can live there, keep dreaming under the same moon that has captivated humanity since time immemorial.",

Historically, this serene village played a modest role in the island's fishing industry, with traditional wooden boats, known as dhows, etching patterns across the waters. The local dhow builders offer a glimpse into an artisanal craft that has sailed through generations.\nThe boats, shaped by skilled hands using age-old techniques, represent the enduring spirit of the village. Venture deeper into the local areas and you'll find lush spice farms where the air tingles with the scent of nutmeg and black pepper. Here, traditional Swahili dishes, including Nyama Choma, a roasted meat dish, and Samaki Wa Kaupaka, fish with coconut sauce, blend spices with the bounty of the sea and land. As the sun sets, bonfires flicker into life and the island pulses with Taarab, a blend of African, Arabic and Indian music. With so much to see, Zanzibar proves that variety really is the spice of life.",

Hammocks were called 'Hamacas' and were originally woven for sleep and relaxation. Back then hammocks were made from the bark of trees, whereas now they can be made of various materials like cotton, nylon and canvas. They come in different shapes and sizes, like Nicaraguan hammocks, which are usually made of woven material with a wooden spreader bar. These sleeping swings have sailed across oceans as sailor beds, swung from the trees as forest dwellers' bedrooms, and nowadays, add a touch of chill to hip outdoor retreats. They have health benefits, too; gentle rocking can improve your sleep and even relieve stress. So go ahead, jump into a hammock and let it gently sway your worries away for a while.",

As well as being a popular stop for pilgrims on their way to Rome, the town prospered thanks to its trade in local Vernaccia wine and in saffron, which is grown in the nearby hills. However, when the Black Death struck in 1348, half the population was lost, slowing the town's development and preserving its medieval character to this day.\nSan Gimignano's most recognisable feature is its skyline, made up of 14 towers. These impressive structures were the result of a rivalry between two families, each competing to build the tallest tower-house. By the end of the medieval period, there were 72 towers in the town, although because of wars, other catastrophes and building projects, many were lost. Today, the tallest tower still standing is the Torre Grossa—'big tower' in Italian.

Spotted owlets are a remarkably resilient species that flourish in environments such as semi-deserts, rocky areas, forests, farmlands and urban areas.

Archaeological studies of pottery found at Sacsayhuamán suggest that the hilltop was first occupied around 900 CE. The Quechua word Sacsayhuamán means 'the place where the hawk is satisfied.' The citadel's walls, which extended over 30 metres, were built in the 15th century CE. The boulders used to make them were carved and placed without mortar. After the Inca Empire was defeated at a battle here in 1536, Sacsayhuamán was dismantled by the Spanish, and the rest of the structure was covered in earth. It was rediscovered in 1934 when the site was excavated.",

Its earliest known residents were people from the Pinto culture, who lived here from 8000 to 4000 BCE. Centuries later, this land was inhabited by the native Cahuilla, Serrano and Chemehuevi peoples. The park's namesake, the Joshua tree, grows in a landscape covering 3,216 square kilometres. Despite their name, they are not really trees but rather a kind of succulent. Native to the southwest US and northern Mexico, they can grow up to 12 metres tall. Whether it's hiking through Hidden Valley, visiting the Cholla Cactus Garden or marvelling at Skull Rock, this national park has a lot to offer. By night, it becomes a stargazer's paradise, as seen in today's image. Whether you seek adventure or a moment of tranquillity, Joshua Tree awaits with open skies.",

It is home to African bush elephants, Cape buffaloes, impalas, lions, cheetahs, spotted hyenas, Masai giraffes, Grant's zebras and blue wildebeests.\nElephants live in groups that are made up of several families, which are led by an older female elephant called a matriarch. Males leave to live alone or in bachelor herds, joining females during mating. Habitat loss often brings them into closer contact with humans, which can lead to serious problems for both elephants and humans. Sadly, all three species of elephants are endangered.

During a jungle expedition, he found the entrance to a cave with a roaring underground river, which was later named Hang Sơn Đoòng or 'cave of the mountain river.' In 2009, the British Cave Research Association led an expedition to explore the site. It was then that they realised something incredible: it was the world's largest cave.\nHow large, you ask? Hang Sơn Đoòng's main passage is 5 kilometres long, 150 metres wide and 200 metres high. That's tall enough to fit a 40-storey skyscraper! Inside, there is a 60-metre calcite barrier called the 'Great Wall of Vietnam' and stalagmites stretching as tall as 80 metres. It even has its own weather system; clouds form inside the cave due to temperature differences between the cave air and the outside air. Moreover, a subterranean river links Hang Sơn Đoòng to the nearby Hang Thung cave, suggesting yet undiscovered depths. Given its fragile ecosystem, strict regulations are in place to preserve Hang Sơn Đoòng's pristine condition. Tours of the cave are limited to 1,000 visitors per year.",

At less than 10 million years old, erosion has had little geological time to smooth the edges of the mountains, hence the Tetons' jagged peaks.

The name 'Iguazu' comes from words in the regional languages Guarani or Tupi, which mean 'big water.' These series of waterfalls are formed by the Iguazu River, on the border between Argentina's Misiones province and Brazil's Paraná state. They feature a striking staircase formation, with a two-step cascade created by three layers of basalt.\nBefore these falls became the spot we know today, they had quite a journey. Spanish explorer Alvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca might have been the first European to see the falls. In 1907, businessman Domingo Ayarragaray saw the potential of this area and built a hotel and roads. The falls became such a sensation that they were designated as national parks in both countries—Argentina's Iguazu National Park in 1934 and Brazil's Iguaçu National Park in 1939. UNESCO designated these national parks World Heritage Sites in 1984 and 1986, respectively, and they were later granted Outstanding Universal Value status.",

They must surface to inhale and exhale stale air, which they do through blowholes and not their mouths. How long they can hold their breath depends on the species; some can go for 3 to 7 minutes, while others can stay submerged for up to 20 minutes. Because they must always surface, half of dolphins' brains are always active, meaning they never completely fall asleep. Despite being able to exist in an array of environments and water temperatures, dolphins are threatened by a variety of human activities, such as hunting, pollution and fishing.\nThe pod of dolphins seen in today's image was photographed near Réunion, an island in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Madagascar. A wide variety of marine wildlife can be found year-round in Réunion's deeper waters, including many types of sharks, orcas, humpback whales, sea turtles and of course, dolphins.

However, this dialect is slowly fading as younger generations adopt more standard American English. Despite its small population, Ocracoke's history, culture and natural beauty make it a fascinating destination for visitors of all ages.",

Sea otters are native to the northern and eastern coasts of the North Pacific Ocean. Weighing 14 to 45 kilograms, they're expert foragers, diving to the seabed to find food. These clever critters are smart as well as cute: they use rocks to crack open shellfish, making them one of the few animals that use tools. There used to be as many as 300,000 in the wild, but they were heavily hunted for almost two centuries, as their dense fur was highly prized. By 1911, it is thought that only around 2,000 were left. Thankfully, an international hunting ban, conservation efforts, and reintroduction programs have helped them rebound, and they are now found in about two-thirds of their historic habitat.

They grow in large colonies that originate from a single root system, making them some of the largest living organisms on Earth.\nEach tree in the colony is genetically identical. When an aspen tree is cut down or damaged, the root system remains alive, allowing new shoots to emerge and grow, which helps create a resilient network that can survive harsh conditions, including wildfires. This species quickly colonises areas that have been recently burnt down and can regenerate even after frequent fires. Aspen trees are more than just a treat for the eyes; they are an example of nature's resilience.",

Meanwhile, the interior and southern regions are blanketed in cool, damp deciduous forests, which transform into a vibrant display of autumn colours.",

		"description": "Let's take a moment to admire the vibrant plumage of the wood duck, photographed in Quebec, Canada. Wood ducks, like the one in today's image, nest in tree cavities close to water and sometime take advantage of man-made boxes. They typically breed in wooded swamps, shallow lakes, marshes, ponds and creeks throughout the eastern United States, the west coast, parts of southern Canada and Mexico's west coast. Sometimes, they nest as far as a kilometre from their water source.\nThe females use feathers and other soft materials to line their nests, which are usually elevated, offering some protection from predators like raccoons, owls and hawks. During the breeding season, from February to April, you'll find the females laying 7–15 eggs. After breeding in the eastern and western United States and southern Canada, these ducks migrate southward in the fall to avoid harsh winter conditions. By October and November, they move towards milder climates in the southeastern United States and occasionally into Mexico.",

The Royal Alcázar of Seville, in the southern region of Andalusia, stands on the site of a 10th century citadel, which was expanded over the following 200 years. When Christian forces captured the city in 1248, the Alcázar was almost totally rebuilt in the Mudejar style, which takes inspiration from the intricate patterns and decorative motifs found in Islamic architecture. Within the Alcázar, there are several courtyards lined with delicately carved columns. One of these is the Patio de las Doncellas, or Courtyard of the Maidens, pictured here today.\nIn the centre of this beautiful space is a pool, whose still waters provide reflections of not only the blue Andalucian sky above, but of the intricate latticework of the courtyard's arches. Look a little closer at these arches, and you'll see carved shells, Hands of Fatima—a symbol said to bring protection—plants and Arabic script. Behind the columns, the walls are decorated with colourful ceramic times decorated with geometric patterns. These tiles, known as 'azulejos,' are a hallmark of Andalusian decoration. Outside, there is a large garden, full of fountains and tree-lined paths—a perfect spot to cool off from the hot Spanish sun.",

It played an important role in the Goa Liberation Movement during the 1950s and 60s. It was one of the places where locals fought to end Portuguese rule and unite Goa with India.

Every July, roughly 2 million of these determined grazers, along with zebras and other herbivores, set off on a journey to the Masai Mara in Kenya in search of lush pastures and fresh water. The great migration, considered one of the seven wonders of the natural world, is a safari spectacle where survival is the prize. One of the most dramatic moments of the migration is the crossing of the Mara River. Thousands of wildebeests gather at the riverbank, aware that danger lurks beneath the surface—the crocodiles—not to mention the lions and leopards that patrol the banks.\nWhen the first wildebeest takes the plunge, it's a wild rush as the rest of the herd follows, creating a chaotic scene. Some make it across, while others become part of the food chain. As October rolls around and the rains return to the Serengeti, the herds begin their journey back south, completing the cycle once again.",

Situated about 2.5 kilometres southeast of the modern-day town of Dendera, this temple complex is considered as among the best preserved in the country. Once a thriving oasis along the Nile, it was home to thousands at its height, surrounded by a vast mudbrick wall that protected its sacred grounds. The Temple of Hathor, the crown jewel of Dendera, featured in today's image, immediately draws visitors' eyes. Its construction started around 54 BCE, under Ptolemy XII, with the majestic hypostyle hall added later during the reign of the Roman emperor Tiberius.\nThis temple doesn't have a grand colonnade or pylon gateway at its entrance. Instead, an unfinished stone wall surrounds an open courtyard with entrances leading to this massive hall. So, the complex you see today is truly a testament to centuries of history and evolution.

They have short tails and three clawed toes on each limb, which help them cling onto branches with ease. Sloths are mainly leaf eaters, although they also snack on fruits, and tree sap to keep them going. To help them break down those tough, fibrous leaves, they have a special multi-chambered stomach. With their super slow metabolism, digestion takes its sweet time, and they don't need much food each day to get by. It's not just their stomachs that move at a leisurely pace; they're so slow-moving that algae often develop on their fur, giving a greenish tint, which handily also provides them camouflage.",

Welcome to the Palazzo Zuccari, a 16th-century palace where myths seem to come to life on its façade—grotesque faces swallow up its doors and windows. Federico Zuccari, who built the palace, was well-versed in monsters. His painting of the Last Judgement in Florence Cathedral and his illustrations of Dante's Inferno are replete with mythical beings.\nThe monster door originally led to the palazzo's garden because Zuccari enjoyed making his guests experience the contrast between the scary entrance and the beautiful serenity of the garden. These days, the door leads to the Bibliotheca Hertziana, a library specialising in Italian art history, from the Middle Ages to the modern day, which has occupied the site of the garden since 1912. If you're looking for more monstrous mouths in Rome, not far from the Palazzo Zuccari is the Bocca della Verità, an ancient Roman mask.

Madame Sherri's dramatic arrivals in town, often in a chauffeur-driven Packard, draped in furs, became the talk of the locals. As her fortune declined, her 'castle' fell into disrepair and was vandalised. In 1959, she returned to find her property in ruins and never came back. A fire destroyed the house in 1963, leaving behind only the stone foundation, an iconic staircase and a large fireplace leading to a lone chimney.\nToday, the forest where her house once stood spans over 200 hectares and offers scenic hiking trails through woodlands, hemlock groves and around peaceful brooks, a picturesque setting for outdoor enthusiasts. Managed by the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests, this area was named in honour of Madame Sherri, and it also includes trails that lead to the ruins of her former estate.

Bodie was named after WS Bodey, a prospector who discovered gold but tragically died in a blizzard before seeing the town's rise. When large deposits of gold were found there, it grew to nearly 10,000 residents, with saloons, dance halls and breweries lining its streets. But as the gold ran dry, so did the town's fortunes. The mines closed, the population dwindled and by 1915, the place was abandoned. Bodie's streets are now empty, its wooden buildings frozen in decay.\nToday, Bodie is one of America's best-preserved ghost towns. Wandering through the streets, you can peer into dusty homes and storefronts and even find small artefacts like shards of china and square nails from the glory days. Legend has it that Bodie's ghosts fiercely guard the town, and those who take souvenirs risk being cursed with bad luck. If that doesn't scare you, taking items home is against the park's rules.

These animals were a key part of life for many Native American tribes, providing food, clothing and tools. Their population dwindled perilously low in the late 1800s, falling from as many as 60 million to fewer than 1,000 due to excessive hunting and disease. Enter a group of conservationists, ranchers and Native Americans who stepped in to save the species. Now, over 500,000 bison roam again, many in protected areas like Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, featured in today's image.",

The Giant's Tomb, as the hill is known in English, resembles a giant resting in the crook of the 210-kilometre-long Semois River. The name originates from a local legend about a Gallic giant, Treviso, who chose to leap off the cliffs of Rocher des Gattes rather than be captured by Roman soldiers. This vantage point, popular among hikers and road-trippers, provides a view that shifts dramatically with the seasons. During autumn, the landscape dons warm colours, as seen in today's image, making it an ideal spot for nature enthusiasts and photographers.",

The Campbells of Glenorchy, a powerful clan, made Kilchurn their base for generations, adding to the original structure over time. From its strategic location, the castle controlled access to the Highlands, making it an essential stronghold in Scottish conflicts. In the 17th century, Kilchurn took a more defensive role, being converted into a barracks during the Jacobite uprisings. But as fate would have it, Kilchurn wasn't destined to stay battle-ready forever. By the 1700s, it was abandoned and began its slow crumble into the ruin you see today. Even though it's no longer a fortress for soldiers, its craggy remains still inspire awe and admiration.",

It's inlaid with beautifully intricate mosaic tiles that have withstood the test of time.\nBuilt on soft marshland, Ravenna faces ongoing structural challenges because the entire city is gradually sinking. This is particularly evident in the crypt, which now remains perpetually submerged under about 30 centimetres of water. But instead of battling the slow flood, Ravenna has embraced it, filling the pool with goldfish that glide between the ancient columns and above the submerged mosaics.

The Moeraki Boulders, some of which are 2 metres in diameter, have been shaped by nature over millions of years. Each boulder started as a pebble on the seabed around 65 million years ago. Over time, layers of mud and silt built up around them, cemented together by calcite. Thanks to erosion and the movement of the sea, the boulders eventually emerged.

As the gas rises, it gets trapped by the ice, creating layers of bubbles in various sizes and shapes. It's wild to think that they're flammable and chilling under your feet.

Perched on a rocky hilltop, the village seen in today's image overlooks the turquoise Zahara-El Gastor reservoir and the lush Sierra de Grazalema Natural Park, a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve since 1977. Its iconic Moorish castle ruins and the 15th-century tower reflect its history as a medieval fortress. Stroll through narrow streets lined with flower-filled balconies, visit the picturesque church of Santa María de la Mesa, or simply relax and take in the breathtaking views. Zahara is also a gateway to adventure—activities like hiking, cycling and kayaking are only a little of what the village has to offer.\nFun fact: Many people thought the name Zahara de la Sierra came from azahar, the Arabic word for citrus blossom. However, studies suggest it actually comes from sahra, which means wild or barren land, reflecting the rocky hill where the village is located. As part of Andalusia's famous Route of the White Villages, Zahara de la Sierra promises unforgettable experiences in one of Spain's most beautiful corners.",

Formed 200,000 years ago by lava flows from the Piton des Neiges, this basaltic peninsula juts majestically into the Indian Ocean. On one side lies Petite Baie, once a haven for surfers, its shores still echoing tales of a time when humans and the ocean coexisted in harmony—until shark attacks imposed a solemn stillness. On the other side is a pebble beach, where the unrelenting waves sculpt the landscape. Here, the salty spray carried by the wind and the thunder of waves crashing against cliffs serve as constant reminders of nature's raw force.\nFor fishermen, it's a rich refuge teeming with rockfish. For hikers, coastal trails offer breathtaking views. Straddling fascination and peril, the Pointe du Diable is a living testament to the geological and human history of La Réunion—a place where awe inspires deep respect for untamed nature.",

It all began in 1908 when then-US President Theodore Roosevelt designated the area as a national monument. Later in 2013, Pinnacles earned its status as a national park. This land owes its formations to an ancient volcanic eruption that occurred 23 million years ago. The fiery beginnings made towering spires, cliffs and talus caves—created by falling boulders wedged into narrow canyons. Over millennia, tectonic forces shifted the landmass northward, leaving the park far from its volcanic birthplace. Talk about a journey!\nThis place offers a variety of trails, from easy walks to challenging climbs. The High Peaks Trail, featured in today's image, tests your stamina with steep climbs and narrow passages, while Bear Gulch Reservoir provides a more relaxed stroll. Moreover, Pinnacles is home to a range of wildlife including bobcats, jackrabbits and black-tailed deer, and bird species like woodpeckers and bats, making it attractive for wildlife enthusiasts. Among the park's many treasures are once-endangered California condors, which were reintroduced here in a successful conservation effort.",

It's a marine-dwelling species and can be spotted along the Atlantic coast of the Americas, from New Jersey to the mouth of the Amazon River. On the Pacific coast, it can be spotted from British Columbia all the way to Peru, including a stop at the Galapagos Islands.\nThe brown pelican is a piscivore, meaning its diet mainly consists of fish. Dixon Lanier Merritt's limerick famously begins, 'A wonderful bird is the pelican; his bill can hold more than his belly can,' and it's spot on—its pouch can store up to three times the volume of its stomach. This versatile feature acts as a scoop, a tool for cooling off during hot weather and a feeding trough for young pelicans. The brown pelican faced near extinction twice, first due to hunting and later from the impact of pesticides like DDT.",

Neptune's Grotto is a stunning stalactite cave that sits just over half a metre above sea level. First discovered by local fishermen in the 18th century, the grotto was named after the Roman god of the sea. The entire cave complex stretches on for around 4 kilometres, although visitors can only access about 300 metres of the total. Inside, there's a labyrinth of lit pathways winding past stalactite and stalagmite formations, leading to an over 100-metres-long saltwater lake.\nNeptune's Grotto is near the town of Alghero on the northwest coast of Sardinia, the second largest island in the Mediterranean. It has been inhabited for at least 10,000 years, but its most important ancient civilisation, the Nuragic peoples, lived there from around 1800 BCE until the 2nd century CE. At this time, villages were built around nuraghes, a kind of round tower fortress. Today, there are still around 7,000 of these nuraghes across the island and they have become a symbol of Sardinia.

More than a hundred years later, the art of the Neapolitan pizza maker was recognised by UNESCO as part of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.

Tucked in the heart of Jordan's arid desert landscapes, this ancient city once thrived as the capital of the Nabataean Kingdom in the 2nd century BCE. It was also a hub of the spice trade, connecting distant regions like China, Egypt, Greece and India. The city was abandoned for around 500 years before being rediscovered in 1812, earning it the 'Lost City' moniker.\nAd-Deir, seen in today's image, dates to the 1st century CE. Its design is characterised by a combination of Hellenistic and Mesopotamian influences. Although the exact purpose of the structure is debated, it's believed to have been used as a church during the Byzantine period. Standing nearly 45 metres tall and 48 metres wide, its massive facade is carved directly into the sandstone cliffs, showcasing the Nabataeans' ingenious craftsmanship and architecture.

The geothermal valley is also home to a variety of geothermal wonders, including bubbling mud pools, steaming fumaroles and other geysers.\nThe geyser remained active until the early 20th century when an earthquake once again blocked its conduit. In 1963, following recommendations from the Geysir Committee, locals cleared the obstruction from the basin's bottom, restoring its activity. Since then, the geyser has been erupting regularly. There is science behind its eruption—magma beneath the Earth's crust heats groundwater until the pressure builds up, forcing the water explosively to the surface.

It likes to glide a few metres above the ground in open fields and grasslands, swooping down feet first to grab its prey. Owls primarily hunt at night, but this silent hunter is also active during the day and at dusk. Its daylight hunts often line up with the peak activity of small rodents called voles—its favourite meal.

The 'Burgrave Gebhard vom Stein' is first mentioned in a document of King Wenceslas I of Bohemia in 1233, presumably referring to Königstein. At that time the area belonged to the Kingdom of Bohemia. In the 16th century, the castle underwent significant expansion to become a Saxon state fortress, with the start of construction of the imposing 152.5-metre-deep castle well between 1566 and 1569 being an important milestone. It is still one of the deepest historic wells in Germany.\nDuring the Dresden May Uprising in 1849, Königstein once again offered refuge to the Saxon royal family, and after the uprising was crushed, the arrested revolutionaries were brought to the fortress's state prison. During the First and Second World Wars, the fortress also served as a large prisoner of war camp. Until 1955 it was used as a youth work centre for the rehabilitation of young offenders, before being opened as a museum and attracting many visitors. In the winter months, Königstein Fortress is transformed into a fairytale winter wonderland, with frost turning the old walls into glistening works of art. No wonder this natural gem inspired Caspar David Friedrich to paint his 'Wanderer above the Sea of Fog.'",

When it comes to food, these creatures are herbivores with simple taste. These little champs spend their summer days grazing on grasses, herbs, roots, seeds and flowers, storing up energy for their big event: a roughly nine-month hibernation party. Sometimes they eat grain, worms, insects and spiders. Beyond their hibernation habits, alpine marmots live a highly social lifestyle.

		"description": "Part engineering genius, part daredevil stunt—that's the Ribblehead Viaduct in North Yorkshire, England. This Victorian structure, also known as Batty Moss Viaduct, has been carrying trains and turning heads since the 1870s. Built by the Midland Railway, it's the longest and third tallest on the Settle–Carlisle railway line. Stretching 402 metres across the Ribble Valley, its 7.3 metre stone arches reach a height of 31.7 metres.\nConstruction of the viaduct employed more than 2,000 men who lived in nearby shantytowns; tragically, more than 100 workers lost their lives during the project. In the 1980s, British Rail proposed shutting down the line, but public outcry saved it from closure. Today, the Ribblehead Viaduct remains a symbol of resilience and a marvel of historical significance, attracting visitors from around the world.",

With its striking dark features and a knack for thriving in places others wouldn't, this British breed has turned the idiom on its head. Far from an outcast, it's the backbone of Scotland's rural life and a true champion of the hills and moors. Interestingly, the Blackface sheep didn't originate in Scotland but south of the Anglo-Scottish border. The breed's history is fascinating, and varieties such as the large-framed Perth and the medium-framed Lanark types are found across the United Kingdom. Though it's the most common breed in the region, the Blackface sheep has spread across the world. Its coarse fleece is perfect for making durable products like carpets and tweeds—definitely not your average sweater material.",

Because around early afternoon, usually between 1 and 2 PM, a soft, lingering light reflects off the snow-covered ground and the deep blue sea.

While you're there, be sure to explore Cave 20's seated Buddha idol in a meditation posture, with a standing attendant Buddha on one side. What's fascinating is that these caves blend influences from Indian, Central Asian and local Chinese Buddhist art.

They weigh around 1.5 kilograms and can grow up to 1.5 metres in length. These reptiles are the only lizards in the world that forage in the sea, diving to graze on algae growing on submerged rocks. Researchers believe that both Galápagos land iguanas and marine iguanas evolved from a common ancestor that likely rafted from Central or South America. They've adapted in remarkable ways, from flattened tails for swimming to salt glands that allow them to expel seawater by sneezing.\nTheir dark colour helps them absorb heat quickly after swimming in the cold waters. These reptiles are not very social, they are often seen sunbathing in groups to conserve heat, especially during cold nights. Visiting the Galápagos Islands is a unique chance to see marine iguanas in their natural home. Whether you're swimming with them or watching them sunbathe on the rocks, it's an experience you'll never forget.",

The name 'Tyrrell' comes from the local Wergaia word for 'sky,' a nod to the Boorong Aboriginal People's interest in astronomy. Spanning more than 18,000 hectares, Lake Tyrrell is a haven for wildlife, including Mallee reptiles, kangaroos and emus.\nIn recent years, the lake has become a tourist hotspot. People come from all over the world during the winter months, drawn by its mirror-like surface that reflects the endless Australian sky, making it the perfect photo op.

Their diet mainly consists of small fish, squid and krill. They can dive up to 50 metres depth to forage for food. In winter, they migrate north to warmer waters, sometimes reaching as far as southern Brazil. These penguins are highly social and often seen in large colonies, where they communicate with each other through their distinctive calls.

		"description": "Prepare to be amazed by the giant cuttlefish, known for its mesmerising ability to transform its appearance in the blink of an eye. This cuttlefish is found in the temperate and subtropical waters of Australia, ranging from Brisbane in Queensland and Shark Bay in Western Australia to as far south as Tasmania.\nFeatured here is a giant cuttlefish in Whyalla, South Australia. In this region, where males are significantly outnumbered, a unique gender imbalance fuels intense competition for mating rights. Often referred to as the Australian giant cuttlefish, this species holds the title of the largest of its kind on Earth. It can reach an impressive mantle length of 50 centimetres and stretches up to a total length of 1 metres when its tentacles are fully extended. Weighing over 10 kilograms, this marine heavyweight is as fascinating as it is formidable. Like all cuttlefish, this species has eight arms, two feeding tentacles, three hearts and blue blood. However, its most spectacular feature is its skin, which is equipped with chromatophores—specialised cells that allow it to change colours and patterns. Despite being colour-blind, cuttlefish have eyes equipped with photoreceptors that detect the linear polarisation of light.",

People have lived in this area for at least 10,000 years, including the Anasazi, Pueblo and Paiute Peoples. The hoodoos—tall, thin spires of rock formed by erosion—in the park inspired Paiute mythology: they believed them to be the Legend People turned to stone by the trickster Coyote. The first European Americans arrived in the area in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and some eventually settled there in the 1850s. Bryce Canyon was named after Ebenezer Bryce, who had a homestead nearby. These days, the park is famous for its hoodoos. Every year, over 2 million visitors come to marvel at these geological formations. In fact, Bryce Canyon National Park has the highest concentration of hoodoos anywhere on Earth.",

Built around the 1440s by the Stewarts of Appin, its history includes royal visits and even a drunken wager that briefly transferred ownership to Clan Campbell. Despite falling into disrepair by the 19th century, it was lovingly restored in the mid-20th century and is still privately owned today. Visitors can explore this historic site on selected guided tours during the summer.\nIts name, 'Stalker,' comes from the Gaelic 'Stalcaire,' meaning 'hunter' or 'falconer.' And while its striking appearance is certainly memorable, its fame may actually stem from another reason: Castle Stalker has captured imaginations in popular culture, appearing in 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail' and the 'Black Mirror' episode 'Loch Henry.' Does it ring a bell now? Nestled in the scenic Lynn of Lorn National Scenic Area, it's an enduring symbol of Scotland's storied past.",

They're also found in Canada—like the cub in today's image, photographed in Churchill, Manitoba. Polar bears spend over half of their time hunting for seals on the sea ice, although they usually catch just one or two for every 10 that they try to catch. Their reliance on sea ice for hunting means that they are highly vulnerable to climate change. Their fur isn't truly white; it's translucent, reflecting visible light and allowing them to blend seamlessly into their snowy environment. Sea ice is rapidly disappearing as the planet heats up, and polar bears are at risk of malnutrition and starvation as their hunting grounds vanish. Shrinking ice sheets also mean that these bears have to swim farther to find food, which depletes their energy reserves. Protecting polar bears means protecting their home—let's work together to slow the effects of climate change and safeguard their future.",

According to legend, an emperor's former wife, out of devotion, transformed into a tigress and carried Guru Padmasambhava from Tibet to Taktsang in Bhutan. There, he meditated in a cave and emerged in eight incarnations, which is why it is known as the 'Tiger's Nest.' Paro Taktsang is made up of four main temples, all connected by stairways cut into the cliff face, as well as a handful of rickety bridges. There are three main routes to reach the monastery, with the most popular path winding through a forest decorated with prayer flags.

		"description": "Some places feel almost untouched by time. In Canada, one such place sits deep in Jasper National Park, Alberta, where the 22-kilometre-long, winding Maligne Lake cuts through the mountains. It is the largest natural lake in the Canadian Rockies, where towering peaks, glacial waters and endless sky come together.\nEarly Indigenous communities, including the Dane-zaa, Nakoda and Cree, have long used the area surrounding the lake for hunting and travel, and their connection to the land continues to this day. In 1907, guide Mary Schäffer mapped the lake, bringing it to wider attention. Spirit Island, a small tree-covered island in the lake, became a well-known landmark after photographers captured its striking reflection in the water. Now, it's a favourite for paddlers, hikers and those chasing the northern lights. The best time to catch the auroras? Fall through spring, when the nights are longer and geomagnetic activity is strong. When conditions line up, the aurora borealis sweeps across the sky in shades of greens, pinks and purples, as seen in today's image. It occurs when solar particles hit the Earth's magnetic field, creating light that flickers across the atmosphere. A clear sky and a bit of patience can turn an ordinary night into something unforgettable.",

After the 1815 Battle of New Orleans, the former military plaza was renamed Jackson Square in honour of Andrew Jackson, the hero of the battle and the seventh president of the United States.\nThe square was later redesigned by architect Louis H. Pilié, who drew inspiration from the famous Place des Vosges in Paris. In the centre of the square stands a striking equestrian statue of Andrew Jackson, sculpted by Clark Mills and installed in 1856, with the Saint Louis Cathedral prominently positioned in the background.

Native to North America, these sheep are known for their distinctive curled horns, which can weigh up to 14 kilograms. Rams use their massive horns in intense headbutting contests. During these battles, males hurl themselves at each other in charges of up to 32 kilometres per hour. Ewes, on the other hand, tend to keep things more low-key, forming smaller groups with their lambs. Adapted to the desert environment, bighorn sheep can go long periods without water, relying on moisture from plants to survive.\nValley of Fire State Park, seen in today's image, is one of the best spots in Nevada, United States, to observe these desert dwellers. This park is named for its fiery red sandstone formations that seem to glow under the sun. Beyond its natural beauty, the park holds deep historical significance, with petroglyphs left by ancient Indigenous peoples.

Over time, it evolved into a residence for nobility, most notably serving as the home of Maximilien de Béthune, Duke of Sully, who was a trusted minister of King Henry IV. The castle played a significant role during the French Wars of Religion from 1562 to 1598 and has witnessed countless moments of intrigue and diplomacy. In 1940, during World War II, the castle wall was hit by shells, creating massive holes, but the framework remained intact.\nToday, after multiple restorations, the castle welcomes visitors eager to uncover its history. It also stands as an example of French Renaissance architecture. Visitors can explore the imposing towers, thick stone walls and the beautiful moat that once protected the castle from invaders.

		"description": "Don't be fooled by its tropical look, this bird has a wide range and adapts to various climates—meet the kingfisher. With over 100 species spread across the globe, kingfishers are found in a variety of habitats, from dense forests to coastal regions. Most species, like the common kingfisher, prefer freshwater environments across Europe, Asia and Africa, while others, such as the belted kingfisher, are found in North and South America. These birds are instantly recognisable by their vibrant plumage, often featuring a striking mix of blues, greens and oranges.\nTrue to their name, kingfishers are masters of the art of fishing. Perched patiently above water, they spot their prey with exceptional vision. Once a fish comes into view, they dive with precision, snatching their meal with a quick snap of their long, pointed beak. Unlike most birds, kingfishers don't build nests in trees. Instead, they dig burrows into riverbanks, creating tunnels that lead to cosy chambers where they lay their eggs. Kingfishers have been celebrated in myths and folklore for centuries. In many cultures, they are symbols of prosperity, peace and sharp intuition.",

The bridge, which spans over 120 metres across the River Liffey, was named after the Dublin-born writer Samuel Beckett.\nA striking addition to Dublin's cityscape, the bridge was designed by the renowned architect Santiago Calatrava—his second masterpiece in the area after the James Joyce Bridge further upstream. Crafted through a collaboration known as the 'Graham Hollandia Joint Venture,' this bridge is an engineering feat. Its main span is supported by 31 cable stays extending from a sleek, forward-leaning arc, resembling a harp gently resting on its side—a nod to Ireland's national symbol. Beyond its elegant design, it showcases impressive functionality: it can rotate a full 90 degrees to allow ships to glide through, because of a sophisticated mechanism hidden within the base of its towering pylon.",

		"description": "In the world of clever hunting, the black heron rules the roost. This bird thrives in shallow, open waters and at the edges of freshwater lakes and ponds. It's also commonly spotted in marshes, rice fields, seasonally flooded grasslands and along riverbanks.\nAt first glance, this feathered genius seems like any other wading bird, with its long legs, slender neck and pointed beak that aid in hunting. But when it hunts, this jet-black African species showcases an extraordinary skill—it takes the shape of an umbrella, as seen in today's image. While fishing, the heron dips its head, extends its wings around its body, and forms a shaded canopy. This clever technique is known as canopy feeding. One common theory is that small fish, seeking cover, are attracted to the shade of the heron's wings and swim right into its trap. The shade acts like polarised sunglasses, reducing glare and improving the heron's vision under the water. Additionally, the heron might also be camouflaging itself, which further intensifies the trap for the fish.",

Once a pair is formed, the female takes the lead in nest-building, crafting a sturdy little home in tree branches. After about two weeks of incubation, the chicks hatch. Both parents feed the chicks a mix of seeds and insects until they fledge in about two weeks. Outside of the breeding season, goldfinches are all about teamwork.

Construction began in 2009 and by 2012, it had officially claimed its title as Western Europe's tallest skyscraper.\nBuilt where Southwark Towers once stood, the Shard transformed the area into a hub of business, luxury and panoramic views. With 95 floors (though only 72 are habitable), the building houses offices, restaurants, the five-star Shangri-La Hotel and some of the priciest apartments in the city. Sustainability was also built into the design. The structure uses energy-efficient systems, including a combined heat and power plant, making it more than just a shimmering spectacle.",

As North America's largest rodents, they can grow up to 1 metre long, not including their distinctive flat tails. Their continuously growing teeth, with thick enamel giving them an orange hue, are essential tools for gnawing on trees—a behaviour that maintains both their dental health and their environment.\nNo wonder their strong choppers make them one of nature's best engineers. North American beavers are not just famous for their engineering skills but also for being true water dwellers. As semi-aquatic rodents, they spend most of their time swimming through streams and ponds with the help of their webbed hind feet. These skilled swimmer can hold their breath underwater for up to 15 minutes. Their thick fur, coated in an oily substance that makes it waterproof, keeps them warm even in the coldest waters. However, don't expect to spot one easily during the day, as they are mostly active at night.",

Their young, referred to as cubs or kits, are featured in today's image. They are born in an underground den, blind and helpless. Their mother keeps them safe while the father brings food. But as their eyes open and legs strengthen, the real fun begins. Sibling play is essential, shaping their hunting and social skills while keeping things entertaining. Wrestling, pouncing and even playful ambushes are all part of the training. They mimic each other's behaviours, test their boundaries and develop their cunning instincts as a team.\nRed foxes are not picky eaters—they are omnivores. While they primarily feed on small rodents, they also enjoy a variety of other foods, including birds, insects, fruits and plants.

These beauties arrived in the country in the late 16th century, brought from the Ottoman Empire. By the 17th century, they became so valuable that a single bulb could cost more than a house. This period, known as 'tulip mania', is considered one of the first recorded financial bubbles. When prices crashed in 1637, fortunes were lost, but the love for tulips remained.\nThe most famous tulip fields, like the one pictured here, are found in regions such as the Bollenstreek (Bulb Region), just outside Amsterdam. Rows of red, yellow, pink and purple stretch as far as the eye can see. Then there's Keukenhof, in Lisse, the world's most famous flower park, open only for a few weeks each spring. It showcases over seven million bulbs, including rare and exotic tulip varieties. The designs change every year, so no two visits are ever the same. If you miss the bloom, don't worry—the Netherlands keeps its tulip industry thriving year-round. The Dutch take their tulips seriously and nowhere is this more evident than at the Aalsmeer Flower Auction, the largest flower market in the world. Here, millions of flowers, including tulips, are bought and sold daily, making their way to homes across the globe.",

With its bold colours, this native South American bird isn't just about looks—it's got the moves too.\nThe Andean and Guianan cock-of-the-rock are renowned for their theatrical courtship dances, making them true head-turners of the feathered kingdom. Females are far less flashy, with brownish feathers that help them stay hidden. During the mating season, males gather in leks—noisy display arenas—where they hop, squawk and shake their heads in an effort to impress a female. She watches, picks the best dancer, mates and then flies off to build a concave, cup-shaped mud nest on a rocky surface. The female typically lays two white eggs and incubates them for 25 to 28 days, raising the chicks on her own. The Andean cock-of-the-rock thrives in the cloud forests of the Andes, favouring dense, fruit-rich areas in Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia. As a frugivore, it primarily eats fruit and helps spread seeds throughout its habitat. It occasionally consumes insects and small vertebrates.",

		"description": "Step into a world where trees touch the sky. The redwood groves of Redwood National and State Parks (RNSP) in California, United States, are home to some of the tallest trees on Earth, soaring over 110 metres high. The combined RNSP contain Redwood National Park, Del Norte Coast Redwoods State Park, Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park and Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park. Some of these redwoods were alive when the Mayans built their temples, and the Great Wall of China was under construction. Protected since 1968, the park preserves nearly half of the world's remaining old-growth redwoods.\nWalk through Stout Grove in Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park or Lady Bird Johnson Grove in Redwood National Park for a quiet stroll among the redwoods. You can also hike the Tall Trees Trail, a permit-only path where you can closely witness the tallest trees. The RNSP ecosystem is home to many animals, including Roosevelt elk, black bears, banana slugs and the endangered marbled murrelets. Ferns and moss thrive beneath the leafy canopy, while coastal fog provides essential moisture to the trees. Whether hiking beneath these towering giants or simply standing in their shadows, the experience is humbling.",

		"description": "Here's a place where the wild rules and nature moves at its own pace. Moremi Game Reserve stretches across the eastern side of Botswana's Okavango Delta, covering 500,000 hectares. Established in 1963, it became Africa's first reserve created by local people—the Batawana, a Bantu ethnic group native to Southern Africa—to protect the region's wildlife from uncontrolled hunting. The combination of permanent water and dry land makes it one of the best places in Africa to observe wildlife in its natural habitat.\nOne animal you're almost certain to spot is the impala. These medium-sized antelopes are active mainly during the day. Males fight fiercely for dominance during the breeding season or rut, locking horns in dramatic battles. After a six-month gestation period, females give birth to a single fawn. Outside the mating season, they stick together in herds—the territorial males, bachelor herds and female herds—always on the lookout for predators. When danger strikes, they freeze, only to explode into a sprint when the moment demands. They can leap up to 3 metres high, cover nearly 10 metres in a single bound and change direction mid-sprint. Whether grazing quietly or launching into a sudden dash, impalas are among Moremi's most adaptable residents.",

While the Loire Valley in France is packed with stunning châteaux (French for castles), Villandry stands apart, not for its towering turrets or medieval might, but for its gardens. Built in the 16th century by Jean le Breton, a minister to King Francis I, Villandry was always meant to impress. Unlike fortified castles built for war, it was designed for comfort, featuring large windows and an open, welcoming layout. Its gardens are arranged across terraces with distinct themes. The ornamental garden showcases geometric patterns like the one pictured here. The water garden offers a serene retreat and the vegetable garden turns everyday crops into artistic displays.\nAfter a challenging period, the dilapidated Château de Villandry was purchased in 1906 by Spanish doctor Joachim Carvallo and his wife, Ann Coleman, an heiress to an American steel empire. Their passion for history and horticulture led to a full restoration and their descendants continue to maintain the estate today. These gardens change with the seasons, ensuring that no two visits are exactly alike. Whether you have a green thumb or not, it's hard not to admire the precision at play.",

		"description": "Most ports rely on docks and cranes that extend into the shoreline. Porto Flavia in the Sulcis-Iglesiente region, however, took a completely different approach. This engineering marvel transformed a cliff into a gateway for Sardinia's ore industry. Mining in Sulcis-Iglesiente has a history dating back thousands of years, from the Phoenicians and Romans to the industrial boom in the 20th century. Lead, zinc, coal, sulphur, barium and silver were extracted from these rugged hills, but transporting them was a logistical nightmare. Ore had to be hauled by cart, loaded onto small boats and then transferred to larger ships—a slow, costly and inefficient process.\nIn 1924, Italian engineer Cesare Vecelli revolutionised ore transport in the region. He designed Porto Flavia as a system of tunnels and silos carved into a limestone cliff, allowing ore to be loaded directly onto cargo ships. The facility featured two stacked tunnel levels. The upper level could store up to 10,000 tones of ore in nine reservoirs. Gravity-fed chutes transported the ore to the lower level, where a conveyor belt loaded it directly onto waiting ships. The port, named after Vecelli's daughter, Flavia, remained in use until mining declined in the mid-20th century. Today, visitors can explore its tunnels, massive silos and the platform where ships once docked—soaking in the same sea breeze that once carried Sardinia's minerals to markets worldwide.",

It has marked time for Londoners since 1859, ringing from what is now known as the Elizabeth Tower. In 2012, officials renamed the Clock Tower as Elizabeth Tower to honour Queen Elizabeth II during her Diamond Jubilee. The clock has stopped only for maintenance and rare disruptions, such as bomb damage during World Wars I and II. Each of its four clock faces spans nearly 7 metres, with the minute hands measuring approximately 4 metres. At 96 metres tall, the tower is part of the grand Palace of Westminster, home to the UK Parliament.\nFor centuries, the Palace of Westminster has stood at the heart of British politics. Originally built by Edward the Confessor in the 11th century, the palace has hosted Parliament since the 13th century. Previously a royal residence, it remained one until a fire in 1512 forced Henry VIII to relocate. A second devastating fire in 1834 destroyed most of the medieval complex, leading to the Gothic Revival design seen today. Architect Charles Barry led the reconstruction, while his assistant, Augustus Pugin, designed the intricate details. Covering around 112,476 square metres, the palace houses the House of Commons, the House of Lords and Westminster Hall, which dates back to 1097.",

		"description": "The stunning bird, featured in today's image, is the great green macaw. Measuring around 90 centimetres in length and weighing above 1 kilogram, it is the second-heaviest macaw species and the third-heaviest parrot species in the world. This macaw species is known for its mostly green plumage, with a bold reddish forehead and soft pale blue hues on its lower back, rump and upper tail feathers. They have incredibly powerful beaks, practically built like nature’s nutcracker, which helps them open even the toughest nuts. Native to the tropical forests of Central and South America, this colourful parrot is critically endangered, with fewer than 1,000 individuals estimated in the wild. These intelligent, social birds depend heavily on old-growth forests, particularly in places like Costa Rica, where they nest in almendro trees.\nThe great green macaw is a living treasure of the tropical forests. Let's cherish and protect these magnificent birds, ensuring they continue to grace our world with their beauty and charm.",

Spanning over 54,900 hectares, this lagoon is a rich mosaic of islands, mudflats, canals and marshes and is one of the largest wetlands in the entire Mediterranean Basin. The lagoon isn't just a scenic wonder—it's a place steeped in history and innovation. Formed after the last Ice Age, it became a refuge for people fleeing invasions around the time of the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 CE. In the centuries that followed, those early settlers began building what would eventually become the iconic city of Venice.\nToday, the lagoon is still central to local life, supporting fishing, tourism and even sustainable aquaculture. It's connected to the Adriatic Sea by three inlets and is famous for 'acqua alta' or 'high water,' when tides flood parts of Venice. From ancient refuge to modern marvel, the Venetian Lagoon is a reflection of how people and nature can shape a place together.",

Surrounding the waterfall, a diverse range of wildlife—including exotic birds and small mammals—enhances the feeling of being in a pristine, untouched wilderness.\nChapada Diamantina National Park was established on September 17, 1985, covering an area of approximately 152,000 hectares. In addition to the impressive landscapes and Fumacinha, the park is home to other natural attractions, such as the Lapa Doce Cave and Pai Inácio Hill.",

This male, more colourful than the female, is easily recognisable by its long neck, bright red mask and long ridged tail. Originally from Asia, the ring-necked pheasant was introduced to France during the Middle Ages. Today, it is a common sight in rural landscapes, particularly in Normandy, where it finds refuge in hedgerows, field edges and flowering meadows. Although it is not a threatened species, its survival depends on the quality of agricultural areas. The loss of hedges, wasteland and fallow fields reduces areas where it can nest and seek shelter.",

		"description": "There is something mesmerising about cities that wear their history on their sleeves—and Dubrovnik, Croatia, is one of them. Once known as the independent Republic of Ragusa, this city was a major maritime power and trading hub from the 14th to the 19th century. Situated in southern Dalmatia along the Adriatic Sea, its success was built on diplomacy and seafaring. The Walls of Dubrovnik, built between the 13th and 17th centuries, stretch for almost 2 kilometres, with towers, forts and bastions still standing strong. The current layout of the walls follows a city plan from 1292, when Dubrovnik was rebuilt after a fire under Venetian rule.\nInside these walls is the Old City—a compact grid of polished limestone streets, baroque churches and centuries-old residences. Everything here, including the 15th-century Rector's Palace, Sponza Palace and the Church of St. Blaise, reflects the city's independent past. The Franciscan Monastery, Europe's oldest still operating pharmacy, adds another layer of charm to this vintage place. Dubrovnik might seem familiar. That's because it has represented the cities of King's Landing and Qarth in 'Game of Thrones,' putting it on the pop culture map.",

Often referred to as 'River of Grass,' the park's unique ecosystem, fed by a slow-moving river from Lake Okeechobee to Florida Bay, is a significant breeding ground for tropical wading birds. Everglades National Park is not only a national treasure but also an international one, recognised as a World Heritage Site, an International Biosphere Reserve and a Wetland of International Importance.\nThe park also plays a crucial role in water conservation and flood control, as its wetlands serve as natural filters and buffers against storms.

Flamingos feed on algae, crustaceans and tiny invertebrates packed with carotenoids—the same pigments that make carrots orange. The more they eat, the pinker they get. In other words, they're what they eat, right down to the blush. In the air, flamingos are sleek flyers, cruising long distances in a V-formation.

It's not just one landscape, it's three: the Chihuahuan Desert, the Chisos Mountains (pictured here) and the Rio Grande. Big Bend sits on the United States–Mexico border, and its history reflects that blend. Indigenous peoples, Spanish explorers, ranchers, miners and modern travellers have all left their footprints. Petroglyphs, ruins and old trails show the land's story began long before it became a park.\nBig Bend is home to over 1,200 species of plants, more than 450 species of birds and a wide variety of mammals, reptiles and amphibians.

This uninhabited green islet sits quietly just south of the town of Vila Franca do Campo. Beneath its serene surface, this gem holds a lively past. First documented in 1537, around the time when settlers from São Miguel began expanding westward, Vila Franca Islet has played many roles throughout its history. It has served as a military fort, a port, a vineyard site and even a lookout for whale-watching.\nOnce a volcanic crater, this islet is now a protected nature reserve teeming with unique marine life, including bird species like Bulwer's petrel, little egret and sooty tern. The unique shape of this tiny island, sculpted by nature, makes it truly special. At its heart lies an almost perfectly circular lagoon, linked to the sea by a narrow channel called Boquete. Since the opening faces north toward São Miguel, it shields the lagoon from ocean waves and forms a calm natural harbour with a sandy beach. It's no wonder the spot is a favourite for swimmers: from June to October, ferries run daily between the town and the islet. Access is limited to 400 visitors a day—do you want to be one of them?",

Native to open grasslands and shrublands of South America, the lesser rhea is a large, flightless bird. Known for its impressive speed and agility on land, it can reach speeds of up to 60 kmph. It is sometimes referred to as the South American ostrich, as it closely resembles a small ostrich.\nOne of its most fascinating traits is its breeding behaviour. A male lesser rhea mates with several females and leads them to a shared nest, where they lay eggs in succession before leaving and returning periodically to add more. From the moment his chicks hatch, the male lesser rhea takes full charge—guiding them through the brush, communicating with gentle whistles and sheltering them under his wings in times of danger or cold. Remarkably, he often adopts lost chicks, raising a mixed-age brood. For nearly six months, he teaches and protects them, with many staying close until maturity. The lesser rhea is a living symbol of resilience and ecological balance in South America's grasslands. Protecting them means protecting our planet.",

Welcome to the maritime forest of Cumberland Island National Seashore on the southernmost stretch of Georgia's Atlantic coast. Salt spray, sandy soil, hurricanes? The trees here stand their ground. Live oaks bend but don't break. Saw palmettos crowd the ground like leafy bodyguards, while Spanish moss hangs from branches like nature's fringe. This maritime forest is one of the best remaining examples of this rare habitat in the United States. Thanks to its national seashore status, the island has been spared from the concrete creep seen on other coastlines.\nWhat you see here is the forest as it's been for centuries—a few ruins from the days of Scottish American industrialist Thomas Carnegie and the occasional feral horses grazing through. The horses are descendants of animals left by settlers long gone and they're now unofficial mascots of the area. Alongside them, you might spot armadillos digging through the undergrowth, woodpeckers hammering tree trunks or raccoons engaging in tiny heists. Trails like the South End Trail or the Parallel Trail weave through dense foliage, sometimes giving glimpses of marshes or hidden historic sites.

These formations are made mostly of Entrada and Navajo sandstone. The park was recognised as a national monument in 1929 and was later upgraded to national park status in 1971.\nDelicate Arch, in Arches National Park, is one of the most recognisable natural arches in the American Southwest. Originally known by several other names—including 'the Chaps' and 'Salt Wash Arch'—it wasn't officially called Delicate Arch until the 1930s, after a scientific expedition described it as 'delicate-looking.'

		"description": "You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink—unless, of course, you're talking about Horse Head Rock, perched off the Sapphire Coast near Bermagui in New South Wales, Australia. This ancient formation, pictured here, seems as if nature itself has sculpted a mythical creature forever poised to drink from the sea. Estimated to be 500 million years old, the rock's uncanny resemblance to a horse bending its neck is the result of wind and wave erosion. As one of the region's oldest and most iconic landmarks, it attracts hikers, photographers and nature lovers year-round. The best views are from the elevated track between Camel Rock and Murunna Point, while the more daring can scramble around from Camel Rock Surf Beach, though only safely at low tide.\nBermagui, about 380 kilometres south of Sydney, sits under Gulaga, also known as Mount Dromedary. Gulaga is a sacred mountain for the Yuin peoples, an Australian Aboriginal group, who call it Mother Mountain. This area is also home to other highlights, like Camel Rock, Wallaga Lake, the Bermagui Blue Pool and Mimosa Rocks National Park. Wildlife is abundant too—keep an eye out for migrating whales, playful dolphins and soaring sea eagles as you explore the coastline.",

The splendid leaf frog, or splendid treefrog, is a rainforest resident with a flair for the dramatic: neon legs, sticky feet and a disappearing act. One minute it's a humble green leaf, the next it's a flash of colour mid-leap, startling predators. This frog lives high in the canopies of Central and South America, especially in Costa Rica, Panama and parts of Ecuador and Colombia.\nThis amphibian is a nocturnal ninja, spending its days snoozing on leaves and its nights foraging for insects. With vertical pupils and a golden glow, its oversized eyes help this frog spot prey in the dark. Thanks to sticky toe pads and strong limbs, it can cling to branches and leaves like a pro, even in the canopy's slippery heights. Breeding season gets creative. Females lay their eggs on leaves overhanging small pools or puddles. Once the eggs hatch, the tadpoles drop into the water below—no parental supervision required. With a dash of colour, a splash of stealth and a leap of faith, this species knows how to keep things un-frog-ettable.",

Native to the Indo-Pacific, from western Indonesia to Taiwan and the Great Barrier Reef, this species lives on the edges of coral reefs. This fish is easily distinguished by the spine extending from each cheek—hence the name.

This area has served as a natural resource for humans and animals for centuries, with the crystal-clear Rainbow River—flowing through the park—playing a major role. The gently winding waterway is fed by Rainbow Springs, one of Florida's largest springs. The water that bubbles up here comes from an almost 200,000-hectare area and eventually flows into the Withlacoochee River.\nThe Rainbow River's transparent waters are perfect for swimming and snorkelling, and they maintain a constant temperature of 22°C year-round. The park's history dates to the late 1880s, when hard rock phosphate was discovered in the area, leading to the boomtown era. This period saw the rapid growth of a small community called Juliette near the springs, driven by the phosphate mining industry. During the 1960s, the park emerged as a popular tourist destination, featuring glass-bottom boat rides, a monorail system and even a rodeo.

Once underwater, the gannet uses its wings and webbed feet to swim after fish, diving as deep as 21 metres and staying submerged for up to 30 seconds.

Yet sometimes it's the smaller creatures that grab attention—like the Thomson's gazelles featured in today's image.\nKnown as 'tommies', Thomson's gazelles are among the fastest animals in Africa, reaching speeds of up to 80 kilometres per hour. They thrive in the Mara's short grass plains, which provide a clear view of approaching predators. Though adults may seem to be grazing peacefully, their ears are always tuned to nearby movements.\nMating occurs year-round, peaking just before the rainy season. Males hold territories, waiting for females to pass through. After a five- to six-month gestation period, the female gives birth to one fawn, weighing around 2 to 3 kilograms. For the first few weeks, the small gazelle stays hidden most of the day. The mother returns briefly to nurse, minimising attention from predators. These early days are crucial as the young learn to run and blend in. Despite their delicate appearance, tommies are tough. Many join the great migration during the dry season, relying on their agility and the awareness of wildebeests and zebras to evade danger in search of greener plains.",

The international rescue effort, launched by UNESCO in the 1960s, required a monumental effort that involved moving more than 40,000 stones. Today, it's a peaceful spot surrounded by the Nile—perfect for a scenic boat ride and a journey into the past.\nTo enter the temple complex, sightseers step through a grand gateway that leads to a courtyard lined with towering columns. The main temple is dedicated to Isis, the goddess of magic, motherhood and protection and its walls are covered in carvings that tell her story. Smaller chapels and shrines tucked around the site, including ones for Osiris (the Egyptian god of the underworld and brother-husband to Isis) and Horus (the sky deity depicted with a falcon head). Visitors can explore this UNESCO World Heritage Site freely or join a guided tour. At night, a sound-and-light show brings ancient myths to life. The temple's intricate carvings and well-preserved structures provide a fascinating glimpse into Egypt's ancient history.",

		"description": "If you're looking for a scent-sational summer trip, follow your nose to the Plateau de Valensole in Provence, France. From late June to mid-July, this high plateau transforms into a purple sea of lavender. Situated more than 580 metres above sea level and spanning approximately 78,000 hectares, it is one of the largest areas in France dedicated to lavender cultivation.\nLavender has flourished in Provence for centuries. The ancient Romans brought the plant to southern France, using it for bathing, cooking and healing. The word itself comes from 'lavare', Latin for 'to wash'. By the Middle Ages, local monks were cultivating it for medicinal purposes. The real boom came in the 19th century, when the perfume industry in nearby Grasse took off. Over time, lavender fields spread across Provence, especially in high-sun, well-drained areas like Valensole. Today, 1,700 growers tend to around 25,100 hectares of these shrubs. They cultivate both traditional lavender—for perfumes and skincare—and lavandin, the longer-stemmed cousin often found in household cleaning products and air fresheners. So don't just leave it to chance—plan ahead, follow the scent trail and let your summer bloom with lavender memories.",

Tall, aligned and fast-growing, these trees are not native to the country — they came from Oceania, but took root here in the early 20th century. Eucalyptus is now one of the most planted species in the country, the basis for the production of paper, cellulose and charcoal. When well-managed, especially in already degraded areas, it can relieve pressure on native forests and favour soil recovery. However, in large areas, the continuous cultivation of eucalyptus can alter the local environment, affecting biodiversity and water dynamics.\nReforestation can seem simple, but there's more to it. Each tree poses a bigger question: how can we use the land and still protect nature? The future of Brazil's land depends on finding this balance. Even planted forests can create space for life. A forest can start with just an idea.",

Also known as the American moon moth, this striking insect—with its lime-green wings, white body and moon-like eyespots—can be found across North America. Its caterpillars are also green and are known for their impressive size, as well as their ability to emit clicking sounds and regurgitate intestinal contents as a defence mechanism against predators.\nThe luna moth's life cycle spans about 7 to 8 weeks, beginning when a female lay 200-400 eggs, singly or in small groups, on the underside of leaves. Its life unfolds in distinct stages—around 10 days as eggs, 6-7 weeks as larvae, 2-3 weeks as pupae and about 7-10 days as adults. Adult luna moths have only vestigial mouthparts and no functioning digestive system, so they do not eat; instead, they survive solely on the energy stored during their caterpillar stage. Even though they only stick around for a short time, luna moths manage to leave a lasting impression—like a quiet reminder of how magical nature can be.",

With a diameter of about 3,474 kilometres—roughly one-quarter that of Earth—it exerts only one-sixth of our planet's gravity. This is why astronauts famously bounce when they walk on its surface. The moon's surface is mostly covered with rock and fine lunar dust, created by billions of years of impacts from meteoroids and micrometeorites. This powdery material, called regolith, gives the moon its grey, dusty appearance.\nThe last human to visit the moon reported experiencing 'lunar hay fever,' a respiratory reaction caused by inhaling the sharp, reactive particles. This surprising health hazard highlighted just how invasive and persistent moon dust can be. Do you know? In 1969, Neil Armstrong was the first to step onto the moon. With his iconic words, 'That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind,' Armstrong became the first human to walk on the moon, followed by Buzz Aldrin.",

It can be easily recognised by its thick, upright branches that can grow more than 2 metres tall. These strong, round branches look a lot like a stag's antlers, which is why it's called Staghorn coral. Scientifically named Acropora cervicornis, it is among the fastest-growing corals on Earth—serving as a central hub of biodiversity in the Western Atlantic.\nLike other members of the Acropora genus, Staghorn corals are surprisingly efficient predators. They use their tiny, stinging tentacles to capture and consume zooplankton, which are small drifting animals found in the water column. These corals are also primarily nocturnal hunters, choosing the cover of darkness to extend their delicate tentacles and begin feeding. Staghorn coral reef is home to roughly 25% of all marine species, despite covering less than 1% of the seafloor. These ecosystems not only support ocean biodiversity but also protect coastlines and drive economies through tourism and fishing.",

These compact birds are easily recognised by their short, curved bills, square tails and long wings. They are usually seen in small groups, huddled closely together on bare branches, power lines or pylons, occasionally preening one another. Agile in flight, they make aerial sallies to catch insects mid-air—sometimes holding the prey in their feet, tearing it apart with their beaks. While they typically feed on the wing, they may also return to a perch—or even land on the ground—to consume their catch or visit birdbaths.",

The water that remains trapped in sandstone and reef depressions creates habitats for everything from sea hares to brittle stars.\nOver time, the tide pools are created through the process of erosion—waves hit the sandstone and limestone coastlines until they carve out pockets that hold water. Twice a day, as the tide moves in and out, these spaces flood and drain, challenging the survival skills of everything inside. Winter months, when tides are lowest during daylight hours, are ideal for observing them. And remember, these pools are protected under California's Marine Life Protection Act. Enjoy the view, observe those residing in the depressions, take pictures, but don't disturb anything. It is marine biology in motion and it's free.",

		"description": "It looks like this small creature is playing a game, right? But when a baby ring-tailed lemur wraps its tail around or gives it a tug, it's actually working on crucial skills. The infants spend their early weeks hanging tight to their mom, first clinging to her belly and later to her back. As they grow, they separate from their mom and tail-chasing becomes part of how they learn balance, coordination and group play. These primates use their long tails for communication as well. Raised like flags during group movement, the tails help them stick together in open terrain. Loud, rhythmic calls, scent markings and 'stink fights' between males add to the social drama.\nRing-tailed lemurs are found only in southern and southwestern Madagascar, where they live in dry forests, spiny thickets and rocky outcrops. They live in female-dominated groups, sometimes up to 30 individuals. Habitat loss due to slash-and-burn agriculture and charcoal production has pushed them into vulnerable status, despite being one of the most studied lemurs.",

But in its centre rests an unusual sculpture: gigantic steel letters intertwined in a knot. Created by artist Sérgio Cardoso in 2003, the work arrived before the roundabout itself—traffic circled around it before any road planning. Made of stainless steel and about 4 metres tall, its original name, 'Diálogo,' never stuck. For residents, it was always 'Bola das Letras.' And so, it remained: a spontaneous nickname, a reference that slipped out of control and became part of the urban landscape. Today, few remember the official title—or even the name of the roundabout.\nWithout a plaque, without a caption, the sculpture remains enigmatic. It doesn't form sentences. It doesn't point in a direction. Yet it has become a visual landmark and a living metaphor: a tangle of symbols in the heart of the city, challenging those who seek meaning where there is only suggestion.",

These rays aren't aggressive, but they're not defenceless either.\nThese creatures are often seen alone, but when they travel in groups, it's a show worth watching. Dozens can glide together in perfect sync, like the ones photographed near San Cristóbal Island in Ecuador.

These dune-like hills were shaped over thousands of years—not by rivers or tectonic shifts, but by windblown dust and fine silt, known as 'loess ', carried from the arid Southwest. During the Ice Ages, glaciers from Canada ground rock into fine 'glacial flour', which flowed into the prehistoric Glacial Lake Missoula. When ice dams broke, floods swept across eastern Washington, leaving behind layers of silt. Prevailing winds later carried that dust to this region, settling it into the hills we see today.",

		"description": "If fairy tales had architects, they might've come up with something like Alberobello in Italy. But instead of magic wands, it was limestone, mortar-free masonry and—according to some theories—a bit of tax evasion that built this town's signature homes: the trulli. These are whitewashed stone houses topped with dry-stacked limestone roofs shaped like upside-down ice cream cones. It's an ancient building technique and in this case, a clever one. Back in the 14th century, locals were reportedly trying to avoid property taxes by constructing homes that could be quickly dismantled when the king's tax collector came around.\nAlberobello's trulli aren't hidden one-offs. Entire districts—like Rione Monti and Aia Piccola—are packed with these quirky structures. Some are still lived in, while others have been transformed into cafés, souvenir shops and pint-sized museums. You'll even find a church built in trullo style. In 1996, UNESCO gave the trulli of Alberobello the heritage stamp of approval. It's not every day that a loophole becomes a landmark.",

Also called Leitisvatn, this lake on the island of Vágar appears to float far above the ocean. In reality, it sits less than 30 metres above sea level. As the largest lake in the Faroes, Sørvágsvatn has a surface area of about 3.4 square kilometres and feeds the Bøsdalafossur waterfall, where its waters pour dramatically into the sea.\nSørvágsvatn reminds us why lakes are so vital. They not only provide recreation but also store freshwater, regulate local climates and support biodiversity. Yet today, many are under threat. Pollution, overuse, climate change and fluctuating water levels are placing increasing pressure on these fragile ecosystems. So, the next time you look at a map, think of lakes not just as dots of blue but as living, breathing parts of our world that deserve our care and attention.",

		"description": "Meet the great egret, also known as the great white egret. Found in the Americas, Asia, Africa and parts of Europe, these birds are often seen wading through wetlands, tidal flats and quiet streams. Patient and precise, they stand motionless for minutes, waiting for just the right moment to deliver a lightning-fast strike. Fish are their main prey, but they also eat frogs, reptiles and even small mammals.\nIn the late 1800s, the great egret's beautiful plumes became a must-have in women's fashion across North America, driving their population down by an estimated 95%. The killing might have continued if not for two Boston socialites, Harriet Hemenway and Minna Hall, who led a boycott of the feather trade. Their activism helped launch the National Audubon Society. It also pushed the US Congress to pass the Weeks–McLean Law in 1913, which banned market hunting and protected migratory birds. Today, the great egret is a powerful conservation success story thanks to more than a century of legal protection and public action. It also serves as the Audubon Society's symbol.",

Once the site of a bustling market square known as the Plaza del Arrabal, this historic space has witnessed the city's transformation over the centuries. The shift began in 1561, when the plaza came under Madrid's jurisdiction after the royal court moved from Toledo. Inspired by a vision of order and grandeur, King Philip II reimagined the square—though construction did not actually begin until 1617, under the reign of Philip III.\nFeaturing a rectangular layout, the plaza is framed by three-storey buildings with 237 inward-facing balconies. It has ten entrances, nine of which are gated. At its centre stands the equestrian statue of Philip III, added in 1848. Over the years, the square has hosted everything from local festivities and bullfights to beatifications and royal ceremonies. Today, it remains a vibrant gathering place, featuring Easter drum parades, outdoor concerts, an annual Christmas market and a Sunday morning market for stamp and coin collectors.",

Their mouths can stretch over a metre wide, but they feed by suction, not biting. Each has a unique pattern of white spots and stripes—no two alike—used by researchers to track individuals. Their breeding patterns remain largely a mystery, but they are ovoviviparous, meaning pups hatch inside the mother before being born alive. Their story reminds us how much ocean life remains a mystery and how vital it is to protect what we already know is at risk.",

Before Gering became a town in 1887 and decades before Nebraska achieved statehood in 1867, these sandstone and siltstone formations were already guiding thousands along the Oregon, California and Mormon Trails. Scotts Bluff National Monument is named after Hiram Scott, a fur trader with the Rocky Mountain Fur Company who died under mysterious circumstances nearby in the 1820s.\nToday, the nearly-1,215-hectare monument includes two main bluffs—Scotts Bluff to the north and South Bluff. It also protects five prominent outcroppings: Dome Rock, Eagle Rock, Crown Rock, Saddle Rock and Sentinel Rock. At ground level, mule deer graze alongside black-tailed prairie dogs, while coyotes prowl and short grasses ripple in the wind. Higher up, the landscape shifts, spiny yuccas and hardy shrubs cling to rocky slopes and bighorn sheep navigate the cliffs with ease. Though the waggons are long gone, Scotts Bluff still stands as a guide through both history and terrain.",

But this scene from Deadvlei, in Namibia's Namib-Naukluft Park, is entirely natural. The name 'Deadvlei' means 'dead marsh'—a remnant of the wetland that once filled this basin.\nCenturies ago, a river sustained this patch of life. Then the dunes shifted, cutting off the flow. The camel thorn trees that once grew here didn't collapse or vanish. The extreme aridity and high salt content in the soil stopped the natural process in its tracks. Under those conditions, even decay gave up. The trees were embalmed by the desert—sun-dried, rigid and rooted in place for up to 900 years. Deadvlei's power lies not only in its stark beauty but in its quiet defiance. These trees, no longer alive yet not fully gone, remain like permanent witnesses in a place that chose stillness over erasure.",

While it prefers the shelter of forests, this agile creature easily adapts to gardens and parks. It builds its nest, called a drey, high in the fork of a tree using twigs to form a domed structure about 25 to 30 centimetres wide. The female featured here is gathering moss—one of several soft materials, along with bark, leaves and grass, that line the nest and turn it into a snug, well-insulated retreat. These rodents may also take over tree hollows or abandoned woodpecker holes when available.\nTypically solitary and quite shy, they rarely share food or space. However, during colder months, it's not uncommon for several individuals to use the same nest to stay warm. Their social organisation is shaped by dominance hierarchies, both within and between the sexes. While males aren't always dominant over females, the top-ranking individuals tend to be older and larger. Dominant males also tend to occupy larger home ranges than subordinate males or most females.",

		"description": "'Make hay while the sun shines' may sound like an old proverb, but in farming it's a practical truth. Hay baling plays a crucial role in agriculture worldwide. It involves cutting, drying and packaging grasses to feed livestock during the colder months. The process depends heavily on the weather: the grass must be dry before it's baled, or it risks moulding. Farmers must act quickly once a dry spell arrives, making it a seasonal race.\nThe practice of baling dates back centuries, evolving from horse-powered balers of the 1800s to today's high-powered machines that can wrap and eject bales in minutes. In North Yorkshire, England—where today's image was taken—the rolling lowlands and upland meadows create ideal conditions for growing and curing high-quality hay. With grazing livestock such as sheep and cattle making up around 40% of farm holdings, hay is a key feed resource supporting the region's rural economy. So, when you see golden fields dotted with neat, sunlit rolls, you're witnessing the result of careful timing and hard work. It's a tradition that remains as important today as ever.",

The black-winged stilt, with its long, slender red legs, moves with quiet elegance through the shallows. Their presence sometimes evokes a quiet intimacy—two birds drifting close, their movements mirroring one another in a delicate choreography, as if sharing a secret only the wetlands can hear. They hunt with quiet precision, gently picking insects, larvae and tiny crustaceans from the water's surface. Each movement reveals a subtle mastery of their environment, shaped by patience and instinct.\nBut these birds are more than graceful wanderers. Nesting on bare ground, vulnerable to rising waters and human disturbance, they are living indicators of ecological health. Their presence signals balance; their absence, a warning. To protect the stilts is to protect the fragile harmony of wetlands—those shimmering worlds where life breathes in silence. In their reflection, we see not only beauty, but the urgent need to care for the places that still hold it.",

Seen from 362 kilometres above, the Gulf Coast glows like a constellation—clusters of light scattered across the dark. But what truly makes this view possible can't be seen: the ozone layer, silently shielding everything below from the sun's ultraviolet rays. By the 1980s, that shield was thinning fast—damaged by chemicals once used in refrigeration and aerosol products. The solution? A global pact. The Montreal Protocol, signed in 1987, led to a swift phase-out of ozone-depleting substances. Today, satellites show that the hole over Antarctica is shrinking. Scientists believe it could be fully healed by mid-century.",

At this stage, his antlers are more crown than weapon—still covered in velvet. But even now, they hint at a life shaped by instinct, sparring and the quiet pull of dominance.\nMoose are the largest members of the deer family in North America and mature bulls can top 680 kilograms and reach about 2 metres at the shoulder. Their antlers grow at an astonishing pace—about 2.5 centimetres a day in summer—only to be shed every winter, then regrown each spring. This young bull might not be ready to duel for territory or mates just yet, but rehearsal has already begun. He'll spar gently with others, learning how to move, how to hold his ground, how to rise in the ranks of the wild. Spotting moose in Denali is fairly common, but finding one mid-growth is something else entirely: a glimpse into the making of a giant. For now, there's no clash—just the quiet power of potential beneath Alaska's endless sky.",

The Thousand Islands is an archipelago in the St. Lawrence River, spanning the state of New York in the United States and the province of Ontario in Canada. It is made up of more than 1,800 islands. Some of these islands have fairytale castles; others are barely big enough for a hammock. There's also Just Room Enough Island, which lives up to its name with a single house and a lone tree.\nThe region is perfect for slow-paced exploration. Boat tours take you past grand estates and historic lighthouses, often stopping at landmarks like Boldt Castle and Singer Castle. Kayakers are drawn to the region's clear waters and serene coves. Thanks to a unique microclimate, local winemakers craft award-winning wines that are well worth sampling. Oh, and the dressing? Legend says a local fishing guide's wife first created it for dinner guests, including actress May Irwin, who enjoyed it so much that she asked for the recipe.

The scale is staggering: the festival grounds span about 42 hectares and host 14 main tents, each seating thousands. Each year, visitors consume around seven million litres of beer, along with mountains of pretzels, sausages and gingerbread hearts. All beer served at Oktoberfest comes from Munich breweries and meets the strict standards of the Reinheitsgebot, the German Beer Purity Law.\nBeyond the drinks and food, the sprawling fairground is its own world, filled with roller coasters, games and classic rides.

A member of the Ramphastidae family, which includes toucan barbets, it is one of more than 40 toucan species. Found from southern Mexico to northern Colombia, it spends much of its day plucking fruit with a rainbow-coloured bill about one-third of its total length. It also eats insects, eggs and small reptiles when available. The bill not only helps it eat but also keeps the toucan cool by radiating excess heat—thanks to the blood vessels running through it. This social bird often moves in small groups, chattering and gliding between treetops. With each wing measuring around 18-20 centimetres, the keel-billed toucan moults, or sheds its feathers, just once a year.\nWhen the breeding season arrives, a pair claims a tree cavity. The female lays two to four eggs and both parents share incubation duty. The chicks hatch featherless, with closed eyes and tiny, pale bills. Over the weeks, their colours emerge, and they begin taking short flights. So, if you catch a glimpse of one, remember: it's more than a pretty face—it's a smart, social and well-equipped rainforest multitasker.",

Once called Bear Lodge, the butte gained its current name during an 1875 expedition led by Colonel Richard Irving Dodge, possibly after an interpreter mistranslated a Native phrase as 'Bad God's Tower.' The missing apostrophe in its official title follows standard geographic naming conventions—hence, the signs read 'Devils Tower.' In 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt proclaimed it as the nation's first national monument.\nAs you approach Devils Tower, every curve in the road unveils a new view—whether you're arriving from the highway, winding toward the visitor centre or following the Tower Trail on foot. The site's significance stretches far deeper than its dramatic geology. For centuries, numerous tribes from the Great Plains and Black Hills, including the Arapaho, Crow and Cheyenne, have been linked to this place. Each tribe preserves oral traditions about the Tower's creation. While many of these accounts share recurring themes, the details remain unique to every community. Devils Tower continues to embody a living chronicle of geology, heritage and the ever-changing relationship between humans and the natural world.",

This fort has a circumference of about 13 kilometres and a maximum length of 5 kilometres. It is reached by a steep, zigzag ascent of just over 1 kilometre from the plains, beginning with a limestone bridge over the Gambhiri River.

With survival smarts and turbo-charged feet, this tiny rodent proves that being 'least' is no reason to squirrel away your potential. Weighing less than a deck of cards and measuring under 25 centimetres from nose to tail, this species is North America's smallest chipmunk.\nWhen it's not sprinting up logs or vanishing into leaf piles, it is stuffing its face—literally. Its expandable cheek pouches help it haul seeds, berries and insects to storage spots. Come winter, it doesn't fully hibernate. Instead, it enters a light torpor, waking every so often for a snack. Not one for group living, each least chipmunk carves out its own territory every summer, usually with a hidden burrow and a backup food cache or ten. But if a predator wanders too close, you'll hear chip-chip-chip alarms sounding off.\nDid you know that a least chipmunk's memory is so sharp that it can remember the locations of hundreds of food caches, even after a long winter nap?

It's peaceful. And then you step inside the town walls, and it gets clever.\nPienza was once a regular medieval village called Corsignano.

He hired architect Bernardo Rossellino and rebuilt the area based on Renaissance ideals of symmetry, order and harmony. The result? A site that feels intentional. The central square, Piazza Pio II, is flanked by a cathedral, a papal palace and a town hall, all arranged just so.

To survive, they sleep up to 20 hours a day while a specialised, bacteria-rich gut works to neutralise the poison. This slow-motion lifestyle is nature's masterstroke of adaptation.\nYet their future hangs in the balance. From habitat loss, disease and climate-driven threats like bushfires, koalas are at a critical crossroads.

Males measure about 25 centimetres in length with a wingspan of almost 60 centimetres, while females are slightly larger, around 30 centimetres long, with a wingspan over 60 centimetres.\nFound across northern North America and Eurasia, boreal owls favour dense coniferous and mixed forests. Mostly active at night, they are highly secretive, using their sharp hearing and vision to hunt small mammals such as voles and mice and occasionally birds or large insects. In spring, they nest in tree cavities, old woodpecker holes or nest boxes, laying three to seven eggs, with females incubating while males bring food. Conservation of their forest habitats remains vital to ensure these elusive owls continue to thrive.",

Its name literally translates as 'Bridge of Peace and Propitiousness,' reflecting its role as both a practical crossing and a symbol of the city. The original bridge was built in 1746 but suffered repeated damage from floods over the centuries. The current structure, completed in 2003, preserves the architectural style of the Ming and Qing dynasties and spans 81 metres in length and 6 metres in width. The bridge features handrails with traditional floral carvings, water-beast statues on the piers and memorial archways on each side, reflecting classic Chinese architecture. It serves as a cultural landmark and a hub for tourism, featuring a restaurant on the upper level, hosting occasional cultural events and offering an illuminated night view that has become one of Chengdu's most photographed attractions.",

The change usually begins in September and early October, with higher slopes turning first, followed by the lower valleys. Among the stars of this display are the aspens, whose leaves shimmer like gold coins in the sunlight. The magic of aspen colours, however, isn't guaranteed year after year. Their golden glow depends on many factors—tree health, local weather shifts, soil moisture and where they grow in terms of elevation and latitude.\nHealthy aspens are the true stars of the season: strong, thriving groves burst with brighter colours and hold onto their leaves longer, while stressed or weakened trees often fade quickly, offering only a glimpse of their usual brilliance. A spot that dazzled one autumn might look muted the next. Today's image captures their full glow at the base of Mount Sneffels, the highest peak in the Sneffels Range, in Colorado, United States, rising more than 2,100 metres above the town of Ridgway.",

Despite its name, this village isn't directly on the Saranac Lakes themselves but rather on Lake Flower, a wide section of the Saranac River. For centuries, the area—nicknamed 'The Capital of the Adirondacks'—was used by Indigenous peoples for hunting and travel. By the late 19th century, it gained fame as a health retreat, where Dr. Edward Livingston Trudeau pioneered fresh-air treatment for tuberculosis. The cure cottages from that era still stand today.\nToday, Saranac Lake has shifted from curing patients to curing boredom. Visitors paddle the waterways, hike the High Peaks and enjoy winter activities like skiing and ice fishing. The village also boasts a lively arts scene, with galleries, music and community festivals making culture as central as the outdoors.

Its unique architecture has roots in the late 19th century. Sailors and merchants carved houses right into the volcanic cliffs—cool in summer and warm in winter. The white-and-blue theme is also more than just for show: houses were painted with lime wash so rainwater would run off and be collected. Today, visitors wander its cobbled lanes, explore the Naval Maritime Museum or climb to the ruins of Agios Nikolaos Castle for unforgettable sunsets.\nNicknamed the 'Eagle's Nest,' Oia overlooks the volcanic islets of Palia and Nea Kameni, as well as Therasia, which was physically connected to Santorini before the Minoan eruption.

Males and females carve out their own territories, marking them with scratches and scent—like secret notes left in the forest. Their elusive nature did not protect them from humans: during the 1970s and '80s, thousands of lynx pelts were exported from Russia and China, pushing populations toward dangerous lows.

Its original purpose remains elusive and for archaeology, the questions can be as valuable as the answers. Where written records fail, the land tells its story.

		"description": "A pumpkin farm is a patchwork of colour, life and tradition, with every gourd waiting its turn to shine. Walking through the fields, you'll spot pumpkins of all shapes and sizes, from small decorative varieties to the giants that have inspired growers worldwide. Interestingly, the heaviest pumpkin ever recorded weighed an incredible 1,246.9 kilograms. Despite their solid appearance, pumpkins can float effortlessly because they are 92% water. These gourds have rolled their way into pies, porches, lattes and parades. The colour of pumpkins comes from beta-carotene, but not all are orange—some grow white, green or even blue. Their utility doesn't end there—pumpkins have stood guard as scarecrows, been launched in pumpkin-chucking contests and even hollowed out for boat races.",

		"description": "Perched high in the mountains of Ethiopia, Eritrea and Somalia, the thick-billed raven holds the title of the world's largest raven. At more than 70 centimetres in length and weighing over a kilogram, it is about a quarter heavier than the common raven. Its enormous, arched bill—pale at the base and close to 8 centimetres long—is the largest among perching birds. These ravens live mostly between 1,500 and 3,400 metres above sea level, found across farmland, rocky cliffs and even rooftops in mountain towns.\nThick-billed ravens are versatile feeders, taking carrion, insects, beetle larvae, seeds and crops like wheat along with scraps from people. Observers have seen them pulling grubs from dung heaps and even forcing Verreaux's eagle-owls from their nests. Often seen in pairs or small groups, they build large stick nests on cliffs or tall trees, laying three to five bluish-green eggs. Their calls range from deep croaks to wheezy notes and rare instances of mimicry have been recorded. Their plumage gleams purple in sunlight, a striking figure of the African highlands. Classified as 'least-concern' by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, the thick-billed raven continues to thrive.",

		"description": "From 18th-century visitors to fire-carved trails, this rock city tells a story of survival. Hidden in Czechia's Hradec Králové Region, the Adršpach–Teplice Rocks form Central Europe's largest sandstone labyrinth. For centuries, the cliffs and passages lay cloaked in forest until a great fire stripped the land bare. Arches, towers and winding corridors emerged out of the ashes and the first hiking paths were carved into the rock. Soon after, explorers and poets left their marks with stone inscriptions that captured a destination both wild and enchanting.\nToday, the reserve stretches over 13 square kilometres, preserved within the Broumovsko Protected Landscape Area. Among its treasures stands the Gothic Gate, featured here, which was built in 1839. Commissioned by Ludvik Karel Nádherný along with a network of hiking paths, bridges and stairways, this striking archway became the symbolic threshold to the City of Rocks. More than a relic of the past, the Gothic Gate still stands as guardian of the labyrinth, welcoming every visitor who steps into the park.",

On its northern slopes lies Fanal Forest, where veils of mist drift through centuries-old til trees. These are part of the Laurissilva of Madeira—an outstanding relict of a once widespread laurel forest type. Laurissilva is the largest surviving area of its kind, with about 90% considered primary forest. Home to a unique array of plants and animals, including endemic species such as the Madeiran long-toed pigeon, it remains a living museum of natural history.\nIn Fanal, the gnarled, moss-draped trunks stand as guardians of this ancient heritage, where nature has preserved its vitality for centuries. Beyond the trails, these woods also offer quiet corners to pause and enjoy. Between scenic viewpoints, a leisure area with a public barbecue and even a winter lake born from an ancient crater, this is a place to be dazzled, to wander, to play—or simply to breathe and relax.",

Their humps don't hold water, as many think—they store fat, which the camel can turn into energy during long, food-scarce journeys. These incredible animals can go for days without drinking, enduring extreme heat and dehydration, and when they finally find water, they can drink astonishing amounts—up to 140 litres at a time. Their long eyelashes, ear hairs and closable nostrils protect them from whipping sandstorms, while their wide, padded feet let them stride effortlessly across blazing desert sands.

Hundreds of polar bears gather nearby, waiting for Hudson Bay to freeze so they can hunt seals again—their primary food source. Ever wonder how they stay warm? A thick layer of fat and a dense undercoat trap heat. Their tangle-resistant hairs shake dry after swimming and natural oils stop the coat from freezing, keeping these Arctic giants well insulated against the chill.

Bison roam the open range, bighorn sheep climb steep bluffs and prairie dogs build underground colonies, known as 'towns,' that can stretch for kilometres. Roberts Prairie Dog Town, where today's image was captured, is the park's largest accessible colony, supporting nearly 200 plant and animal species.

Commissioned by the Flavian emperor Vespasian in 72 CE and finished by his son Titus in 80 CE, this amphitheatre broke tradition with its predecessors that were built into hillsides for natural support. Instead, the Colosseum was a fully free-standing architectural giant. Crafted from stone and concrete, its arches and vaults supported an arena that could host up to 50,000 spectators. Gladiators, exotic animals and even staged sea battles thrilled the crowds, while hidden lifts and trapdoors created sudden, dramatic appearances.\nDuring the Middle Ages, the Colosseum found new purposes: first as a church, later as a fortress. Over the centuries, it endured damage from lightning strikes, earthquakes and pollution. Much of its marble and travertine was also reused in palaces, fortifications and even churches—a practice known as 'spolia,' which quite literally wove pieces of the structure into the evolving city of Rome. It wasn't until the 19th century that serious preservation began.

Later, during World War II, Resistance fighters used the traboules as escape routes.\nMost of Lyon's traboules are tucked away in the Vieux Lyon and Croix-Rousse districts. Push open what looks like an ordinary wooden door and you might step into a courtyard with spiral staircases, arched galleries and stone corridors that snake between buildings.

They are agile divers, plunging beneath the surface to catch fish and other prey. Males, known as drakes, stand out with their fan-shaped white crests, dark heads and chestnut-brown sides, while females, called hens, are brownish grey with smaller crests. Oregon's lakes and wetlands provide sheltered feeding grounds as these birds migrate or winter across the continent.\nAmong the six living merganser species, hooded mergansers are the second smallest. They are known for their striking courtship displays, where males raise their crests dramatically to attract mates, creating unmistakable shapes on still water. They nest in tree cavities near wetlands and soon after hatching, ducklings leap to the ground to follow their mother to water. Classified as Least Concern on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List, their populations remain stable across their range.

		"description": "Step closer and the details begin to speak—every stone, spire and statue seems to hold a story of its own. Conceived in the late 19th century, the Hungarian Parliament Building was designed to reflect a nation's ambition, blending Gothic Revival elegance with distinctly Hungarian motifs. Architect Imre Steindl's vision took shape over two decades through the work of more than 1,000 craftsmen. Even the central dome, rising 96 metres high, carries meaning: the height honours the year of Hungary's millennium anniversary in 1896. Completed in 1904, the building still dominates Budapest's skyline as a powerful national symbol.\nStep inside and the richness deepens. Gold leaf shimmers across staircases and halls, while statues of rulers and national figures line the corridors, turning history into spectacle. Beyond its political role, the Parliament has become a cultural emblem—hosting state ceremonies, welcoming millions of visitors annually and earning UNESCO World Heritage status. More than a landmark, it continues to tell Hungary's story through the details that first inspired its creation.",

Established in 1985, Chapada Diamantina National Park in Brazil celebrates 40 years of preservation this year. Located in the heart of the state of Bahia, the park is one of the most impressive ecotourism destinations, covering approximately 152,000 hectares of inspiring landscapes.\nThe park is famous for its waterfalls, caves, canyons and imposing mountains. Among the highlights is the 340-metre-high Cachoeira da Fumaça—one of the highest in Brazil. A curious phenomenon occurs on windy days: the water is thrown upwards, creating a stunning visual effect. Another must-see is Mount Pai Inácio, famous for its panoramic views and unforgettable sunsets.\nBesides the lush nature, the region has a rich history linked to the diamond boom of the 19th century, which gave rise to the name 'Chapada Diamantina.' Villages like Lençóis enchant with their colonial architecture, vibrant culture and Bahian hospitality. Ideal for hikers, adventurers and nature lovers, the park is a true national treasure.",

		"description": "Today's image features harbour seals—also known as common seals—which are true pinnipeds distinguished by their lack of visible ear flaps. They are found in the northern Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, as well as the Baltic and North Seas, typically staying near coastlines, which is how they got their name. Adults can weigh almost 170 kilograms and reach lengths of up to 2 metres. They display a variety of colours, from white or silvery grey to black or dark brown, often marked with distinctive spots and V-shaped nasal openings.\nHarbour seals are highly site faithful, often spending their entire lives along the same stretch of coastline. They haul out on rocky areas, sand, mud or ice, choosing spots that offer protection from predators and harsh weather while remaining close to rich feeding grounds. They are skilled swimmers and divers, feeding mainly on fish, shrimp, crabs and molluscs. Observing these intelligent creatures offers a glimpse into the delicate balance of marine ecosystems.",

		"description": "Look closely at this ammonite fossil. Its swirling shell, once home to a prehistoric sea creature, holds a mathematical secret—a spiral pattern. Each new chamber is proportionally larger than the previous one, maintaining a consistent growth ratio, often associated with the Fibonacci sequence.\nThe Fibonacci sequence was named after the 13th-century Italian mathematician Leonardo Bonacci (Fibonacci), who introduced the concept to Europe. The pattern 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8…—where each number is the sum of the two before it—was, however, first described in India as early as 200 BCE by the ancient poet-mathematician Pingala. The Fibonacci sequence appears widely in nature, including pineapples, artichokes, pinecones and the arrangement of leaves on a stem.\nAmmonites were molluscs that lived between 400 and 66 million years ago, gliding through ancient seas inside coiled shells that protected their soft bodies. When ammonites perished, sediment buried their shells and minerals slowly turned them to stone, preserving this natural geometry for millions of years. The ammonite fossil is a striking reminder that maths and nature speak the same language.",

The fort has seen rulers from the Tomars to the Mughals and is linked to battles, royal intrigue and hidden treasures.\nThe fort has six palaces, two of which were built by Raja Man Singh Tomar, who reigned from 1486 to 1516. The architecture reflects a blend of Hindu and Mughal styles. Key landmarks include the Man Mandir Palace, with its turquoise-tiled exterior, and the Sas-Bahu Temples, dedicated to Lord Aniruddha and Lord Shiva. Teli Temple, a rectangular shrine without pillared pavilions, stands out among other such structures. Secret passages and hidden vaults hint at treasures long rumoured to be stored inside.\nAs the sun sets behind the walls, a sound and light show brings the fort alive, narrating stories of kings, warriors and dynasties.

Completed in 1762, it marks the endpoint of one of ancient Rome's earliest aqueducts, the Aqua Virgo, which still supplies water today. The name 'Trevi' comes from Tre Vie—'three roads'—signifying the junction where it stands. Designed by Italian architect Nicola Salvi and finished by Giuseppe Pannini, this 26-metre marvel is the largest Baroque fountain in the city and one of the most famous in the world. Its sculptures show Oceanus, the god of the sea, surrounded by Tritons and horses.\nVisitors come for the view but stay for the ritual: toss a coin over your left shoulder and make a wish. Legend says one coin guarantees a return to Rome, two bring love and three lead to marriage. Around €2,600 to €3,400 worth of coins are thrown daily—roughly €1.3 million a year—all donated to charity.

Some trees across the island are older than its medieval cathedrals. Here, olives are gently picked, pressed within hours and transformed into an oil prized for its fruity, almond and herbal notes.

Opened in 1870, this Victorian marvel in East Sussex has survived tempests, fires and even wars. Stretching gracefully into the English Channel, the pier started life as a docking point for steamers. Over time, it evolved into a place where you can stroll above the water, lose a few coins to an arcade machine and gain a few back in memories.\nA severe storm in 1877 swept away the landward half of the pier, which was then rebuilt at a higher level on stilts that allowed it to flex and move slightly during rough weather. During World War II, sections of its decking were removed to mount machine guns for coastal defence. A 2014 fire that damaged part of the structure could have spelt the end. However, it was restored and reopened, bringing back its charm—complete with cafés, shops and the hum of seagulls.",

Its sky served as both compass and calendar, guiding celestial events and shaping temples, rituals and the rhythm of life. Around 426 CE, K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo', a warrior from the Maya heartland, founded Copán and established its royal dynasty. The city became a centre of Maya art, astronomy and power.\nAt the heart of Copán stand two monuments—stories in stone—that reflect its artistic and political brilliance: the Hieroglyphic Stairway and Altar Q. The stairway rises in 63 carved steps covered with more than 2,000 glyphs—the longest Maya inscription ever found—recording reigns, ceremonies and ambitions that shaped the city's power. Altar Q, standing beside it, translates that history into sculpture, portraying 16 rulers in sequence, preserving the story of a dynasty in stone.

		"description": "If llamas are the laid-back stars of the Andes, their cousins, the guanacos, are the free spirits of Patagonia. Guanacos are part of the same camelid family as llamas, alpacas and vicuñas. But unlike their domesticated relatives, they keep things wild. Found mainly in Argentina, Chile, Peru and Bolivia, they're built for life at high altitude. Their thick coats help them handle chilly winds, while their padded feet give them the grip to trek across rocky terrain that would make even mountain goats nervous.\nSocial creatures, guanacos usually hang out in herds—led by a dominant male who keeps a close eye on the group. Communication is key in their world. Spot a predator and a guanaco will let out a sharp bleat that basically means, 'Run for it!' These wild wanderers also play an important ecological role. As grazers, they help maintain grassland balance and their droppings enrich the soil, keeping Patagonia's ecosystem healthy.",

		"description": "Among the silent crests of the Abruzzo Apennines in Italy, when autumn begins to touch the rocks with amber fingers, the Castle of Rocca Calascio appears like a mirage of stone and wind. At over 1,400 metres above sea level, the fortress has watched over valleys tinged with copper and gold for centuries, suspended between heaven and Earth like an ancient thought.\nIt was never a palace, but a sentinel: a watchtower, then a fortress, then a ruin. It has witnessed shepherds, barons, earthquakes and silences. It has listened to the distant sound of flocks, the slow pace of pilgrims, the whisper of snowfall. Yet, it has remained etched in time like an unforgettable word. At its feet, the village has slowly emptied, leaving space for the mountain's breath and for those who seek stories in the rustling of the leaves.\nToday, as the sun sets behind Campo Imperatore (Emperor's Field) and the air grows thin, the Castle of Rocca Calascio doesn't narrate, it suggests. Because certain places aren't visited but traversed. And certain silences aren't explained but inhabited. And in that silence, every stone seems to hold a promise: to remain, even when everything changes.",

On the crest of the Great Himalayas of southern Asia, along the border between Nepal and Tibet, stands Mount Everest. At over 8,800 metres, it is the world's highest peak and a symbol of human aspiration and natural beauty. In 1953, Sir Edmund Hillary of New Zealand and Tenzing Norgay, a Nepali Sherpa climber, were the first to successfully reach its summit, marking a historic achievement in exploration. Its glaciers feed rivers sustaining millions, showing that mountains are more than scenery—they are lifelines.\nHowever, these glaciers are melting rapidly due to rising global temperatures. This threatens agriculture, water security, energy production and the livelihoods of billions. Retreating glaciers and thawing permafrost also heighten hazards like floods, landslides and erosion, putting communities and infrastructure at risk. Mountains and glaciers are vital ecosystems that sustain life, influence climate and support biodiversity. Whether marvelling at Everest or hiking a local ridge, we are reminded to reconnect with these majestic landscapes and protect the essential resources they provide.",

The poinsettia's common name comes from Joel Roberts Poinsett, the first United States minister to Mexico, who introduced it to the United States in the 1820s.\nDid you know the poinsettia's red parts aren't actually flowers? They're leaves called bracts. The real flowers are those tiny yellow buds in the middle. Today, poinsettias come in over a hundred shades—pink, white, marbled, even speckled. Whatever your style, there's a poinsettia to match your mood.\nDespite its attractive look, the poinsettia still has to fight off some myths. The biggest one? That it's poisonous.

It gathers meltwater and winds 233 kilometres west through Yosemite Valley into California's Central Valley.\nIts Spanish name, 'El Río de Nuestra Señora de la Merced,'translates to 'River of Our Lady of Mercy,' and suits it well: it offers both calm and chaos depending on the season. Spring turns the river into Yosemite's main act, as snowmelt sends torrents rushing beneath stone bridges and past roaring waterfalls like Vernal and Nevada Falls. Summer brings a gentler flow that attracts rafters and swimmers. Fall adds a hint of gold as leaves drift downstream, and winter slows everything to a reflective stillness. Interestingly, it feeds Lake McClure, where a ghost town rises when water levels drop in fall and winter. Along its lower stretches once stood Merced Falls, a bustling mill town during the Gold Rush era, now lying quiet.",

From ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt to medieval Europe, they transformed cities like Venice and Bruges into trade hubs. The Netherlands took this even further—by the 17th century, they were designing waterways that shaped cities such as Amsterdam.\nIt's no wonder Amsterdam is nicknamed the 'Venice of the North.' The city's around 100-kilometres-long network of canals forms part of the UNESCO-listed Canal District. Mostly flanked by roads on both sides, these routes are now used for tourism and recreation. In the centre of the city is the Spiegelgracht canal seen in today's image. It is famous for its art galleries, antique shops and serene reflections that inspired its name, 'Mirror Canal.' As night falls, bridges and trees glow with festive lights, their reflections shimmering across the calm water.

There are two solstices each year: the summer solstice and the winter solstice.\nThe summer solstice, occurring around June in the Northern Hemisphere and December in the Southern Hemisphere, marks the longest day of the year, when the Sun reaches its highest point in the sky above the Tropic of Cancer. In contrast, the winter solstice happens around December in the Northern Hemisphere and June in the Southern Hemisphere, brings the shortest day and the longest night, as the Sun hovers over the Tropic of Capricorn.\nThough science now explains the phenomenon, its symbolism endures—a reminder that even in the darkest moment of the year, the world is already turning back toward the light.",

Thin sheets fracture under shifting temperatures, then drift and stack as the wind presses them toward land. The result is a field of translucent blues and silvers, catching the light at sharp angles and making the water's edge appear sculpted rather than frozen.\nBeneath the surface, waves keep moving, pushing the slabs against one another as they scrape, ring and groan. The sounds rise and fall with the motion, turning the shoreline into a fleeting, shifting performance. These formations can appear suddenly and disappear just as quickly, changing with every gust and temperature dip.\nLake Superior's immense scale shapes this phenomenon. As the world's largest freshwater lake by surface area, spanning over 82,000 square kilometres, its depth, wind patterns and temperature swings set the stage for this winter display.

As it laps up nectar, pollen sticks to its snout, turning it into one of the habitat's most effective pollinators.\nMany people recognise lemurs from the animated movie 'Madagascar,' but the real animal faces a much harsher reality.

Each layer of chalk preserves the memory of vanished oceans, teeming with ammonites and corals, reminding us that heritage is not limited to monuments erected by humankind, but also encompasses the silent works of the Earth.",

		"description": "In Japan's colder months, there's a morning moment when stillness breaks—not with wind or footsteps, but with a bright, rolling call that sweeps across the water. Whooper swans have touched down. One loud whoop—and winter suddenly feels awake. These birds migrate from Siberia and the Russian Far East, choosing Japan as their seasonal home because its lakes offer what long-distance travellers crave: open water, steady food and a safe place to rest. One of their favourite destinations is Kotoku Pond in the Kantō region on Japan's largest island.\nWhooper swans make an impression from the start, with tall necks, white feathers and yellow-and-black bills. Add a call that carries kilometres and they become impossible to miss. Families migrate together, keep close on the water and coordinate flights with those trumpet-like notes. At places like Kotoku Pond, dawn departures are the highlight. While in Japan, their diet is simple: grains, aquatic plants and grasses. Moreover, healthy wetlands attract them and their return each winter signals that the ecosystem is thriving.",

Spanning the River Spree between Friedrichshain and Kreuzberg, it connects two districts while juggling trains on top, traffic below and crowds of sunset hunters in between. Originally a wooden crossing, the bridge took on its signature red-brick Gothic revival form in 1896, complete with turreted towers that look like they wandered in from a medieval set. But the real twist came during the Cold War, when the bridge became a strict checkpoint between East and West. After reunification, it was restored in the 1990s and welcomed the U1 line back across its upper deck.\nToday, the bridge doubles as a viewpoint and a cultural hangout. Street musicians try their luck, photographers wait for perfect light and the Spree keeps the reflections running. Oberbaum Bridge doesn't just connect neighbourhoods—it connects eras, ideas and anyone who enjoys a good 'arch' in the plot.",

This highly adapted mammal is native to the cold Arctic and sub-Arctic regions, including parts of Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Iceland, northern Europe and Russia. Arctic foxes have evolved unique physical traits that help them thrive in some of the world's most extreme environments.\nIn winter, their thick white fur camouflages them against the snow, while in warmer months it shifts to brown or grey to blend in with rocky terrain and vegetation. Their compact bodies, typically weighing between 3 and 10 kilogrammes, help conserve heat. Their bushy tails not only aid in balance but also provide extra warmth when they curl up in the cold. Through these adaptations and survival strategies, the Arctic fox remains a striking symbol of resilience in the face of nature's toughest challenges.",

Founded in the 5th century on a cluster of islands in the Venetian Lagoon, the early settlement rose from marshland to become a maritime powerhouse. By the Middle Ages, it had evolved into a major hub for trade between Europe and the East, fuelling immense wealth and cultural growth. The city's grandeur shines through its Gothic palaces, Renaissance art and landmarks such as St. Mark's Basilica, the Doge's Palace and the Rialto Bridge.\nVenice is celebrated not only for its iconic architecture and interwoven canals but also for the brilliant minds who shaped its legacy. 'The Travels of Marco Polo' chronicles the adventures of the Venetian merchant and explorer, and Antonio Vivaldi—composer of 'The Four Seasons'—was also born here. The city has inspired timeless works, including Thomas Mann's 'Death in Venice,' Shakespeare's 'The Merchant of Venice' and 'Othello,' and Henry James's novella 'The Aspern Papers.'\nToday, Venice balances historic charm with modern challenges—from preserving fragile architecture to managing tourism.

Since 1926, its 150 square kilometres have supported research and monitored wildlife behaviour in their natural habitat. Located within the Sabi Sand Private Game Reserve, it is home to Africa's Big Five. Londolozi is part of a larger open system that connects with Kruger National Park, allowing animals such as elephants, rhinos, lions, leopards, zebras and many antelope species to move freely without fences holding them back.\nAmong the species frequently spotted are impalas—always moving, always alert. Their adaptable feeding habits help them shift between flowering plants, acacia pods, forbs and fruits as the seasons change. Their social structure is just as interesting: females and young gather in herds, while males compete for territories during the breeding season. Most young are born in early summer after a gestation period of six to seven months. Even though they're quick and agile, predators such as leopards, lions and cheetahs keep them on edge. Drought cycles and habitat pressure add to the challenges, so protected spaces like Londolozi make a meaningful difference in their long-term survival.",

Rather than being repeatedly reshaped, the landscape evolved around cultivation, leaving behind a countryside still defined by open fields, rural settlements and long-standing routes through the land.\nWhat gives the Vale of Clwyd its character is continuity. Farming and local trade sustained communities here over long periods, allowing patterns of land use to change gradually rather than be replaced. While other parts of Wales were transformed by industry, this valley remained closely tied to rural life. Its history is not announced by monuments or dramatic landmarks, but carried quietly in field boundaries, road layouts and town forms.

That quiet reveal says everything about how these cats operate. They move with precision, slipping through grass and branches without making a sound. Their build, muscular but lean, helps them climb, sprint and hide in plain sight. Their rosetted coats? No two patterns match, each serving as natural camouflage from sunrise to moonlight.\nThese skilled swimmers follow no strict diet. They prey on antelopes when available, switch to hares or birds when needed and sometimes hunt at waterholes where other animals gather. When leopards secure a kill, they often cache it safely in a tree or a cave, using their strong forelimbs to keep it away from lions and hyenas.\nLeopards range across sub-Saharan Africa, India, Sri Lanka and small regions of Central and West Asia. Today's image was taken in Etosha National Park, in north-central Namibia, a haven for Africa's iconic wildlife.

Native to forests across Europe and parts of Asia, red squirrels depend on a varied diet of seeds, nuts, buds and fungi. To prepare for colder months, they scatter food stores across their territory and construct well-insulated nests—called dreys—inside tree hollows or high among branches.\nDespite their reputation as garden raiders or urban 'nuisances,' squirrels play essential roles in local ecosystems. By burying seeds and failing to recover every cache, they unintentionally aid tree growth, particularly among conifers that rely on ground dispersal. Unlike animals that hibernate, red squirrels stay active throughout winter, timing their foraging trips between snowfalls and relying on memory and scent to locate hidden supplies. Their fur not only provides warmth but also improves camouflage against snowy backdrops.\nSmall, alert and endlessly busy, they're a reminder that even the smallest creatures have big strategies—and plenty of attitude—to match the cold.",

Lake Tahoe, straddling the border between California and Nevada, United States, fits that bill perfectly. Formed during the Ice Age, the lake was shaped by faulting and glacial carving that created its deep basin. It is now one of the deepest freshwater lakes in the United States. For generations, the Washoe people lived around these clear waters, fishing and gathering seasonally. Centuries later, miners arrived, steamboats crossed the water and Tahoe shifted from a resource hub to a year-round retreat.\nEmerald Bay, seen in today's image, became one of its most photographed corners. Because the bay is shallower than the main lake, its water takes on a lighter hue. Beneath the surface rest old launches and barges, now preserved within Emerald Bay State Park. In the middle, Fannette Island rises with a small stone 'Tea House,' a 1920s structure built by philanthropist Lora Knight, who also commissioned Vikingsholm nearby. And the story doesn't end here.

Centuries back, families began carving these limestone pans, shaping hundreds of basins that trap seawater with each wave. Once the water settles in, the sun's heat does the rest, slowly evaporating it into natural Mediterranean salt. Gozo became a salt-making hub because its limestone coast is easy to shape, and its warm, dry summers keep the crystallisation process steady. The first crystals form around May, marking the beginning of the harvesting season. Workers rake the salt by hand, sweep it with brooms and brushes, gather it into small piles to dry for another day, then bag it and store it in the caves.\nVisitors can walk right up to the pans along the shore, but look out for 'no trespassing' signs. If you swing by in the summer, you might spot active raking and drying.

		"description": "Salar de Uyuni in Bolivia doesn't ease you in—it erupts into view like a horizon made of light. It's the world's largest salt flat, stretching across more than 10,400 square kilometres at nearly 3,658 metres above sea level. The landscape dramatically shifts with the seasons: when the rain arrives, the surface floods just enough to become an enormous mirror, so perfectly reflective that sky and ground melt into a single glowing plane.",
