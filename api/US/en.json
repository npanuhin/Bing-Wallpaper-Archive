Schwarzman Building – commonly known as the New York Public Library – on Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street in Midtown Manhattan. The rectangular room is almost the length of a football field and first opened to the public with the rest of the library in 1911. The building is one of the greatest examples of Beaux-Arts style architecture in the United States and has become a major New York landmark. It has featured in many films, including 'Breakfast at Tiffany's', 'Ghostbusters' and 'Spider-Man'. The Rose Main Reading Room, which is located on the third floor of the building, closed for renovation in May 2014 after an ornamental plaster rosette fell from its 16-metre-high ceiling and crashed to the floor. The room reopened just over two years later.",

Nearly a decade after the dome was built, fire ravaged the exterior and the site was unused until Environment Canada, a federal government environmental agency, bought it in 1990. Together with the city of Montreal, Environment Canada eventually turned the dome into Biosphere, a museum dedicated to environmental science and education about climate change. It’s just one of countless museums that you might visit today, on International Museum Day.",

In this way, the changing visibility of the sculpted earth mimics the waxing and waning of Earth’s moon, from full circle to slim crescent. Of course, the land artwork’s phases also illustrate the moon’s effect on Earth’s tides.",

But from time to time, humpbacks breach. That is, they propel themselves almost entirely out of the water and belly-flop back in. Scientists still aren’t sure exactly why humpbacks do this. It could be a hunting method, a way to clean themselves, or (our favorite hypothesis) simply for the fun of it.\nWe suspect this humpback may be lobtailing in celebration of World Oceans Day today.

But at different angles, times of day, and depending on the light and distance, the water of this small pond near Daisetsuzan National Park can look electric blue or turquoise. The current theory centers on the relatively high concentration of aluminum hydroxide in the sediment at the bottom of the pond, which can reflect light in a bright blue color.",

That phenomenon is called ‘heliotropism’ and it is common in many plants. Immature sunflowers do exhibit heliotropism, but by the time the plant is in full bloom, as seen in this photo, that behavior stops. But let’s cast that aside for a more important question: Do you eat roasted sunflower seeds whole (shell and all) or do you spit out the shell?",

The original mechanisms that achieved this function reveal Tower Bridge’s Victorian origins: Coal furnaces powered steam engines that lifted the spans. The steam works were replaced with electric technology in the early 1970s, but the original machinery is preserved, and can be viewed on a tour of Tower Bridge.",

We started our summer road trip in the oldest of our national parks, Yellowstone, and now we’re ending it in one of the newest: Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve, established in 2004. It’s the national park that most of you voted for in our poll to decide where to end our road trip, and it’s a fitting place to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the National Park Service, which was founded on this day in 1916. Congratulations, NPS, and here’s to the next 100 years!\nBut first, let’s consider our present surroundings. The 750-foot (and higher) sand dunes here are an awe-inspiring and unexpected feature of Colorado’s topography. And yet the towering hills of sand are just one feature of a patchwork landscape that also includes conifer forests, alpine lakes, and wetlands. The 85,000-acre park and preserve even encompasses stretches of tundra at the higher elevations, where it edges up against the base of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. It’s a magnificent setting for the final leg of our road trip as we consider the bittersweet reality that all things—even national parks road trips—come to an end. For now.",

Other divers in the Pacific and Indian Oceans reported seeing similar ‘mystery circles’ in the seabed. And in 2011, humans witnessed firsthand just what created them: white-spotted pufferfish. Males of the species work all day for a full week to create the unique patterns, some as wide as 6.5 feet, in an effort to attract the attention of female white-spotted pufferfish.

That makes it the newest national park in the United States, but its namesake features—these rock spires—were millions of years in the making. Roughly 23 million years ago, volcanos erupted to form a 30-mile-wide volcanic field, which was then split in two by a shift in the San Andreas fault. The western side of the field gradually moved nearly 200 miles north, all the while being eroded by water, ice, and wind.\nThe rock that’s left behind is now shaped into these pinnacles. The towering spires attract rock climbers, to be sure, but they also provide homes for many species of animals, including the California condor. In fact, this is just one of four places where captive-bred condors are released into the wild. And the pinnacles aren’t the only amazing rock formations in this park—it’s also distinguished by unusual talus caves, which were formed when massive boulders were wedged into narrow ravines. So when the searing heat of Pinnacles National Park gets to be too much for you, catch a little shade beneath these house-sized boulders.",

The result is a stained-glass effect that can change over the course of a day as sunlight and artificial light accentuate different aspects of the glass patterns.",

The lack of trees gave rise to one of its nicknames: ‘Bald Mountain.’ Ask any cycle racing enthusiast, and they’ll probably tell you Ventoux’s other nickname: 'The Beast of Provence.' The mountain pass on this windy peak has been part of the Tour de France course 15 times in the past 65 years. Aside from all that uphill pedaling, a large part of the challenge is the winds that whip over the peak and down the mountainside.",

		"description": "You're looking at acoustic tiles on the ceiling of the Royal Albert Hall in London, one of the most famous buildings in the world. Opened in 1871, Queen Victoria dedicated the hall to the memory of her husband, Albert, who died in 1861. The building was intended as a ‘Hall of Arts and Sciences,’ not a concert venue, so acoustics weren’t a primary consideration in its design. Nevertheless, a concert was performed immediately after the hall’s inauguration, and a strong echo of the music so tormented audience members that problems with the building’s acoustics soon became infamous. It was often said that the Royal Albert Hall was 'the only place where a British composer could be sure of hearing his work twice.'\nThe earliest attempt to remedy the hall’s acoustics involved a large canvas awning suspended below the dome, which helped, but was still deemed inadequate. The awning was replaced by fluted aluminum panels in 1949, but they too did little to stanch the echo. Finally, in 1969, these blue acoustic diffusing discs were installed below the aluminum panels. The 'mushrooms' or 'flying saucers,' as they’re commonly called, improved the hall’s acoustics dramatically and—we think—added a stylish modern flair to the Victorian landmark.",

It’s an easy way to avoid becoming prey. Honestly, we aren’t hungry. We just like that this sea slug’s markings make it look like a rubber monster mask, cast off after a long night of Halloween fun.",

Today, Veliko Tarnovo (Great Tarnovo in English) is a busy manufacturing center with architecture representing the region’s numerous historic periods, including the Second Empire-era fortress known as the Tsarevets.",

Minerva Terrace has been dry during the past few years thanks to recent earthquake activity, but when the geothermal springs are flowing, the water is continually reshaping the area, drawing limestone up from the ground and depositing it on the surface to form these pale stone formations. Colors on the travertine come from algae living in the warm water.",

Now the village, overgrown and slowly decaying, has become something of a tourist attraction, with a few full-time residents conducting tours of this eerie, green ghost town.",

It digests the leaves it eats with a gut full of enzymes that ferment the food, and that fermentation gives off an unpleasant odor. Surely there’s some inspiration there.

After decades of local efforts, activists organized the first national women’s suffrage demonstration in 1913 in Washington, DC. The march took place on the eve of Woodrow Wilson’s presidential inauguration. Organized chiefly by Alice Paul, the parade gathered as many as 8,000 marchers to demand an amendment to the Constitution guaranteeing women the right to vote. As the parade moved down Pennsylvania Avenue, seen here, it became choked with tens of thousands of onlookers—mainly men—many of whom shoved and tripped the marchers while policemen stood by. In the end, more than 100 marchers were hospitalized, but the ensuing publicity garnered support for their cause, eventually leading to popular backing for the passage of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution. In 1920 women finally gained the right to vote in the United States.",

To see one of the specimens that earned the bird its colorful name, make sure you’re looking for a male. He’s the one with the bright red cap, face, and chest. There are rare sightings of the common rosefinch in the eastern reaches of Great Britain and even rarer sightings on the far western coast of Alaska, the bird’s only appearance in the Western Hemisphere. Which makes the common rosefinch uncommon, at least on this side of the pond.",

Finally, in 1932, construction resumed with gusto and the palacio opened two years later. Countless operas, ballets, symphonies, and other cultural events have been staged here, but the building itself is also a work of art. With an Art Nouveau exterior and an Art Deco interior, the building is home to significant murals by Mexican artists including Diego Rivera.",

Government predator control programs in the early 20th century accelerated this trend, and wolves were eliminated from Yellowstone altogether by 1926. But that would all change when the alpha predator was reintroduced to the park in 1995. Many of the nearly 200 wolves that roam the park today, like the one seen in this photo, wear tracking collars. These collars allow researchers to monitor the movements and hunting habits of the wolves. The wolves’ reintroduction to Yellowstone has helped return the elk population to its historically low levels, which in turn has helped the park’s ecosystem repair itself.",

		"description": "Even on a chilly day in Glasgow, temperatures in the Kibble Palace are warm enough to keep the plants inside green and healthy. The ornate iron-framed conservatory was built in 1865 by Joseph Kibble, an inventor and engineer, at his estate on Long Loch. It was later moved to the Glasgow Botanic Gardens in the city’s West End, where the Kibble Palace opened in 1873 as a venue for music performances and public lectures. A few years later it was converted to a greenhouse, which it’s been ever since, housing temperate plants from around the world. Resting amidst the greenery, a collection of classical white marble statues strike an air of quiet repose.",

The dams were first planned in 1920, but the Great Depression halted any actual work. Even the Nazis tried to get involved but gave up as the tide of WWII changed. Once Austria was freed by Allied forces, the efforts of the Marshall Plan helped finish the dams and power plant.",

The structure seen here is called the Rama Yantra, and was used to observe the position of celestial objects like stars and planets. The observatory complex also includes an enormous sundial that could measure time to an accuracy of 2 seconds, a degree of precision never previously achieved. The Maharaja Jai Singh II commissioned the construction of five such observatories across northern India between 1721 and 1730, each named Jantar Mantar. By locating the sites in different locations, astronomers could compare readings from different coordinates, enabling them to achieve greater accuracy.",

By grazing in these areas, as tarpans once did, Koniks control the growth of trees and scrub, making the ecosystem more hospitable for a greater variety of plant and animal species.",

Made famous by the Cervantes novel ‘Don Quixote,’ these windmills are found in the village of Consuegra, near an ancient castle that was once home to the Knights of San Juan, the Spanish branch of the Order of St. John. First published in 1605, ‘Don Quixote’ is widely regarded as one of the world’s great works of fiction, and it continues to inspire. A new film loosely based on the novel is set to arrive in US theaters in 2018.",

The Great Salt Lake is the largest salt water lake in the Western Hemisphere, but it’s only a remnant of a much bigger body of water–Lake Bonneville. This prehistoric lake covered most of western Utah some 30,000 years ago. In the last ice age, the lake breeched its natural dam and much of the water was released in the Bonneville Flood, an event that inundated eastern Washington and Idaho, carving out canyons and creating waterfalls that still exist today.",

In a bog—a wetland also called a quagmire or a muskeg—the landscape is so saturated that it restricts the flow of oxygen from the atmosphere, which causes plant matter to slowly decay, eventually forming peat. It may not sound pleasant, but this mucky terrain is certainly useful. As peat accumulates in the spongey, wet environment, it serves as a carbon sink, absorbing harmful carbon dioxide. Once harvested, peat proves its worth as a fuel source and lends that smoky taste to scotch whisky. In recent years, peat bogs have become the, er, grounds for the sport of bog snorkeling.

The display has been the subject of much study regarding sexually selected traits and the tradeoffs between physical constraint and attracting a mate, since the tail feathers don’t seem to aid in flight and may even cause a hinderance. Ah, the things we do for love.",

Expressed as a form of free verse without rhyme and with ever-changing meter and rhythm, Whitman’s style was highly personal, but also expansive, meant to reflect the limitless possibilities of Americans and the United States itself. He spent years revising and adding to the compilation of poems and today is regarded as one of the most important of American poets.

It’s packed with nutrients (the entire plant is edible) and serves as a good companion plant in the garden, where it attracts pollinators and adds minerals to the soil. And the dandelion can be beautiful, too, as in this colored x-ray photograph. That’s something to consider on National Weed Your Garden Day (yes, that’s today). So, as Wilcox writes in her poem ‘The Weed,’ ‘Go dig, and prune, and guide, and wait.’",

Our nation’s first flag had 13 stars and 13 red and white stripes to represent the original 13 colonies that broke from British rule. The stars were arranged on a blue background to represent a ‘new constellation.’ In 1795, as Vermont and Kentucky joined the Union, two more stars and two stripes were added. It was this version that served as muse to poet Francis Scott Key, who penned the poem that would later serve as the lyrics for ‘The Star-Spangled Banner.’ He wrote the words after watching the flag fly over the Battle of Baltimore during the War of 1812. The flags in our image are rippling over Liberty State Park in Jersey City, New Jersey.",

Puffins can dig their own burrows, as they prefer to build nests underground atop seaside cliffs. But if there are rabbit warrens around, the puffins have no problem moving into empty burrows. They’re not even above kicking a rabbit out to take over.",

		"description": "Our Shark Awareness Day celebrity is a blue shark swimming in the cold waters off Cork, Ireland. The inspiration for its name comes from the blue shark’s back color, not its mood. It’s currently listed as ‘near threatened’—a status all too common for sharks today. Why celebrate an apex predator that most humans associate with horror movies? Because without sharks acting as population control on other marine life, the world’s oceans would be a very different place. Blue sharks eat a lot of squid and fish, and like land predators, help to keep their prey from overpopulation. Mother Nature keeps us in a delicate balance, so it’s important that we don’t accidentally remove a vital member of that system… even if that creature seems scary to most of us.",

Previous World Cup champs France face off against Croatia in today’s game. Croatia’s team is the 'Cinderella' of the match, as they’ve come through with some unexpected victories.

Every August, Earth passes through the trail of debris left by Comet Swift-Tuttle. When Swift-Tuttle’s ‘dirty snowballs’ of dust, ice, rock, and other material hit Earth’s atmosphere, they burn up as the ‘shooting stars’ of the Perseids. If you can, get away from city lights any time between now and Aug 24, find a safe spot outside, and let your eyes adjust to the dark for about 30 minutes. Look to the northern portion of the sky, or find the Perseus constellation, and you’ll start seeing streaks of light tumbling through the sky.",

As the concept of the ‘Russian Mountain’ ride caught on across Europe, mechanical parts came into play, including sled-like vehicles to ride in, and rails to keep the carts on track. Over the centuries, these coaster-like rides grew to resemble the extreme, gravity-challenging thrill rides we see at modern theme parks. Where is your favorite roller coaster?",

In the late 1700s, Barataria Bay was where the well-dressed smuggler and occasional pirate Jean Lafitte and his brother Pierre built a port. Far from the nearest US naval base and the prying eyes of customs officials, Barataria offered the brothers a safe place to smuggle in goods they'd stolen from ships in the Caribbean, or sometimes bought on the black market. They then sold the merchandise, mainly to merchants in New Orleans. Jean Lafitte and his comrades also helped to defend New Orleans against the British in the final battle of the War of 1812. These days, he’s chiefly remembered for his heroism in the Battle of New Orleans and for the jobs and goods he provided in the region--the erstwhile pirate is a folk hero of a sort, and famous enough that a national historical park was named for him.",

An entire market for various pencil accoutrements existed in the 18th and 19th centuries, including a pencil grip called an ‘extender’ that allowed you to use the last bit of a pencil so as not to waste what was, at the time, a precious commodity. Think of it in terms of all the things you buy to enhance your mobile phone or tablet, and then imagine that the pencil once held equal value as a communication device.

While spending a rainy summer on Lake Geneva in Switzerland, Shelley (nee Godwin), her future husband Percy Bysshe Shelley, and Byron, all decided to try writing ghost stories. Mary Shelley outdid the others by creating the well-known story of the mad doctor who brings the dead back to life. Her book is often cited as the first true work of science fiction.",

		"description": "Reconstruction after the Sept 11 attacks included not just rebuilding on the site of the Twin Towers, but replacing the transit hub station there as well. The new vision for the transit hub includes the Oculus, a building designed by Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava. A defining feature of the Oculus is a skylight at the peak of its roof, which is opened on clear days, flooding the space below with light and giving patrons a view of the new One World Trade Center building. And every Sept 11, the skylight is left open to the elements for 102 minutes—the duration of the attack on the World Trade Center. The elegant transit station is often busy with travelers making a quick stop to shop or eat, since most of the space is dedicated to retail, as it had been before the attacks on 9/11.",

On October 12 the following year, Munich citizens commemorated the wedding with another party, and an annual tradition was born. The festivities grew longer and longer each year over the course of two centuries, and Oktoberfest eventually extended into the weeks before the original date. Organizers supported the earlier start to take advantage of better weather in late September, but the party will forever be known as Oktoberfest.",

The US, UK, and USSR were the first parties to the treaty and at least 107 other nations have since joined them, with additional countries working on ratification. The treaty establishes ‘space law’—in essence, an agreement that space exploration should only be for the benefit of all of humanity. No weapons of mass destruction can be placed on the moon, or any other orbiting body.",

That future is a bright one. Research from UN Women indicates that when girls are provided an education, the rate of child marriage is reduced, as well as rates of disease. When women work, economies grow. And when the share of household income controlled by women increases, children benefit. It’s all the more reason to invest in education and equality for women and girls around the world.",

		"description": "In the fall of 1940, a group of boys exploring the outdoors in the Dordogne area of southwest France came upon the entrance to a cave–and unwittingly discovered a treasure trove of prehistoric art. The walls of the cave now known as ‘Lascaux’ are covered with hundreds of images–giant drawings of bulls, horses, and humans–created some 17,000 years ago, in the Upper Paleolithic Period. The cave was opened to the public in 1948, but after several years, scientists observed that the artwork was being damaged by carbon dioxide, heat, humidity, and other contaminants produced by an average of 1,200 daily visitors to the cave. To protect the prehistoric masterpieces, the cave has been closed to the public since 1963. Today, the closest you can get is viewing full-scale replicas at the International Centre for Cave Art in nearby Montignac, where our homepage image was photographed.",

The meridian itself is essentially an imaginary line, arbitrarily placed. By the early 19th century, most maritime countries had established their own prime meridians to aid in navigation. But on this date in 1884, delegates from 25 nations met at a conference in Washington, DC, where they established Greenwich as the international standard for mapping and timekeeping. The decision made sense, as the Greenwich meridian was already widely used. But there was one holdout: France abstained from the vote and used its own prime meridian for several decades before eventually joining other countries in recognizing the Greenwich meridian.",

Fossils of the species are common in the Northern Hemisphere, but there was no known evidence that it existed after the Miocene Epoch, which ended more than 5 million years ago. The tree was thought to have been long extinct until 1944, when a giant dawn redwood was discovered in south central China. More were found in surrounding lowlands, and today the tree is a popular ornamental in many parts of the world.

The English and French fought for control of the castle for roughly 250 years, a span including their conflict in the Hundred Years War. France finally wrested control of it for good in 1449, but by the late 1500s, Château Gaillard was uninhabited and falling into ruin. Henry IV of France ordered it demolished in 1599.

		"description": "We’re in Florida’s Blue Spring State Park for Manatee Awareness Month. As winter approaches, Blue Spring becomes a safe harbor for manatees, aka sea cows, looking for warmer inland waters. It’s also a protected area for the manatees, where they can eat and swim without fear of injury from boats. In fact, researchers identify many of the manatees in Blue Spring by the scars they bear from accidental boat collisions and motor blade cuts. Identifying individual manatees has been crucial to tracking the population rebound of this once endangered species. A 2016 census of manatees in Florida’s springs counted 6,250 of the large, surprisingly graceful beasts.",

This park protects and preserves a 17,000-square-mile expanse of the Colombian Amazon, with a diverse ecosystem supporting many endemic species. In addition, officials believe that Chiribiquete could be home for various indigenous peoples living in voluntary isolation, the descendants of those who painted the ancient rock art.

According to legend, the poinsettia’s association with Christmas began in 16th-century Mexico, where a little girl—too poor to buy a gift—gathered weeds from the roadside and placed them in front of a church altar. They eventually produced lovely red leaves alongside the green ones, and the poinsettia plant was on its way to becoming a Christmas tradition.",

Then in 1944, the San Francisco Ballet performed the American debut of the ballet to great acclaim. It became a true Christmastime classic 10 years later, when choreographer George Balanchine staged his own 1954 production with the New York City Ballet. Balanchine’s version caught on and inspired other dance companies to stage it themselves. Today, ‘The Nutcracker’ is often such a draw that a staging of Tchaikovsky’s Christmas fantasy can help keep a ballet company financially stable.",

Immediately upon opening its doors, it became the place to see and be seen—and to be surrounded by opulence. The domed ceiling shown here was painted by Marc Chagall in 1964, covering the original ceiling paintings by artist Jules Lenepveu. Chagall’s colorful, dreamlike work stretches nearly 2,600 square feet and depicts scenes from operas by 14 different composers, including Beethoven and Debussy.",

Many people in Mongolia continue to hunt in this traditional fashion today.

It survives these harsh weather conditions by storing lots of fat underneath four layers of feathers. But the emperor penguin truly rules underwater, where it spends roughly half of its life. Studies show that an emperor can dive more than 1,700 feet below the surface, holding its breath more than 15 minutes at a time.

Parks was arrested in 1955 for refusing to give up her seat to a white passenger on a segregated bus in Montgomery, Alabama. Her defiant action sparked the Montgomery Bus Boycott, one of the longest and most successful movements against racial segregation in our nation’s history. At the time, African Americans made up most of the ridership on Montgomery city buses. The year-long protest finally ended when the US Supreme Court ruled that Alabama’s laws enforcing segregation on city buses and other modes of transportation were unconstitutional.",

Pangolins also have short legs and long, curved claws that come in handy when digging into an ant mound or a termite nest for food. By curling into a ball, the pangolin protects its belly and the inner parts of its limbs—the only areas of a pangolin’s body not covered by thick scales. But that defense is useless against its biggest threats, which include deforestation and poaching.

In any case, the Romans built up a complex of bathhouses over the course of 300 years or so, until the Roman withdrawal from Britain in 410. The baths gradually fell into disrepair, but were rebuilt several times, culminating in the elaborate 18th-century bathhouses that still stand today.

After centuries of successive rule by a variety of foreign powers, this Baltic state’s path to freedom began in the aftermath of World War I.

But scientists are studying the sometimes surprising ways in which African elephants converse—including the ultra-low frequency vocal sounds they make that are imperceptible to humans. These subharmonic ‘rumblings’ vibrate through the ground and can be felt by other elephants on the bottoms of their feet. And who knows, maybe these sounds follow a kind of grammatical structure we don’t yet comprehend. But perhaps we should start by trying to master English grammar.",

The Rio Tinto is home to unusual microorganisms that feed on its toxic mix and may also contribute to the river’s otherworldly environment. NASA even dispatched a team here to study the surface below the Rio Tinto because it closely resembles the subsurface on that other 'red' destination—Mars.

Uranus was named after the Greek god of the sky—but has become the 'butt' of many middle-school jokes. (Sorry, we couldn’t resist.) The planet, along with Neptune, is considered an ‘ice giant,’ with most of its mass made up of a hot, dense fluid of ‘icy’ materials including water, methane, and ammonia all hovering above its small, rocky core. Uranus’ atmosphere is made mostly of molecular hydrogen and atomic helium, with some methane. It’s the methane that makes the planet appear blue—the chemical compound absorbs red light from the sun and reflects the blue light back into space. Not only is it cold out there, but it’s also a little lonely. Uranus can’t support life as we know it, and the unmanned space probe Voyager 2, which took this photo, is so far the only spacecraft to fly by.",

In summer, we’re tilted toward the sun, so we can enjoy longer days and shorter nights. But the equinox is right in between. It's the moment during Earth's annual revolution around the sun when its axis is neither tilting away nor tilting toward the sun, giving everyone on the planet an equal split of day and night. This phenomenon happens twice a year—in March and again in September. For folks in the Northern Hemisphere, today signals a shift toward the long days of summer. But in the Southern Hemisphere, everything's flipped. It's the autumnal equinox today—and, yes, winter is coming.",

This year’s theme for International Day of Forests is ‘forests and education’; it’s an effort to get us all thinking about the more abstract benefits of healthy forests. A dense forest can clean both the air and water by pulling carbon compounds and other pollutants out of the ecosystem, and forests greatly reduce erosion.",

Originally created for the 1889 World’s Fair, the Eiffel Tower was the world's tallest structure for more than 40 years, until New York’s Chrysler Building edged it out in 1930.It may now be an iconic Paris landmark, but the Eiffel Tower initially met with sharp criticism from some leading French intellectuals and artists, who contended that the 'useless and monstrous' tower would crush 'under its barbaric bulk' such Paris monuments as the Arc de Triomphe and Notre-Dame. These critics may have been somewhat mollified to know that the tower was intended as just a temporary structure to be removed after 20 years. But as time passed, most people no longer wanted to see the tower go, and now approximately 7 million people visit it each year.",

Realizing what the cubs were doing, he knew he should document this event. Intent on getting the boat into the water, the cubs worked like they’d done this before. Lighting out onto the lake, the bears seemed to enjoy the ride.For years, scientists have known that brown bears are unusually intelligent. Observations of tool use in bears are common. Only this was something different—two cubs handling a small fishing boat like old pros. Later, the boat ran aground, and the ursine passengers exited, disappearing back into the forest.Don’t believe this story? Neither do we.

Dark-Sky Week is observed during the first new moon of April, when stars shine more brightly because the moon isn’t visible. The event was created to bring attention to the harmful effects of artificial light on the natural world, and to remind us of the beauty of an unadulterated night sky. Light pollution not only impacts our ability to see the stars and to sleep soundly, but also creates challenges for many nocturnal species, migrating birds, and even baby sea turtles. So, turn out those lights, look up, and be amazed at the sky that your great-great-grandparents saw.",

		"description": "For Earth Month, we’re highlighting the power of trees, which help to clean our air and watersheds while providing habitat for myriad species, including our own. In urban areas, trees provide unique benefits by cooling area temperatures, producing oxygen, increasing property values, and generally improving the scenery.But most trees in the United States are in forests. Roughly one-third of the country is covered by forests, and in many respects, they’re considered healthy. After centuries of forest clearing for settlement and development, total forest acreage in the US has held fairly steady for the past 100 years or so. But forests still face a variety of threats, from invasive species to disease and climate change.Given these threats, some scientists are turning to modern technology to measure forest health. For example, the experimental planting featured on our homepage today is called a Nelder plot, in which trees are planted at the intersections of concentric arcs and linear spokes. The design allows researchers to study the effects of many different planting densities in a single parcel. In another example, a company called SilviaTerra uses satellite imagery and artificial intelligence to create detailed maps of US forests that conservationists, governments, and landowners can use to develop management plans.",

And robots are experts at rote tasks that we humans find boring, like repetitive assembly work.The robot we’re featuring today, Pepper, is designed to work directly with customers, kind of like a receptionist.

		"description": "A Chinese proverb advises, ‘The best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago. The second-best time is now.’ That’s especially true today. It’s National Arbor Day in the US and we’re featuring this dramatic photo of coast redwoods to remind you of the incredible power and importance of trees. The very first recorded Arbor Day took place in 1594 in the little village of Mondoñedo in Spain, organized by its mayor. The first US Arbor Day was observed in Nebraska City, Nebraska, on April 10, 1872. It was organized by journalist and politician Julius Sterling Morton, who’d moved to Nebraska from Michigan, and called his adopted state a ‘treeless prairie.’ He rallied celebrants at that first US Arbor Day to plant an estimated 1 million trees.These days, National Arbor Day falls on the last Friday of April, but 22 states celebrate earlier or later depending on when the best time to plant trees falls in their region. For example, Florida and Georgia celebrate on the third Friday in January, while South Carolinians plant trees together on the first Friday in December. Whenever your state celebrates Arbor Day, it’s always a great time to plant a tree.",

		"description": "The bright flowers of these aloe plants offer a striking contrast to their more recognizable green, spiky stems. Native to Africa, Madagascar, and the Arabian Peninsula, aloes—including the well-known aloe vera species—are now grown outdoors in many locations that boast mild winter climates. They can bloom at any time throughout the year. And yes, even indoor potted aloes can be encouraged to bloom with the right amount of sunlight, water, and fertilizer.Aloes, like most of the world’s flowering plants, need help with pollination, which is essential for maintaining biodiversity and our food supply. That’s where this buzzing little hummingbird comes into play. As it feeds on the aloe flowers' nectar, it pollinates the plants, too. But, broadly speaking, pollinator populations are declining, whether they’re bees, butterflies, or birds. You can help by planting a pollinator garden and avoiding pesticides, which can harm the pollinators.",

		"description": "Spring means more than just April showers and May flowers. It's also the season when many baby animals are born. The rainy, warmer days bring new plant growth, which means nursing and foraging moms can provide their newborns with larger amounts of higher-quality food. It also maximizes the 'growing season' for spring babies, giving them time to increase in size and put on fat before winter arrives.But consider our brown-throated sloth baby (and yes, a newborn sloth is called a baby). It was probably born sometime in late summer, not spring. That’s because these sloths live in the Sloth Sanctuary of Costa Rica, which is just north of the equator, where the change in seasons isn’t as pronounced as in the higher latitudes. That means that here in the rainforest, no matter when the baby sloth is born, there will be lots of tough, rubbery leaves for the baby to eat once it stops nursing. And even though a baby sloth is fully weaned after just a few weeks, it will continue to cling to its mother’s fur for five months or more after birth.",

Located in eastern Guanajuato, it was named the American Cultural Capital in 2019 in celebration of its cultural heritage. This honor is given by an NGO called the International Bureau of Cultural Capitals, and it goes to just one city in either North, Central, or South America each year. The recognition comes with tourism marketing about the city in dozens of countries around the world, so others will learn about San Miguel de Allende’s many cultural charms and special events.This city’s history makes it a perfect destination to celebrate Cinco de Mayo. Spanish for ‘Fifth of May,’ the holiday commemorates the Mexican army's 1862 victory over France at the Battle of Puebla. The victory was especially significant because the Mexicans overcame France despite having a much smaller, less equipped army. Symbolically, it provided hope for the resistance, even after the French later took over Mexico City. These days, Cinco de Mayo is more widely celebrated in the US, where it’s regarded as a celebration of Mexican culture. How will you celebrate Cinco de Mayo?",

The new rail line linked the established railways of the eastern United States with the rapidly expanding railroads of the West, and made transcontinental travel via train a reality. Need some context? The alternative at the time would be to traverse the nearly 2,000-mile stretch between Omaha and San Francisco by horse, wagon, or your own two feet. With rail travel now an option, America’s westward expansion was suddenly in high gear.",

It was not until the early 1800s when an explorer saw the heads of the colossal statues poking through the sand that the temples were again discovered. Then in the 20th century, construction of a dam on the Nile River formed Lake Nasser, a massive reservoir that would have flooded the site where the temples stood. To save them from inundation, the temples were disassembled and relocated to a nearby hill. The process took almost five years and required that workers cut the temples into pieces and reassemble them exactly as they were built 3,000 years ago. We think Ramesses II would approve.",

The house-cat-sized creature is endemic to the islands, meaning it’s found nowhere else on Earth. In the 1990s, scientists observed the island fox population on Santa Cruz Island had dropped to fewer than 100 animals. The decline was attributed largely to golden eagles, who moved into new territory after bald eagle populations declined and found the island foxes to be easy prey. (Golden eagles are more prodigious hunters than bald eagles.) Environmental groups launched an effort to bring back the island fox, in part by relocating golden eagles, and by 2015, the population on Santa Cruz Island had rebounded to about 1,750. That’s good news for the fox–and for the entire island ecosystem. As the eagle situation demonstrated, most things in nature are interconnected.",

Accompanied by much marketing fanfare, this Copper River catch also signals the return of fresh wild Pacific salmon to grocery stores and restaurants. The price per pound, especially in the early days of the commercial season, is as rich as the fish are in Omega-3 fatty acids.But this area's not just about salmon. Here in the vast protected wilderness of Wrangell–St. Elias National Park and Preserve, the Copper River Delta is a birder's paradise, too. The 700,000-acre wetland is an important stop for millions of migrating western sandpipers and other shorebirds on their way to their breeding grounds in the Arctic. Other birds aren’t so quick to leave the delta—trumpeter swans and dusky Canada geese take in these beautiful surroundings and opt to have their babies right here.",

You’ll notice that despite its name, the green sea turtle’s shell is not green at all. The name comes from the color of its fat, which takes on a greenish hue after the adult turtle starts eating seagrass and algae. Unfortunately, like many other sea turtle species, the green sea turtle is endangered and its population shrinking due to hunting, boat-propeller accidents, plastic pollution, and loss of nesting grounds.World Turtle Day was established in 2000 to protect turtles and tortoises and their threatened habitats around the world. Conservation efforts are led by several nonprofit organizations such as American Tortoise Rescue, which focuses on the rescue, rehabilitation, adoption, and protection of all turtle species. Since the organization’s inception it’s rescued or rehomed more than 4,000 turtles across the world through a combination of community outreach programs and financial contributions from donors.",

As the fist-sized songbird flies north, its diet adapts to the environment. During winter among the palm trees, the Cape May drinks berry juice and the nectar from flowers thanks to its unusual semi-tubular tongue.

In 1981, Maya Lin was just 21 and still an undergraduate at Yale when she won a nationwide public competition to design the memorial. But when her design was unveiled, its minimalist and nontraditional approach sparked controversy. Many considered it bleak and thought the black granite symbolized defeat rather than honor. To address these criticisms, and over Lin's objections, a bronze statue of three servicemen was added to the plan. Later another statue, the Vietnam Women's Memorial, was erected south of the wall. Today the Vietnam Veterans Memorial is among the most popular and revered landmarks in DC, drawing over 4.5 million visitors a year.",

The Scripps National Spelling Bee is being held this week in National Harbor, Maryland, and savvy spellers from grade schools and middle schools around the world will compete for top honors.If last year’s competition is any indication, it should be dramatic stuff. In 2018, more than 500 students qualified for the 91st Scripps Spelling Bee after advancing in local competitions. But it was 14-year-old Karthik Nemmani, a middle school student from McKinney, Texas, who took home the crown when he correctly spelled the word ‘koinonia.’ Another Texan, a 12-year-old girl, placed second after she stumbled over the word ‘bewusstseinslage.’ Frankly, we’re quite certain we’d stumble over that word, too. We suspect the future is bright for both competitors.",

Knowing that the ability to land huge numbers of men, vehicles, and supplies would be crucial to the Allies’ success in the invasion of Normandy, Winston Churchill challenged his forces to come up with artificial harbors that could be towed into place and operational within days of the initial landings.Over 40,000 men were involved in the creation of two harbors that were installed at Omaha and Gold Beaches beginning on June 9, 1944, and which were completed just six days later. The harbors included breakwaters comprising sunken decommissioned ships, pre-built concrete caissons, 33 jetties, and over 10 miles of roadways. A violent storm on June 19 destroyed the harbor at Omaha Beach, but Mulberry B, at Arromanches, survived and by the time it was abandoned six months later it had landed 2.5 million men, 500,000 vehicles, and 4 million tons of supplies into northern France.",

		"description": "Humans have been trying to construct artificial coral reefs since at least the 1950s, with only marginal success. But in 1979, German scientist and inventor Wolf Hilbertz created ‘Biorock,’ also known as ‘Seacrete.’ Hilbertz found that by directing a low-voltage charge to a metal frame submerged in seawater, calcium and other minerals in the water would build up on the frame. This mineral coating is so similar to the mineral composition of natural reef substrate that it creates a good habitat for the growth of corals. After the minerals have begun to coat the surface, divers transplant coral fragments from other reefs, attaching them to the structure’s frame. These coral pieces begin to bond to the accreted mineral substrate and start to grow, typically faster than in natural environments. Eventually the reef looks and functions like a natural reef ecosystem rather than an artificial one.The story of Biorock is a good example of how technology and human innovation are important parts of the conservation movement, especially where Earth’s oceans are concerned. More than 70 percent of our planet’s surface is covered by oceans, and those oceans contain 97 percent of Earth’s water. That’s why ocean health is a global concern. It’s also the motivation behind World Oceans Day, celebrated every June 8. We’re celebrating with this photo of a Biorock reef off the Gili Islands in Indonesia.",

But Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art is a new must-see in the art world. Its collection includes paintings, sculpture, photography, drawing, and installation art from colonial times to today and features American artists such as Maya Lin, Andrew Wyeth, Jacob Lawrence, Jackson Pollock, and Georgia O’Keeffe. But perhaps the biggest piece of art is the museum itself. Designed by Moshe Safdie, the building blends seamlessly and beautifully into the surrounding Ozark landscape. In addition to the art and architecture collections, there are eight nature trails on the grounds. And admission to the museum is always free.",

		"description": "For World Rainforest Day we take you below these clouds to the Amazon River Basin and the largest rainforest in the world. Numbers help tell the story of this extraordinary place: At more than 2.1 million square miles, the Amazon accounts for half of Earth’s remaining tropical rainforests. And a fifth of the world’s fresh water flows through this river basin. Perhaps a tenth of the planet’s known species call it home, many of which have yet to be identified—that’s trees, plants, fish, mammals, and a third of Earth’s bird species. Now take a deep breath. The ‘Lungs of the World’ produces 20 percent of Earth’s oxygen, while storing vast amounts of carbon dioxide, earning it an all-star ‘carbon sink’ status.Why’s it called the Amazon? Spanish explorer and conquistador Francisco de Orellana gave it that name after encountering indigenous women of the Pira-tapuya tribe who fought alongside men. The women warriors of the region reminded Orellana of the Amazons of Greek mythology. Today, the Amazon rainforest still sounds almost mythologically powerful—and it is. Yet, all rainforests are fragile biosystems. Worldwide, we lose swaths of these precious environments to agriculture and mining every day. However, the pace of deforestation is slowing as farming methods improve and advocacy efforts build awareness around these rich bio-diverse tropical rainforests. The more we learn about rainforests, the more we appreciate how our own future, and the future of our planet, hinges upon their health.",

The newly arrived wee residents at least prevented further development in the area. For what manner of villain would destroy the forest home of a bunch of garden gnomes? Eventually there were hundreds of gnome figurines, and a roadside tourist attraction was created.Visitors to Gnomesville are encouraged to bring a gnome to add to the population, as long as they write their gnome’s point of origin on a sign or on the gnome itself. More figurines are needed at the site, as a flood in 2018 destroyed many of the statues in Gnomesville.

They create these soft flashes of light as they search for a suitable mate. The glow is produced by a chemical reaction in a firefly’s abdomen. In addition to attracting a partner, the light is believed to deter potential predators by signaling that the insect’s chemical makeup may produce a foul taste or even be toxic. The fireflies in our homepage image were photographed with a long exposure in the Philippines, where fireflies are a popular tourist attraction.

		"description": "Greetings from Glastonbury Tor and St. Michael's Tower in Somerset county of South West England. The tor (a Celtic word for an isolated hill) is often mentioned in Celtic mythology, and some believe it to be the site of Avalon, a mythical island central to legends of King Arthur. Glastonbury Tor has other enduring spiritual associations as well, particularly to various neopagan beliefs. Archaeological evidence suggests that several buildings have been constructed at the top of the hill over many centuries, but all that remains today is the roofless tower of St. Michael’s Church, built in the 1300s.Glastonbury Tor may dominate the surrounding coastal plain, but it isn't visible from the nearby Glastonbury Festival, which begins today and runs through Sunday, June 30. Since 1970, music fans have turned the Glastonbury area into an outdoor bacchanalian summer retreat as they converge on the area to watch some of the world's most popular pop and rock musicians perform live at the festival. Most summers, the farmland around the village of Pilton—including festival-creator Michael Eavis' Worthy Farm—is transformed into the largest greenfield festival in the world, with more than 100,000 people attending and camping in the area. In an homage to the area’s most enduring feature, the festival's official artwork this year is a representation of Glastonbury Tor and its tower under a full moon, surrounded by red clouds.",

		"description": "Living root bridges like this can be found in the tropical rainforests of Meghalaya, a state in northeast India that is among the wettest places on Earth. The gentle waterways that flow through the region’s valleys become gushing torrents during the summer monsoon season and will wash away traditional bamboo bridges. So, generations of indigenous Khasi people have devised a way of building root bridges by shaping living trees, like this one near the village of Mawsynram.It works like this: Rubber fig trees are planted or located on opposite riverbanks. As the trees' above-ground roots grow, the Khasi will guide them across the water, sometimes with the support of temporary scaffolding like bamboo. After years of tending, the roots will eventually join and take hold of each other, forming a living suspension bridge that provides safe passage over the swollen river. The innovation has proved critical to the Khasi people. In this environment, bridges made from harvested materials would quickly rot and fall apart, leaving villages cut off and isolated. Building a living root bridge requires patience, though. It takes about 15 to 30 years to grow one sturdy enough to support humans. But the investment pays off. As these bridges age, they get stronger. Some are 100 feet long and can hold over 50 people.",

The camera obscura could project an image but didn’t leave a lasting one.In the 1800s, several inventors made advances toward producing an image on a piece of paper or sensitized plate. They also experimented with various lenses. In 1884, George Eastman patented the first film in rolls, and a few years later introduced the Kodak Black camera. These days, of course, just about everyone carries around a digital camera in their phone, documenting everything from major life events to their latest sandwich. So get in the spirit of the day and snap a selfie, a picture of your pet, or anything for National Camera Day.",

Therefore, periodically, when the sun, moon, and Earth are aligned just right, the moon can perfectly obscure the sun as seen from the surface of Earth in a total eclipse. But, unlike the sun, the moon is not a smooth sphere; therefore, in the last few moments before the eclipse reaches totality, we see Baily's Beads. In 1836, English astronomer Francis Baily was the first to explain that the phenomenon is created by sunlight passing between the mountains and through the canyons of the moon. Some folks also refer to it as the diamond ring effect. But whatever you call it, it’s undeniably brilliant.",

This tradition survives today as the Tynwald, the island’s tricameral parliament.

The renovated path is far less dangerous than the original, which for many years had no guard rails. Made for workers back in 1905, the first walkway provided access between El Chorro and Gaitanejo hydroelectric power plants. After King Alfonso XIII visited in 1921, the walkway was given its nickname, El Caminito del Rey (The King’s Little Pathway). But after years of use and lack of upkeep, the nickname was updated to ‘The world’s most dangerous walkway.’By 2001, the trail was closed, riddled with holes, crumbling cement, and gaps where entire sections were missing. Luckily for thrill seekers, El Caminito del Rey is no longer off limits. In 2015, after extensive renovations, one of Spain’s most beautiful (and thrilling) hikes is again king-worthy, and open for all.",

		"description": "This time of year is nesting season for leatherback sea turtles in the Atlantic. After mating at sea, these big mamas—leatherbacks are the largest of all turtles—haul themselves up onto beaches in the same region where they were born. The turtles dig out nests in the sand and lay a clutch of about 80 fertilized eggs the size of billiard balls. They'll repeat this ritual a few more times before returning to their migratory lives in the open ocean. About 65 days later, turtle hatchlings will start to poke up through the sand and make a dash toward the safety of the sea. But the odds are against them: Only 1 percent of the hatchlings will live to reach sexual maturity, at around 16 years old.The leatherbacks on our homepage today are in Trinidad and Tobago. The protected beaches of this island nation compose one of the most important nesting areas in the world for this endangered turtle. Scientists believe there are between 34,000 and 36,000 nesting females left worldwide, a big drop since 1980 when estimates put their population at about 115,000. (Male leatherbacks spend their entire lives at sea, so their numbers are harder to track.) Loss of habitat, fishing bycatch, and egg poaching are all blamed for the decline. The populations in the eastern and western Pacific are most at-risk for extinction, while the numbers of the Atlantic subgroup have stabilized in recent years.",

Jane’s Carousel was built in Idora Park in Youngstown, Ohio, a steel city.Like many carousels produced in that time, the ride eventually fell into disrepair. It was damaged in a fire and Idora Park closed to the public in 1984. That’s when New York couple Jane and David Walentas bought it for $385,000 at auction and shipped the carousel to Brooklyn for a waterfront restoration project. The carousel was painstakingly restored over a period of 27 years—a project overseen by Jane herself. It’s now housed in a glass ‘jewel box’ pavilion designed by Pritzker Prize-winner Jean Nouvel at Brooklyn Bridge Park. The cost of the entire project totaled $15 million—a testament to the love that Americans have for these nostalgic rides.",

Musicians are gathering here this weekend to celebrate and blow these enormous traditional horns of the Alps. No one really knows the origin of the alphorn. We do know that for centuries, European mountain folks from the Alps and east to the Carpathian Mountains used this horn to signal to each other across great distances and to call in animal herds. Even though the horn has no valves or keyholes, it’s not easy to play and requires great lung power.Along with the Tibetan horn, the Australian didgeridoo, and South American erkencho, the alphorn shares the distinction of being one of the world’s original wooden wind instruments. Its design remains relatively unchanged over the past several centuries. Instrument makers once selected pine trees with crooked trunks that allowed them to craft the alphorn's curved sound cup from a single piece of wood. Nowadays, alphorns might be made of carefully joined pieces of a variety of woods, but it’s a serious infraction to compete with one not made entirely of wood. Best of luck to those competing for prizes at this year’s Alphorn Festival—may you blow your horns loud enough for us to enjoy here in North America.",

The journey to build the obelisk was long and arduous, including a 23-year gap in the construction. According to Mark Twain, the incomplete monument looked like ‘a factory chimney with the top broken off.’ On this day in 1876 the Washington Monument was accepted into the National Park System, and today it’s one of the most recognizable buildings in the US.The monument has been closed for repairs since 2016. It’s scheduled to reopen this month.",

Historically, the range of this cat-sized fox stretched across the short grass prairies of Canada down through the central US to the Texas Panhandle. But as agriculture and settlements overtook open grasslands, swift fox numbers declined precipitously. By the 1930s, they had completely disappeared from the wild in Canada.That changed in the '90s, when programs to reintroduce the swift fox in Alberta and Saskatchewan began to see some success. Over the next decade, the small population became self-sustaining and its listing was upgraded from extirpated to endangered in Canada. Today there are an estimated 560 swift foxes living along the Alberta and Saskatchewan border and just shy of 100 in Grasslands National Park. What does this fox say? It's good to be home.",

The park includes 21 islands which, if you’re willing to transport your own gear, offer uncrowded camp sites because, well, they’re islands. Once you’re in a kayak, you can explore some of the red sandstone sea caves, which are best appreciated from the water.And yet, like many wild and rugged places that offer superlative views, be warned before venturing out. This is Lake Superior, the largest, deepest, roughest, and coldest of the five Great Lakes. Even on warm summer days, the water barely rises above 50 degrees, and the winds can be as fierce as any sea. So if you plan to kayak the Apostles, take care.

He sailed five ships and a crew of more than 230 men down the Guadalquivir, the river in today's image. Magellan wouldn’t have seen this incarnation of Seville’s Triana Bridge, though. It was built more than three centuries after the expedition's return to the city in 1522. While successful in finding a western route to the Pacific Ocean and returning with valuable spices, the feat came at great cost. Only one ship, under the command of Juan Sebastián Elcano, and 17 other crew members completed the global circumnavigation, returning to Spain three years after setting off. Magellan wasn’t among them. He was killed on April 27, 1521, at the Battle of Mactan in the Philippines.Seville and other Andalusian cities will celebrate these milestone anniversaries as part of the 'V Centenario.' For the next three years—the same amount of time it took Magellan's fleet to sail around the world—there will be a slate of activities, including academic conferences, museum exhibits, nautical tours, educational events, and much more, to recognize, detail, and celebrate various aspects of this historic voyage.",

In 1883, Teddy Roosevelt, then a New York State assemblyman, traveled to the North Dakota Badlands to hunt bison. During this trip, Roosevelt fell in love with the cowboy lifestyle and the freedom he experienced. Before heading back east, he became part owner of the Maltese Cross Ranch. A year later he was back in North Dakota and had built Elkhorn Ranch. Life in the West inspired Roosevelt, who began writing books and articles about it. He would go on to establish six national parks and 18 national monuments, greatly increasing the size of the National Park System.At Theodore Roosevelt National Park, the only US national park named after a person, you can see some of the places that helped inspire Roosevelt's conservation efforts. In the park's Elkhorn Ranch Unit, the location of his 'home ranch,' you can experience the same remoteness that he craved. At the South Unit Visitor Center you can see the cabin he used as his home during his first trips to the Badlands, now restored to its original state. And if that's not enough, hours of scenic drives, hiking trails with dramatic views, and wildlife watching are sure to make a visit to the area memorable for any visitor.",

The 151-square mile park, which has helped protect elephants and other African animals since it was established in 1974, is home to about 900 savannah elephants. The African elephants seen here may be enjoying their special day today, but they won’t be jumping up and down to celebrate—they weigh an average of 12,000 pounds, so they stay firmly on the ground.Poaching and habitat loss have decimated elephant populations. In Africa, there are an estimated 350,000 elephants, but there are only about 40,000 Asian elephants alive today, with one in three of those living in captivity. Another depressing statistic: Every day, poachers kill about 100 African elephants for their ivory tusks, meat, and body parts, which is faster than these majestic giants can reproduce. World Elephant Day was established in 2012 to raise awareness of the plight of elephants and prompt action on their behalf.Let's join this parade and do what we can to help them.",

Over the next 13 years, only a handful of additional Ecuadorian horned anoles were found, all males, and each sporting the same long snout that earned its species the nickname ‘Pinocchio lizard.’ So rare and secretive is this anole, that for the next four decades no more individuals were found, and scientists feared the Pinocchio lizard had gone extinct. It wasn’t spotted again until 2004, when researchers glimpsed a female for the first time. She didn’t have a long snout, leading scientists to believe the male’s sword-like appendage is primarily used in courtship (insert your own joke here).",

If you've never taken part in a surströmmingsskiva, the Swedish word for this particular event, you're going to need a bucket of water, some side dishes, and a strong constitution.In April and May, freshly caught herring from the Baltic Sea is quickly brined in just enough salt to keep the fish from rotting. In July, the fermenting fish is canned and stockpiled, but fermentation continues in the can. By tradition—and formerly, by law—the sour herring is considered properly fermented by the third Thursday in August, when the year’s catch makes its premiere. Lovers of surströmming eagerly await this day, when the cans are finally sold and ceremoniously opened—outdoors and often submerged in a bucket of water to reduce the smell. The fish is eaten with flat bread, potatoes, and usually a chaser of strong alcohol or beer. Some say surströmming is one of the most putrid smelling foods on earth. Others, of course, beg to differ, finding it delicious.",

		"description": "On August 16, 1896, two prospectors had their hopes literally pan out when they found a huge deposit of gold along the banks of the Yukon River in Canada’s Klondike region. And with that, Skookum Jim Mason (aka Keish) and his American brother-in-law George Carmack set in motion the Klondike Gold Rush—the richest gold strike in North American history. Because of the remoteness of the find, it would be over 11 months before the rest of the world found out. And it did so in the most dramatic fashion, when the steamers Portland and Excelsior pulled into the harbors of Seattle and San Francisco respectively carrying over one ton of gold (worth more than $1 billion in today's dollars).The news reached the rest of the United States and Canada during a prolonged economic depression, which may help to explain why over 100,000 people (including the mayor of Seattle) quit their jobs and set out for the Yukon with dreams of striking pay dirt. But the trip was harrowing and arduous, and fewer than half of those who set out for the Klondike wound up making it there. Nevertheless, the sudden influx of those who did complete the journey briefly turned Dawson City into the second largest city in Canada...and certainly the most expensive. Eggs cost $3 apiece (the equivalent of $81 today) and salt was literally worth its weight in gold. In the saloons of the boom town, a profit could be made by simply sweeping the floor and collecting spilled gold dust. Most who came lost everything. Today, Dawson City has a population of just under 1,400, making it the second largest city in the Yukon.",

Back in 2009, then-Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack officially recognized this event to help raise awareness about the critical role bees play in the world's ecosystem and give a nod to the beekeeping industry. Around the world, there are over 20,000 species of bees, which include solitary bees, bumblebees, and honey bees. Of these, only honey bees make honey, but all these industrious insects benefit humans by pollinating roughly a third of the crops we eat. Honey bees do most of the heavy lifting. In the US alone, each year domesticated honey bees pollinate about $20 billion worth of crops such as almonds, watermelons, blueberries, and more.Unfortunately, populations of bees and other insects have declined from historic levels due to a variety of factors, such as parasites, pathogens, pesticides, and the loss of habitat. What are some things you can do help bees in particular? Plant bee-friendly flowers, avoid the use of pesticides in your garden, and buy local honey to support beekeepers in your area.

His creation has become a Portuguese national landmark and is praised for the way the pools blend into the landscape from some perspectives, and show a harmonious blend of nature and artificiality from others. The design respectfully floats the pools between the soft sands of the beach and the rocky outcrops that have been here long before 1966, when the project was completed. The shapes of the pools simultaneously follow and oppose the natural lines of the terrain that surround them, a masterful balance that foregrounds the beauty of each, as well as the entirety of the scene Álvaro Siza has helped to set.Of course, pools are for swimming, and locals and visitors flock to Leça da Palmeira for summer fun. The larger saltwater pool is designated for adults and sits close to the ocean. The other pool is located more inland and has an entrance that is fairly low to the ground—a lighthearted signal that this is where young kids can swim. Álvaro Siza built changing rooms and a café here too, with low-walled pathways that are carefully positioned to not only leave the views of the coastline undisturbed, but they follow the right angles to enhance what you see, whether you are headed to grab a bite or take a swim.",

The 4.1-million-acre park is home to about 2,200 brown bears, the largest population of protected brown bears on the continent. In summer and early fall, these normally solitary creatures congregate and wade into rivers and streams to feast on salmon returning home to spawn. One of the best spots for bear watching is Brooks Camp, which offers three platforms built just for this purpose. But it takes some effort to get there—the park is only accessible by plane or boat.So, are these brown bears or grizzlies? That's complicated. In North America, there are several subspecies of brown bears that vary in size and coloring, though they're all members of the same species (Ursus arctos), which can also be found in parts of Europe and Asia. It’s the most widely distributed bear species in the world. 'Grizzly' tends to refer to brown bears that live in the interior of Alaska, Canada, and parts of the lower 48 states. When people refer to ‘brown bears,’ they’re generally talking about bears like these two, which are bigger than most ‘grizzlies’ and roam the coastal areas of Alaska.

		"description": "Today we’re viewing North America’s largest arts and music festival—dust free—from a satellite lens. Welcome to Black Rock City, the pop-up home of Burning Man, a raucous event that takes place in late summer each year on the sun-scorched alkali flats of Nevada’s Black Rock Desert. It’s an unusual set-up, a counterculture mecca where gifts reign supreme and money has no value.Festival goers are called Burners in honor of the massive wooden effigy of a man they build each year, only to be set ablaze on the penultimate eve of the event. The 70,000 attendees may come as individuals or entire communities. Many plan months in advance to construct grandiose installations, fantastical floats, art cars, and other creative expressions that defy the logistical constraints of the harsh desert landscape. To do this they must pack in everything they’ll need for nine days, with the full knowledge that it must all be packed back out again. Any litter left behind is considered MOOP (Matter Out of Place), so glitter and other things difficult to retrieve from the desert floor are forbidden. Once inside, goods and services can’t be bought; however, volunteering and gifting are expected. Part of the mission behind Burning Man is to build a creative and connected community.",

After the Queen's Hall was destroyed by a bomb during the Blitz, the Proms moved here to the Royal Albert Hall in 1941. This year marks the 125th festival and includes 150 concerts and educational events.

		"description": "Over two days in late August 1883, Krakatoa—an uninhabited island near Indonesia—experienced one of the most destructive volcanic eruptions of modern times. Ten times more powerful than the eruption of Mount St. Helens, it obliterated all but a third of the island and triggered massive tsunamis. The biggest blast could be heard 3,000 miles away—it’s still the loudest sound ever recorded. More than 36,000 people lost their lives, and the explosions impacted the entire world for years: Global temperatures dropped and skies darkened, causing huge crop failures. Sunsets turned a vivid red and the moon often appeared blue or green after the event due to the volcanic debris circling in the atmosphere.The volcano we’re featuring today emerged from the ruins of the giant that exploded on this day in August 1883. Anak Krakatoa, or ‘child of Krakatoa,’ began to rise in 1927. Though it has yet to be as destructive as its predecessor, the juvenile volcano is highly active, and a collapse of the lava dome in December 2018 caused a massive tsunami, a reminder of just how dangerous this part of the world remains.",

Bruce Springsteen has played here regularly since the 1970s, performing everywhere from the Stone Pony, an iconic music venue, to a benefit show at Asbury Lanes, a bowling alley that was in dire need of sprucing up. Springsteen, who grew up near this stretch of the Jersey Shore, clearly finds Asbury Park special—the name of his 1973 album inspired our title for today’s homepage image. But the seaside resort’s rich musical history predates the Boss—a building boom in the 1920s brought sounds of jazz, gospel, and rhythm and blues to the many clubs here. Musicians Arthur Pryor, Count Basie, and many others developed strong ties to Asbury Park and helped establish its reputation as a showcase for great American music.The tradition continues today with a ‘Jams on the Sand’ summer concert series, which ends this evening, and plenty of other events around town. Whether sunning at North Beach or taking in a show, be sure not to miss other attractions like the famed boardwalk. There’s also the Carousel House, a renovated Beaux-Arts landmark.",

August is the most popular month for state fairs, though a handful are in July, and some southern states have them during cooler months. Fairs weren't always about rides and outrageously fattening foods, though. Beginning with the first state fair in Syracuse, New York, back in 1841, and long before anyone figured out how to fry a stick of butter, there were celebrations of agriculture and livestock, and those traditions continue. So, when you hit your local fair, don't forget to check out the giant vegetables and costumed llamas before you get in line for the tilt-a-whirl or a deep-fried Snickers wrapped in bacon.",

It's one of 27 frescoes that make up this collection of wall-sized paintings.Rivera spent three months studying at the Ford Motor Company’s River Rouge complex in preparation for this project, making hundreds of sketches before painting a single stroke. The work was started during the Great Depression in 1932, making the perspective all the more meaningful. When it was finished eight months later, the US economy was moving toward recovery. Rivera’s murals remain on display at the Detroit Institute of Arts. Rivera believed the work was his most successful piece and Edsel Ford, who helped commission the paintings, liked it too, saying, ‘I admire Rivera's spirit.

The animals are big, growing up to 12 feet, with tusks that can be as long as 3 feet. Walruses use their tusks to fight and to poke up through the ice.

		"description": "Today marks the start of National Hispanic Heritage Month, a holiday to recognize the vital contributions made by Hispanic and Latino people living in the United States. Why does National Hispanic Heritage Month begin on September 15 and not at the start of the month? The date was chosen because September 15 marks the anniversary of independence for five Latin American countries—Costa Rica, Guatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Honduras—places from which many Latin Americans in the US and their ancestors have immigrated. The monthlong celebration is marked with events throughout the country, from an annual festival in Fayetteville, Arkansas, to ceremonies within all branches of the US military.The Smithsonian Institution also holds special events during Hispanic Heritage Month—in 2012, the Smithsonian featured an exhibit of this colorful VW Beetle, called the Vochol, at the National Museum of the American Indian in honor of the holiday. The word ‘Vochol’ combines the popular term in Mexico for the Beetle (Vocho), and Huichol, the name of an indigenous people of western Mexico, members of which turned this car into a modern take on their traditional artwork. Beadwork like this reflects Huichol culture and has long been considered an expression of Huichol spiritual faith. The patterns are created with colored beads, traditionally made from bone, clay, stone, coral, turquoise, pyrite, jade, and seeds.The Vochol is covered by more than 2 million ceramic and glass beads affixed with pounds of resin and arranged in geometric patterns, with references to deer and other revered animals. Two Huichol families worked together for more than 9,000 hours to create it. Since it was unveiled in December 2010, the car has become something of a celebrity. It has its own website and went on tour throughout Mexico, the US, Europe, and Canada, and has been displayed in several museums alongside other important works of art.",

The statue's tablet has the date of the signing of the Declaration of Independence (July 4, 1776) inscribed in Roman numerals: JULY IV MDCCLXXVI.So why is today both Constitution Day and Citizenship Day? The reason is rooted in the World War II era. In 1940, Congress created I Am an American Day, a demonstration of US patriotism. Twelve years later, President Harry Truman signed into law Citizenship Day, which replaced I Am an American Day and moved the observance to September 17, the day the Constitution was signed in 1787. Eventually, in 2004 the day was designated as the mash-up of observances we have today—the jointly celebrated Constitution Day and Citizenship Day.",

		"description": "That’s the Villarrica volcano providing fireworks for our observance of Chile’s Independence Day celebrations—called Fiestas Patrias—taking place September 18 and 19. The second-most active volcano in South America, Villarrica is known to the indigenous Mapuche people as Rucapillán (Devil’s House). The eruption shown in this photo, which was taken on September 2, 2018, alarmed nearby residents, but it wasn’t nearly as destructive as other relatively recent eruptions, like one in 2015 that prompted authorities to evacuate thousands of people.Chile’s Fiestas Patrias take place each year just before the spring equinox in the Southern Hemisphere, so the Independence Day celebrations double as a kind of spring festival. With most schools and workplaces on a weeklong vacation, people observe the holiday by attending rodeos, going to the beach, visiting family, and—above all—indulging in traditional Chilean food and drink. It’s said that Chileans gain 10 pounds or more during the Fiestas Patrias. Most gorge themselves on empanadas de pino, which are small pastries filled with minced beef, sautéed onions, hard-boiled eggs, olives, and sometimes raisins. The empanadas are typically eaten with a variety of grilled meats from barbecue stands called asados. It’s all washed down with local red wine or chicha, which in Chile is a sweet, distilled grape- or apple-based beverage that is almost exclusively drunk during the week of Fiestas Patrias celebrations.",

As temperatures cool, the protected area becomes a birder's paradise while migrating flocks stop over on their flights south. The Superior National Forest’s 3.9 million acres and 2,000 lakes offer the right combination of water, woods, and wetlands to support over 155 species of birds, the most avian diversity found in any US national forest.The common loon holds a special place here. It's the state bird of Minnesota and its haunting hoots and wails serve as lead vocals on the soundtrack of the North Woods. These skilled swimmers live mostly in the water and can dive 200 feet in pursuit of fish. They're impressive in the air, too, reaching speeds of 70 mph. But to get aloft, loons need a long runway of open water. Flapping their wings like mad, they run on the water surface for up to a quarter mile to get the oomph needed for liftoff.",

At first glance, visitors likely see a massive grove of quaking aspen trees, their leaves dancing in the wind. But Pando is not many trees; instead, it's a single organism. Like many aspen groves, the 40,000 trees in Pando are genetically identical cloned stems that sprouted from the same root system. First discovered in 1968, Pando made waves in the scientific world. It's become recognized as one of the heaviest known organisms—weighing 6,000 metric tons—and one of the oldest known living organisms. Scientists estimate its root system is upwards of 80,000 years old, having endured the last ice age and countless forest fires. It got to be so old partly because most of the organism is protected underground. So, while an individual stem can die, the organism as a whole survives.It's only recently that human activity has threatened Pando’s health, with drought, grazing, and fire suppression interfering with its growth. ‘Pando’ translates as 'I spread out' in Latin, a reference to the way it extends itself through cloning. But its delicate, fluttering leaves—which turn golden this time of year—have lent it another moniker: the Trembling Giant.",

It got its beginnings in 1687 when Barcelona was suffering from a plague of locusts. In desperation, city officials voted to ask for the assistance of La Mare de Déu de la Mercè (the Virgin of Mercy). Eventually, having been delivered from the pestilence, the officials named the Virgin of Mercy the patroness of Barcelona, and an annual festival has been celebrated in her honor in the city ever since.These days, the multiday celebration is considered a farewell bid to the warmer days of summer. Attracting nearly 2 million people, the event is known for its street theater, castells (human towers), dancing, musical performances, light projection show, and daily street parades with mythical characters and traditional drumming. At the end of the festival, attendees come out in droves for the pièce de résistance—a musical fireworks display known as the ‘piromusical.’",

		"description": "In the canopy of Uganda's Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, a mountain gorilla leans into a meal of succulent green leaves. By day's end, she'll likely eat close to 40 pounds of foliage. Locals call this forest Bwindi, which means 'impenetrable,' but to this mountain gorilla, it's simply home. Like us (and most primates), these gentle giants have opposable thumbs, which makes picking and eating an easy task. Also like us, mountain gorillas prefer hanging out on the ground. In fact, they're known to stand upright and walk short distances with a remarkably human-like gait. We humans share 98 percent of our DNA with gorillas (both the eastern and western species), nearly as much as we share with chimps and bonobos. So yes, even though they have more body hair, we're all hominids.On World Gorilla Day, observed September 24, we celebrate these great apes and support the ongoing work to protect them. While all gorilla species are endangered, only about 1,000 mountain gorillas are still living in the wild, making them critically endangered. It's largely thanks to the pioneering work and selfless dedication of primatologist Dian Fossey that many of us are aware of their plight. Today, gorillas remain plagued by the same threats Fossey witnessed more than four decades ago: poaching, disease, destruction of habitat, and human conflict. But census reports are reassuring; there are signs that the mountain gorilla population is increasing, but conservation efforts are critical to the species' survival.",

Sea otters live mostly in the water and use the thick blades of kelp to anchor themselves as they sleep and to keep their buoyant pups from floating away. Just as the kelp helps otters, sea otters help the kelp, too. They ensure the kelp's survival by eating sea urchins. If sea urchin populations are left unchecked, these spiny vacuum cleaners of the sea destroy kelp forests by munching on holdfasts that tether kelp to the ocean floor. The resulting clear-cut areas, called urchin barrens, are devastating to the overall ecosystem. Kelp forests provide food and safe harbor for hundreds of fish species and other sea creatures. They also remove carbon dioxide from the air, a benefit to us all.This week is Sea Otter Awareness Week, so let's thank these 'Keepers of the Kelp' for gobbling up those sea urchins. Bon appétit!",

He would eventually map the entire New Zealand coastline, including the area here at Marlborough Sounds, a network of ancient sunken river valleys on New Zealand's South Island. The main purpose of Cook's voyage to the Pacific was to sail to Tahiti and observe the transit of Venus across the face of the sun. Only after completing this task did Cook unseal the rest of his orders and learn he was to search the South Pacific for signs of a fabled great southern continent, Terra Australis Incognito. European Renaissance geographers believed this hypothetical southern landmass must exist in order to counterbalance the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.\nCook wasn’t the first European to lay eyes on New Zealand. Dutch explorer Abel Tasman had visited the islands in 1642, and believed them to be the western coast of Terra Australis. Cook’s voyage would lay that notion to rest. With the incalculable help of a Tahitian named Tupaia, who had extensive knowledge of Pacific geography, Cook and his crew built upon Tasman's work, becoming the first expedition to circumnavigate and thoroughly chart New Zealand's North and South Islands.",

Already over 7 light-years across and expanding at a rate of over 4 million mph, the 'bubble' is actually the shock wave created when expanding hot gas (or stellar wind) hits the cold, interstellar gas that surrounds it. The Bubble Nebula was discovered in 1787 by William Herschel. The star inside is living fast and will die young (for a star)—it will likely detonate as a supernova in only 10 to 20 million years. This image was taken in 2016 by the Hubble Space Telescope to mark the 26th anniversary of Hubble's launch into Earth orbit by the STS-31 space shuttle crew. We're showing it to mark the last day of World Space Week, an annual 'international celebration of science and technology, and their contribution to the betterment of the human condition.'",

But it's been drawing increasing numbers of sailors and spectators to Trieste each year. Last year, for the 50th anniversary of the Barcolana, 2,689 yachts raced the course and set the official record for largest sailing race in the world. Featuring a youth sailing race, an open-water swimming race, a night sailing race, music concerts, food and wine tastings, and many other events, the Barcolana offers opportunities for landlubbers and sea dogs alike to enjoy themselves during the regatta.",

The holiday is officially celebrated on the second Monday in October, though many families gather the previous day. The first known Thanksgiving celebration in Canada was organized by English explorer Martin Frobisher in 1578 when he reached Newfoundland. Years later, American loyalists who were faithful to England during the Revolutionary War moved to Canada and brought traditions with them, such as eating turkey on Thanksgiving. As in the US, a Canadian Thanksgiving table is likely to have a horn-shaped cornucopia filled with festive-looking fruits and grains. The menu often includes turkey, but also regional dishes like salmon and Nanaimo bars—a layered chocolate dessert.\nUntil this year, football was also part of the tradition, with the Canadian Football League hosting games every year from 1958 to 2018. For the 2019 season, however, no games were scheduled as the league considers some broader scheduling changes.",

Flying thousands of miles across the open ocean, these dragonflies are known as globe skimmers, which refers to their migratory behavior. Until about 20 years ago, no one knew where they came from. But researchers have since discovered that the dragonflies take advantage of moving weather systems and monsoon rains to make their epic migration across the Arabian Sea from India. From the Maldives, the dragonflies will continue their journey, passing through the Seychelles and then on to East Africa.\nDragonflies were some of the first winged insects to evolve, around 300 million years ago–fossils show they boasted wingspans of up to 2 feet. Today there are more than 3,000 known species of dragonflies. Nicknamed the 'devil's darning needle,' dragonflies can fly straight up and down, hover like a helicopter, and even mate mid-air. And if they can't fly, they'll starve because they only eat prey they catch while flying.",

Plus, Gourdy, the anthropomorphized pumpkin mascot. While California is the leader in the consumer pumpkin harvest, it is only the second-largest producer in the country. Illinois grows approximately a quarter of the 2 billion pounds of pumpkins the US produces yearly, though 80 percent of that ends up as pie filling or other processed products. Pumpkins require between 90-120 days to mature, so most are planted by late May or early June to coincide with our Halloween carving needs.\nWhile carving vegetables into faces is a tradition in many parts of the world, the carving of jack-o'-lanterns around Halloween originated in Ireland in the mid-19th century, using potatoes or turnips. Irish immigrants brought the tradition to the US around the same time and discovered that the native pumpkins were much easier to carve.",

Our adorable tree hugger looks content thanks to its facial mask and the natural shape of its mouth. Spotting one of these slow-moving solitary animals takes a little skill. The thick outer layer of a sloth's coat is an ideal growing medium for green algae, which forms a natural camouflage in the canopy of tropical forests here in northern South America. If you do spot a pale-throated sloth it will likely be enjoying a simple meal of leaves, limbs, and tree buds. Because sloths don't have incisors, they spend most of their waking hours smacking their lips together 'to chew' their food. This would drive most animals to starvation (if not culinary madness), but the sloth's metabolism is so slow that it's evolved to survive on less food.\nOur happy pale-throated sloth hangs out in the trees of Sloth Island (yes, that’s a real place). It’s a tiny island on the Essequibo River near the town of Bartica, Guyana. Let's take a cue from the sloth and slow down our own hectic lives during International Sloth Day on October 20.

The collection has grown over the decades to contain some of the world’s most notable examples of impressionist, post-impressionist, early modern, and contemporary art.\nBut the building wasn’t always the revered masterpiece it's considered today. Before it was completed, it spurred controversy because many critics thought the building would overshadow the artwork itself and wouldn’t display paintings properly. Eventually, critics of Frank Lloyd Wright's design were won over once they experienced the building's unique spiral gallery. Wright designed the inside of the building to revolve around one central point, allowing visitors to experience the museum's collection of paintings by taking an elevator to the top and viewing artworks by walking down the descending, central spiral ramp. The floor is embedded with circular shapes and triangular light fixtures to complement the geometric quality of the structure.",

In Celtic culture, crab apples are associated with love and marriage. Supposedly if you throw the seeds into a fire while saying the name of your love, the seeds explode if your love is true.

In October, the bears gather here to wait for the Hudson Bay to freeze over so they can venture out onto the ice to hunt for seals. The annual gathering of polar bears here is a big event for the residents of Churchill. They maintain a hotline for bear sightings and even run a polar bear 'jail' that temporarily holds 'pesky' bears to keep locals (and their food) safe.\nFor visitors who want to see polar bears on the ice floes, Churchill is home base for guided tours in protected tundra vehicles. Called Tundra Buggies, the cars can glide smoothly over ice and snow, providing a rare opportunity to get up close to the bears. Visitors may also spot other animals native to the Arctic, including caribou, foxes, and hares. And after the Arctic safari, when the sun goes down, this is an ideal place to sky-gaze at the northern lights.",

It was built to replace another covered bridge that had been destroyed in a flood. But why even build a covered bridge? In a word, longevity. The roof and walls help protect the timber supports from rot. For comparison, an uncovered wooden bridge lasts an average of 20 years, while the covered variety can reach 100 years or more.\nBut even their durable reputation couldn't withstand our drive toward faster travel—the train, the automobile, and the heavier loads that came with both. When iron and then steel replaced timber as the bridge-building material of choice, covered bridges gradually went the way of the horse and buggy that used to traverse them. Out of about 12,000 covered bridges that were built in the US, only 750 remain today, with a quarter of those in Pennsylvania.",

They mainly live in trees and can be highly social, like the ring-tailed lemurs on our homepage, or live a solo existence like the elusive aye-aye. Lemurs have opposable thumbs and five fingers with fingernails on each hand, characteristics that help secure their spot as members of the primate order of mammals. About 65 million years ago, scientists believe, lemurs drifted on rafts of vegetation from the African continent to the shores of Madagascar. Safe from competition and most predators, lemurs evolved into many highly specialized varieties and now can be found in almost all habitats on the island.\nBut lemurs are under increasing threat from hunting and forest destruction—a threat so great they're considered the most endangered group of primates in the world.

Experts believe their migration starts about 2,000 miles north, in Congo.\nThere are over 1,000 species of bats, but they all fit neatly into one of two categories: microbats or megabats. The straw-colored fruit bat, if you didn't guess, is of the mega variety. They are the most widely distributed of all African fruit bats and have adapted to a variety of habitats. Because their habitat extends to such great distances, straw-colored fruit bats play a critical role as pollinators and dispersers of seeds. They're highly social, too, living in large groups called colonies that can number from the thousands upward to a million. But don't worry, they do not drink blood. For them, fruit is life.",

		"description": "If ever there was an animal that deserved some recognition, it's the bison. Since 2012, National Bison Day has been observed on the first Saturday of November to acknowledge the animal's cultural, historical, and economic significance—as well as its remarkable comeback. Bison were once plentiful in America. Tens of millions strong in the 1800s, they roamed in great herds, helping to diversify and maintain the prairie habitat. They also played an important spiritual role in Native American cultures. Settlement of the American West caused habitat loss and that, combined with overhunting, nearly wiped out the species altogether, until ranchers, conservationists, and politicians teamed up to save them. In 1907, 15 bison from the Bronx Zoo were shipped to a wildlife refuge in Oklahoma to revive the population. Fast forward to today, and around 20,000 bison roam on public lands in the United States. In 2016, President Obama named the bison the National Mammal of the United States.",

		"description": "Welcome to India's largest camel and livestock festival, the Pushkar Camel Fair. Thousands of people travel across mountains and through the Thar Desert to buy and sell livestock and enjoy the carnival-like atmosphere here. The fair offers visitors many diversions, but it's the camels who get top billing. Considered 'ships of the desert,' camels were domesticated by nomads thousands of years ago to carry goods across forbidding landscapes. When well fed and hydrated, a camel can travel great distances without needing water or food, sometimes for weeks. The humps on a camel's back serve a purpose: they're fatty deposits that act as a source of nutrition. Here, on the edge of the Thar Desert, the camel remains a mode of transport for nomads as well as a source for textiles, goods, and sustenance (did you know a camel's milk does not curdle in the desert heat?). The camel is held in such high esteem, the Pushkar Fair even stages camel decoration contests.\nBut there's another reason why people flock to Pushkar. The fair coincides with the holy festival of Kartik Purnima, which occurs during the Hindu lunar month of Kartik. The 8th-century desert town itself is a beauty, with medieval architecture and over 50 whitewashed ghats—stairs that descend into Pushkar Lake. Pilgrims consider the lake water to be holy, especially during Kartik's full moon when they believe their sins can be washed away. Needless to say, with all the pilgrims bathing here, photography is not allowed near the lake during the full moon. However, many shutterbugs opt for a view of the fair from a balloon ride at day's end.",

		"description": "It's harvest time for saffron, the precious seasoning that's mostly grown in Iran, but used in cuisines around the world. Saffron is derived from the saffron crocus, an autumn-flowering plant with purple petals as richly hued as the vivid crimson stigmas (called 'threads') in the center of the bloom. These threads are carefully extracted by hand with tweezers and dried before they're used for cooking. Each flower comes with just three threads, and it takes a lot of them—roughly 75,000 crocuses will yield just one pound of saffron. The entire harvest can last only about a week or two, because that's the short life of the saffron crocus bloom.\nThis time of year, the small Spanish town of Consuegra celebrates the end of the harvest season with a saffron-themed festival. This is home to some of Spain's best-preserved windmills, which traditionally milled the wheat grown in the region. During Consuegra's Festival de la Rosa del Azafrán (Festival of the Rose of Saffron), locals dress in traditional clothing and ceremonially grind some wheat in one of the old windmills. But feasting on regional cuisine is the highlight of the festival, and saffron is at the center of activities, complete with a saffron extracting competition. The contest honors the difficulty of picking the threads from the flower.",

Today marks the 30th anniversary of the fall of the concrete barrier that once obstructed this view.\nAlthough it stood for 28 years, the fall of the wall was sparked on November 9, 1989, when an East German official mistakenly announced a new relaxed travel policy during a broadcasted press conference. Within hours, thousands of hopeful East Berliners rushed the wall, overwhelming border guards who reluctantly opened the checkpoints. Soon Berliners from the East and West were on the wall, joyfully dancing together, breaking off pieces with their hands, hammers, and anything else they could use to crumble the cement. Shortly afterward, the wall finally came down and borders were opened.\nConditions that led to the wall began in the years following World War II, when Berlin was divided into Soviet-controlled East Berlin and the American, British, and French sectors known as West Berlin. Although East Berliners weren't allowed to emigrate, many managed to do so nonetheless, and by 1961, millions had left for life in the West, nearly bringing the East German economy to ruin. It was then, on August 13, 1961, that Berliners woke up to a barbed-wire fence cutting off West Berlin from East Germany, including East Berlin. Within days, East Germany fortified the barbed wire with concrete, eventually reinforcing it with an outer and inner wall, watchtowers, and floodlights, while also extending it 28 miles across the city and beyond. For nearly three decades the wall separated families and entire communities. While it finally came down in 1989, it would be another year before Berlin would be reunified as a single city under the new Federal Republic of Germany.",

Visiting a Healing Field is just one of the ways communities across the country come together for Veterans Day to honor the men and women who have served in the armed forces.\nWhy is Veterans Day on November 11?

Germany and the Allies signed a temporary ceasefire, or armistice. Thereafter this anniversary would be known as Armistice Day and became a federal holiday in 1938. Nine years after the end of World War II, in 1954, Armistice Day was renamed Veterans Day and expanded its scope to honor all military veterans. This year marks the 100th anniversary of the first observance of Armistice Day on November 11, 1919.",

The tiny creatures are usually nocturnal and use their spiky exteriors to protect themselves. Each hedgehog has about 6,000 quills, but the quills aren't poisonous and don't easily detach, like those of the also-quilled (but completely unrelated) porcupine.\nAs cooler winter weather sets in across the Northern Hemisphere, many mammals like this hedgehog are preparing to hibernate. Most hedgehogs begin hibernating in October or early November, and they’ll remain in that state until springtime. During hibernation, an animal's heart rate and breathing slow, and its body temperature drops. Though bears may be better known as hibernating animals, it's more common for smaller creatures—like our hedgehog—to use this winter survival strategy.",

This time of year, with the return of the big-wave season, surfers from around the world are descending on this seaside town with their support teams. Together, they anxiously await the optimal conditions required to create these monster waves, hoping for an opportunity to test their skills and see their names added to the record book.",

The original manuscript, considered one of the world's oldest and finest examples of medieval European book paintings, was brought to the Durham area in the 9th century by monks who had fled their monastery in Lindisfarne, off the coast of Northumberland, to avoid Viking raids. The Lindisfarne Gospels is considered an illuminated manuscript because the book is painted in gold and silver with miniature illustrations and ornate border art.

Steve Martin was joking when his character in 'The Jerk' asked for fresh wine—or perhaps he was talking about Beaujolais nouveau. The red wine, produced in the Beaujolais region of France, is fermented for just a few weeks and requires no barrel aging before it's sold starting on the third Thursday of November. Beaujolais nouveau is a light-bodied red wine, with relatively high amounts of acidity. Located south of Burgundy, the Beaujolais region has a relatively warm climate, so Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, and other famous French grapes don't grow well there. But the fruity Gamay grows vigorously in Beaujolais and is used to make Beaujolais nouveau.\nBeaujolais nouveau hit a peak of global popularity in the 1980s when it was heavily marketed. But as more producers tried to capitalize on it, a backlash occurred in the '90s and early 2000s. In 2001, more than a million cases of French wine—most of it Beaujolais nouveau—were destroyed or distilled into hard spirits due to overproduction, shoddy winemaking, and poor sales. (It couldn't have been stockpiled to be sold later—the wine doesn't age well due to lack of tannins and should usually be consumed within six months.) More recently, supply and demand have evened out and its release is celebrated with parties and festivals.",

Built for speed, the Cutty Sark began its abbreviated career as a tea clipper racing across oceans 'at a clip' (hence the designation 'clipper ship') to deliver the season's first tea harvest from China to England. While at times considered one of the fastest ships in the world, the Cutty Sark’s practical use as a cargo ship was ending almost as soon as it was launched. That's because steamships using the much shorter route through the newly opened Suez Canal were able to deliver the highly anticipated tea harvest faster and more cheaply. In 1883, the Cutty Sark began hauling wool from Australia, but within 10 years steamships also disrupted this business.\nBy 1922, the Cutty Sark was the last clipper ship still in use when it was sold to Wilfred Dowman, who had it restored and turned into a cadet training ship. In 1954, it was docked at Greenwich, England, restored again, and opened to the public. The ship was closed again for the Cutty Sark Conservation Project in 2006 but was damaged by a fire the following year. Fortunately, the original masts and many planks were in storage at the time and the Cutty Sark was able to reopen, fully restored, in 2012, with most of the original features still intact. Today, visitors to the Royal Museums Greenwich can explore all facets of this one-time pinnacle of sailing technology, which is part of Maritime Greenwich, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.",

The book begins by describing the Hindu-Arabic numeral system or 'Modus Indorum’—0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9—and shows how its application could simplify trade and make calculations faster and easier (most of Europe at this time used Roman numerals).\nIn the third section of his book, Fibonacci goes on to describe various mathematical problems, including a thought experiment about increasing rabbit populations that results in the Fibonacci sequence. The sequence is determined by adding the previous two numbers together to establish the next number: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, etc. Since then, mathematicians, scientists, and artists have been studying and applying the Fibonacci sequence and the Fibonacci numbers that make it up. While Fibonacci gets the credit for describing the number sequence, he wasn't the first to discover it. Research published in 1985 posits that ancient Indian mathematicians had been aware of and wrote about the sequence more than a thousand years before Fibonacci's work.",

		"description": "Probably the most recognizable of all the butterfly species, monarchs are helpful pollinators that can be found across the United States and Canada in the summer. But each fall, millions of these orange and black beauties embark upon one of the world's most amazing migrations. The insects make use of air currents to make the long journey south to the mountains of southwestern Mexico, a flight of up to 3,000 miles. Aside from being a staggeringly great distance for these delicate insects to fly, it's also a journey to a place that not one of them has ever been to before. And unlike the many bird species that undertake annual round-trip migrations, these butterflies will never return to the north. Why not? Because the distance and length of the total annual migration cycle is greater than the lifespan of individual monarchs.\nThe monarchs travel here to the mountains of Michoacán, Mexico, in search of a safe, warm place to spend the winter. They huddle together on trees known as sacred firs, which create an optimal microclimate that ensures the temperatures don’t go too high or low. The butterflies will stay here through the winter before starting the cycle all over again in March, when they begin to fly back north. After a relatively short distance, these monarchs will stop to mate and lay eggs on milkweed plants. The eggs will hatch after just a few days, eventually transforming into the next generation of adult butterflies to continue the trek back north. The annual cycle takes four or five generations of monarchs to complete, so the butterflies are following in the path most recently traveled by their great-grandparents (or so).\nHow do they know where to go if they've never been where they're going? Scientists aren't exactly sure, but they think monarchs use the sun as a compass and are compelled to migrate to follow the flowering path of their food source, milkweed.",

These two Highlanders are in a national park in Drenthe province of the Netherlands, but the breed developed by natural selection—only the fittest survived—in the wet and windy Scottish Highlands. The original Highland Cattle Herd Book, which recorded Highland cattle pedigrees, dates to 1885, making Highlanders the oldest registered cattle breed in the world.\nFarmers used to keep their Highland cattle in open-air stone shelters called folds, and that name stuck to these hairy bovines—a group of Highlanders is called a fold, not a herd. Today, you can find Highland folds all over the world, as far north as Alaska and Scandinavia, and down south to Australia. Queen Elizabeth is a fan. She's had a fold on her Balmoral estate since 1953.",

Adult turkeys have some 5,000 to 6,000 feathers, which work kind of like cat whiskers, helping the birds sense their environment. It’s the tom turkeys who have these large tail feather displays—they use them to attract hens. Wild turkeys don't fly far and don't migrate, but they are agile and can cover short distances quickly. They’re also highly adaptable to new environments, ranging throughout Mexico (where they originated) and the contiguous United States, and into several Canadian provinces as well.",

The park sits at the edge of the North Pacific Ocean where frequent winter storms dump the snow that feeds this land of ice. The Harding Icefield crowns the park with at least 38 flowing glaciers—one of which is Exit Glacier. Exit Glacier is known for being one of the most visited of Alaska's glaciers, likely because it’s accessible via the Seward Highway. In mid-November, the road to the glacier closes to cars due to heavy snowfall, so visitors can only get there using snow-friendly transportation like dogsled or cross-country skis.\nKenai Fjords is just one of Alaska's eight national parks, which together boast the nation’s largest glacial system, incredible wildlife viewing, and North America’s tallest peak, Denali. These parks exist in part because of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, which President Jimmy Carter signed into law on this day in 1980. It converted massive tracts of Alaskan wilderness into protected land, doubling the size of the entire national park system. For that, we are grateful. Alaska may be cold, but it sure is beautiful and worth protecting.",

		"description": "In honor of Miami Art Week, which is underway right now in Miami, we're looking at a work called 'America's Playground' by New York-based artist Derrick Adams. The installation was featured during 2018's Art Week and was inspired by a 1969 photo Adams found in the Black Archives at the Historic Lyric Theater in Miami. The photo shows African American children at a playground beneath a freeway in Miami’s Overtown neighborhood, a historically African American neighborhood which was nearly destroyed by highway construction in the 1960s. The construction displaced thousands of black residents from their homes, threatening the livelihood of the community. In the late 1960s, city officials and private donors pieced together funding to install a playground under the new overpass. The park was well used for a time, but due to lack of lighting and maintenance, it eventually fell into disuse.\nAdams' work brought the park back to life in a new way. The art installation features a life-size version of the photograph suspended in the middle of a working playground on Miami Beach. One side is black and white, the other is in color, showing the 'vibrancy and promise' Adams saw in the picture.\nContemporary works of art like this can be seen most everywhere you turn in Miami Beach right now, because this is the culmination of Miami Art Week. The annual event kicked into high gear yesterday with the opening of Art Basel Miami Beach, one of the largest art fairs in the US. There are more than 250 galleries participating in Art Basel, and even more fairs, exhibitions, and openings that make up Miami Art Week. The festivities run through the weekend.",

They're joined by survivors who upon their later deaths chose to have their ashes interred alongside their fallen crewmates.\nThe flagpole extends from the battleship's original mainmast, a tradition that predates the memorial itself; naval officers first ran colors up a makeshift pole fastened to the wreck in 1950. The bridge-like permanent memorial, built in 1962, lies directly above the Arizona and is accessible only by boat. It features a roof that arcs downward and back upward along its length, which its architect Alfred Preis said symbolizes America's 'initial defeat and ultimate victory' in the war.

Bad weather neutralized Allied air superiority and over the first few days, the Nazi offensive produced a 'bulge' in the Allies' defensive line west into Belgium. Desperate to hold the line, US General Eisenhower sent the 101st Airborne to defend the strategically important crossroads in Bastogne. The town was surrounded for nearly 10 days by German forces, but the Airborne held out. In fact, a German demand for Allied surrender was rejected with a single word: 'NUTS' (a bit of 1940s American slang that needed to be explained to the Nazi officers). In the end, the German offensive was defeated, with US forces having borne the brunt of the fighting—Americans sustained their highest casualties of any single battle in World War II.\nThis weekend, the town of Bastogne has been celebrating NUTS Weekend, an annual tribute to the soldiers who defended the town in 1944. Festivities include a military parade, a walk around the perimeter, and even the 'Jet de Noix' (throwing of the nuts).",

Cape Town is a popular tourist destination noted for its beaches, natural beauty, architecture, and multicultural diversity—and in that diversity, it's a showcase for the South Africa that Archbishop Desmond Tutu calls the 'rainbow nation.'\nWe're here today in honor of the Day of Reconciliation, a public holiday observed annually on December 16 that's meant to celebrate unity. President Nelson Mandela and the government's Truth and Reconciliation Commission created the holiday in 1995 to heal wounds left by decades of apartheid, South Africa's system of institutionalized racial segregation and oppression. South Africans observe the day with parades and other festivities.",

Both the temple and the festival are dedicated to the agricultural god Saturn, whose reign was associated with a golden age of prosperity and peace. Saturnalia festivities kicked off with a sacrifice at the temple, followed by a public banquet and a week of general merrymaking. Activities included gambling, eating, drinking, and playing music. Businesses and schools closed, and even slaves were free from work and allowed to participate in the festivities. Many Saturnalia customs evolved into Christmas traditions, such as gift giving, decorating homes with wreaths, and drinking spiced wine.",

These markets are generally open-air affairs where everything is decorated, including the trees (called Tannenbaums in German if they're firs). People shop from local artisans who sell their handmade wares in small wooden chalets. Then it's off to eat traditional foods—roasted almonds, pastries, and biscuits—and sip on warm mulled wine.\nToday we're walking through Schwäbisch Hall, a German town that came into prominence during medieval times for its salt production, or 'white gold.' After holiday revelers tire of shopping and dancing in the streets, they can ease into one of the town's many healing spas to end the day.",

On December 19, 1777, about 12,000 soldiers and 400 women and children started to build 1,500 log huts where they would live for the next six months. At the time, the British were occupying the patriot capital of Philadelphia, just a day's march away. Already two and a half years into the war, troops knew the harsh winter would stop the fighting, allowing them to organize and avoid mobilizing for several months. Life, however, was still challenging as they lacked funds for fresh food and clothing. There were no battles at Valley Forge, but nearly 2,000 people died from disease during the encampment.\nWashington's leadership was being questioned by some members of the Continental Congress after losing two key battles, and the encampment gave him a chance to regroup. Some have called Valley Forge the birthplace of the American Army, as concepts like basic training started there. In June, the army left Valley Forge, and while the war wasn't won until 1783, many consider the encampment to be a turning point on the way to victory.",

As older layers of bark peel away in strips, new layers packed with green chlorophyll are revealed. These exposed areas eventually transition to hues of blue, purple, and orange as tannins accumulate. The continual peeling allows the tree to shed mosses, lichen, fungi, or parasites along with the bark, while also exposing the chlorophyll underneath, which boosts the tree's ability to photosynthesize. The bark isn't the only unusual thing about this species. While most people associate eucalyptus with koalas and Australia, the rainbow eucalyptus is native to the Philippines and Indonesia. It thrives in tropical climates like Hawaii, where our homepage trees were photographed.",

Enter Wilson 'Snowflake' Bentley.\nA farmer and self-trained scientist from Jericho, Vermont, Bentley was the first person to successfully photograph an individual snowflake. Over his lifetime, he would produce over 5,000 different images, a feat that led him to be the first to observe that every snowflake is unique. He backed up his observation with some math and meteorology as well. He understood that snowflakes form as they fall through the sky, and their growth and appearance are shaped by hundreds of changing conditions, from altitude, temperature, humidity, and more. The combinations multiply exponentially until there are more design possibilities than molecules on Earth.",

At first an O'Keefe family inside joke, Festivus was rebranded as a rejection of Christmas-season commercialism and written into a 1997 episode of 'Seinfeld' by Daniel's son Dan. The show introduced such goofy new traditions as the 'Airing of Grievances,' 'Feats of Strength,' and identifying 'Festivus miracles.'\nDaniel O'Keefe originally intended Festivus to commemorate the first date he had with his wife Deborah. And in fact, a first date may be what we're seeing here—gentoo penguins mainly use their signature trumpeting call in mating rituals, not just to vent. Contrary to anti-commercial Festivus spirit, male gentoos frequently rain blows upon each other in scuffles over coveted pebbles, which they use as engagement gifts or to build nests.",

Known in North America as caribou, reindeer are well adapted to live in cold, rugged Arctic regions, like northern Norway where this herd was photographed. They're built to withstand frigid temperatures with the help of thick, dense fur and noses that warm the air before they breathe it in.\nReindeer were introduced to Christmas lore in 1823 with the poem 'The Night Before Christmas.' Written by Clement Moore, the verses paint a picture of a Santa Claus and his sleigh, driven by eight flying reindeer. In 1939, Robert May added Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer to the holiday tradition when his employer, Montgomery Ward, asked him to write a story that the department store could use as a promotion during the busy Christmas shopping season. The short story became popular among children and was later turned into an animated feature. Rudolph even got his own song and eventually became one of the most famous and beloved Christmas symbols. Even though science doesn't support the theory of flying reindeer, you might want to look twice tonight when gazing up at the starry sky—you never know what you might see.",

Then three years later, the vice president of Edison's company, Edward H. Johnson, had Christmas tree bulbs especially made, which he used to decorate the tree in his New York City home. Nevertheless, electric lights didn’t catch on as a holiday decoration among the general public until 1895, when President Grover Cleveland asked that the White House Christmas tree be illuminated by hundreds of multicolored electric bulbs.\nIf you're celebrating Christmas today, we wish you a merry one.",

Over the following week, he watched as the tiny stars (now joined by a fourth) changed their position relative to the planet while remaining beside it. By January 15, he had it figured out: he was observing four moons orbiting Jupiter.\nIt was a discovery that would have profound implications on our conception of the cosmos, providing crucial evidence that Earth was not the center of the universe around which everything rotated. Savvy as well as brilliant, Galileo named the four moons 'the Medicean Stars' after his patron, Cosimo II de' Medici. But over the years, as the influence of the Medici family waned and the influence of the genius from Pisa waxed, they became known as the Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.

Originally a cave, it became an arch in 263 CE when the back side of the mountain collapsed, creating the dramatic opening we see today. You'll have to climb 999 steps to make it to the top, but we promise the view is worth it.",

William and Elizabeth Kent, who donated the land, insisted the monument be named after naturalist John Muir, the environmentalist known as the 'father of the national parks.' Part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, Muir Woods is best known for its old-growth coastal redwood forests, which make up more than half its land. The redwoods in the monument are 600-800 years old, on average, with the oldest being at least 1,200. The tallest tree is about 258 feet, though redwoods grow as high as 379 feet farther north. Redwoods are an important part of the forest ecosystem. They absorb and 'strip' moisture from fog, which then drips into the ground, supporting the trees as well as other forest life.",

The Palace, built to be the LN's headquarters, has served as UN headquarters in Geneva and hosts diplomats for thousands of meetings every year.\nAt the end of the Palace's rows of flags is 'Broken Chair,' a sculpture by Swiss artist Daniel Berset. With one leg broken off, the piece conveys opposition to land mines and cluster bombs, and was originally placed there in 1997 ahead of a vote on the Ottawa Treaty on land mines. It was later dedicated and given to Handicap International (now known as Humanity & Inclusion), which aims to help people with disabilities and vulnerable people in situations of poverty, exclusion, conflict, and disaster.",

Some believe this gift-giving is based on a children's folk story of an elderly hatmaker who was unable to make it to market on a snowy day, so he placed his collection of hats on rakan statues to keep their bare heads dry. Later, the statues showed their appreciation by delivering gifts to the hatmaker and his wife so they could celebrate the new year properly. The statues in this photo were individually carved sometime between the 1780s to the 1820s, and no two are alike.

In fact, this is one of the best viewsheds in the Bay Area, which is a feat, since the peaks are comparatively low for the region. While Mount Diablo may tempt you to take in the scenery or hike in the surrounding state park, the area offers compelling stories from American history as well.\nOn November 4, 1841, a group of about 70 people, led by 22-year-old John Bidwell, finally reached the West Coast after having set out from Missouri. This was the first time a wagon train used part of the newly established California Trail to emigrate to California. The trip was grueling, covering more than 2,000 miles. The wagons traveled at a pace of just 15 miles per day, pulled by oxen, horses, or mules. The journey required traversing part of the Oregon Trail and crossing such daunting obstacles as the desert areas around the Great Salt Lake and the steep slopes of the Sierra Nevadas. After five months, the wagon train arrived at the ranch of John Marsh near Mount Diablo. The successful journey helped pave the way for expansion to the American West and marked the route for future wagon trains during the California Gold Rush.",

When winter ends, the muskoxen shed this undercoat, which is collected and spun into yarn that's warmer than sheep's wool and softer than cashmere—pricier, too.\nMuskoxen, named for the strong odor the males emit during the rutting (mating) season, have roamed the tundra eating roots, mosses, and lichen for thousands of years. In the 1920s, they were hunted almost to extinction, and were totally wiped out in Alaska.

It's similar to the winter solstice celebrated by other cultures. Typically, people observe the holiday at home with their families.

The dune field became a national monument on this day in 1933 with a proclamation by President Herbert Hoover, which set aside nearly 150,000 acres for preservation. Recently, on December 20, 2019, President Trump signed legislation making it the 62nd designated national park in the National Park System.\nThe pearly sands compose the largest gypsum dune field in the world but cover just a fraction of southern New Mexico's Tularosa Basin. About half of this vast desert valley is occupied by White Sands Missile Range. The active military installation—the US's largest by area—surrounds the national park and includes the Trinity nuclear test site, where the first atomic bomb was detonated in 1945. That event altered the course of humanity's future, but the White Sands region is also defined by echoes from our very distant past: recently, scientists have used radar technology to zero in on prehistoric human, mammoth, and giant sloth footprints buried long ago beneath the shifting sands.",

It also has a habit of burying caches of food for later consumption—and even 'pretending' to bury food to mislead other animals that might be watching. But squirrel brain capacity being what it is, the squirrel inevitably forgets where some of the food has been buried.

So, the Gregorian new year always falls on January 1, while the lunar new year date moves around from year to year. Either way, we're excited to have another excuse to throw a party.\nThe Chinese New Year also comes with a turn of the zodiac, which is divided into 12 parts, with each part represented by a different animal. Instead of all 12 animals appearing simultaneously, the zodiac system assigns a single animal and its attributes to represent each year, and 2020 is the Year of the Rat.

As it stalks its prey in shallow water, the reddish egret is prone to prance, stagger, and leap, while strategically positioning its wings to block the glare of the sun and boldly stab at fish. It's one of many species that make Florida a year-round delight for birdwatchers.\nOur homepage egret was photographed at Fort De Soto Park, a gateway site for the Great Florida Birding Trail, a collection of more than 500 sites where bird habitat is protected. During wintertime, many migratory bird species fly south to Florida where they join year-round residents like the reddish egret, making winter an especially fruitful season for birders to travel the Great Florida Birding Trail.",

		"description": "To mark the beginning of Black History Month, we're visiting a highlight of Philadelphia's famous Mural Mile. The larger-than-life figure depicted on the left in this mural is W.E.B. Du Bois, trailblazing scholar, sociologist, author, and co-founder of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. It was here, in Philadelphia's Seventh Ward neighborhood during the late 1890s, that Du Bois conducted a comprehensive study of an African American community. He used methodologies—including detailed data visualizations—that were decades ahead of his time, mapping out every household and documenting the challenges that residents encountered as they tried to achieve success and happiness in the decades after Reconstruction and the dawn of the Jim Crow era.\nIn 1899 the University of Pennsylvania Press published the results of Du Bois' study, 'The Philadelphia Negro,' now considered a classic in social science literature. Look closely at the mural and you'll see Du Bois again as a younger man standing among residents at the former home of Engine #11, Philadelphia's first African American firehouse. The mural is just one of dozens of public art projects that Philadelphia Mural Arts produces each year. The works engage local communities by beautifying neighborhoods while drawing on shared experiences and contributions. We think Du Bois would approve.",

		"description": "Roam around tiny, remote Easter Island and you'll find almost 900 of the stern stone faces called moai. They seem ancient as the pyramids, even a little alien, but they were actually sculpted between 500 and 800 years ago from compacted volcanic ash that's as terrestrial as it comes. You're seeing six of the 15 moai that stand on Ahu Tongariki, the largest ahu (stone platform) on the island. These statues were toppled in the 18th or 19th century along with other moai island-wide for reasons not fully known to scholars, though earthquakes or possible tribal infighting are postulated. The statues were later buried by a tidal wave and lay in ruins until the 1990s, when they were excavated and placed back on the ahu.\nThough scholars still debate how and why the moai were constructed and moved into place, it's known that they represent the ancestors of the Rapa Nui, an isolated and hardy culture that still celebrates its uniqueness. Visit Easter Island during the first two weeks of February and you'll find yourself in the midst of Tapati Rapa Nui, a festival that revives islander ceremonies of song and dance, as well as sporting events like ocean canoeing, horse racing, and haka pei (high-speed sledding on banana tree trunks).",

In winter, the lake draws nature photographers interested not just in the wildlife and spectacular landscape, but also the lake's odd appearance when it freezes over. Bacteria on the lake bottom feed on dead organic matter and release the methane bubbles you see here. When the surface water freezes, the bubbles get trapped, creating a photographer's dream. They may be beautiful, but these frozen bubbles can be dangerous because they're highly flammable. If you happen to be lighting a match nearby, you'll want to watch out or the released methane could explode. The bubbles aren't so friendly to the environment, either; methane in the atmosphere is a major part of global greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change.",

But within a few years, as the silent-film era gave way to 'talkies,' the sign evolved into a popular tourist attraction. Falling into disrepair in ensuing decades—at the peak of its decay, the sign was missing its third 'O' altogether—the original was demolished and a sturdier version built in 1978.\nThough it's inspired similar designs advertising locales from Ireland to Taiwan to the fictional Simpsons' hometown of Springfield, the now-permanent Hollywood Sign is cherished by residents as uniquely LA.

Darwin is best known for his theory of evolution by natural selection, which he published in his 1859 book 'On the Origin of Species.' During his travels to the Galápagos Islands years earlier, Darwin observed creatures that were similar from island to island but had slightly different adaptations to better survive in their specific environments. This became a key component of his research. The islands are home to thousands of unique species, including this Pinzon Island tortoise, which we see hatching from an egg at the Charles Darwin Research Station.\nThese tortoises were once at the brink of extinction in the wild due to several factors, including centuries of capture by humans and predation by invasive rats. But thanks to conservation efforts at the Charles Darwin Research Station on Santa Cruz Island in the Galápagos, they're beginning to successfully hatch in the wild for the first time in more than 150 years.",

It's just part of what makes Abiqua Falls so spectacular.\nThe waterfall is on the grounds of Mount Angel Abbey, a Benedictine monastery formed in 1882. The monastery now houses a seminary, library, retreat center, and very successful brewery. Monks and brewing have a long tradition together, with medieval monks being credited with developing the first true breweries as early as the 9th century. Lest you think the monks were just looking for a little buzz, remember that beer was such a common drink back then because water was often polluted or carried disease.",

The pilgrims in today's image are releasing prayer flags called 'wind horses' or lungtas, a ritual they perform for Losar and during the rest of the year as well. Upon releasing the prayer flags, the pilgrims ask the mountain deity to 'increase their fortune like the galloping of a horse and expand their prosperity like the boiling over of milk.'",

As Carnival season culminates today with Mardi Gras celebrations throughout the city, this historically black neighborhood adjacent to the French Quarter will come alive with the music of jazz bands like the one depicted here. The sculptural profile of a traditional marching brass band marks one entrance to Louis Armstrong Park, a community space honoring New Orleans' musical roots with a 12-foot statue of its jazz legend namesake, as well as other art pieces depicting iconic NOLA musicians.\nThe park is just one of many tributes to the city's complicated past as a cradle for African American creativity, and if you're in town for Mardi Gras you owe yourself a visit. But figure out that itinerary fast, because Lent is coming—and that means six-odd weeks of fasting and austerity for the pious, although we're sure plenty of this fun-loving city's denizens intend to keep the good times rolling.",

Also known as parachute frogs, these critters live in the tropical jungles of Malaysia and Borneo. They spend most of their time in trees, gliding down to the ground to mate and lay eggs. They 'fly' by leaping and using their webbed fingers and toes to glide as far as 50 feet.\nLeap years keep our calendar (the Gregorian calendar) aligned with the Earth's revolutions around the sun. The concept was first introduced by Julius Caesar. People often refer to a calendar year as a 'trip around the sun,' but that trip takes longer than the 365 days of a typical calendar year. It really takes 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, and 45 seconds. Adding an extra day every four years solves the problem—almost. To keep our calendar mostly synchronized with the astronomical year, some further adjustments need to take place. Years that are divisible by 100 are not leap years unless they're divisible by 400. Yeah, it's confusing, and we haven't even mentioned leap seconds, but that's a topic for another day.",

		"description": "The fantastical 'fairy chimneys' found in central Turkey's historical Cappadocia region were formed by a collision of the natural and the man-made—and they form a scene that seems straight out of a Dr. Seuss illustration. The landforms were created when volcanoes deposited mounds of soft, porous rock called tuff, which was later covered with hard basalt. In the 10th century (though possibly starting up to 5,000 years ago) humans excavated the tuff to create caves and catacombs that could fit thousands of dwellers. Through not only the astonishing ruins but the many 'cave hotels' hewn into rock in the city of Göreme, the memory of those ingenious city planners lives on.\nBut in fact, it's the memory of Dr. Seuss that brings us here today. On March 2, 1904, Seuss—real name Theodor Seuss Geisel—was born in Springfield, Massachusetts. The children's book creator—known for his quirky, bombastic poetry and fantastical pen-and-ink landscapes—passed away in 1991, but his birthday is still observed as a yearly celebration of literacy for kids and 'obsolete children' (as Seuss classified adults) everywhere.",

The flowers form only at the top of the plant and the tips of branches. The blooms are striking enough to be honored as Arizona's state flower.

This year’s Women's Day observance is particularly meaningful in the United States because 2020 marks 100 years since American women won the right to vote nationwide. That victory was the result of a long, difficult struggle by suffragists—women who faced ridicule, slander, imprisonment, and outright brutality for their efforts to claim the right to vote. These women often drew inspiration from Joan of Arc, who became a feminist symbol of the female warrior for universal rights. In their marches and demonstrations in the early 1900s, suffragists often dressed as Joan and invoked her heroism in defiance of a male-dominated culture.\nArtist Anna Hyatt Huntington surely thought to harness some of this feminist righteousness in choosing Joan of Arc as the subject for this sculpture. Huntington herself was a trailblazing woman for her era—a successful female artist. In 1910, she first exhibited a version of her Joan of Arc statue at the Salon de Paris, a prestigious art exhibition dating from the 1600s. But she only earned honorable mention because the exhibition's judges didn't think a woman working alone could create a sculpture of that magnitude. Paris' loss is Manhattan's gain, as the city soon commissioned a new Saint Joan for display at Riverside Park. It's stories like this that we enjoy sharing on International Women's Day.",

While in her small den, the bear enters a dormant state, sleeping nearly all the time, until she gives birth, usually between November and February. Then in spring she'll dig herself out and emerge with her recently arrived cubs. Polar bear cubs stay with their mother for about two years as they learn to survive in the Arctic.\nThe cubs in this photo are in Wapusk National Park in Manitoba, Canada, which is known as the 'Polar Bear Capital of the World.'

The scratchy cursive is inked within the script of Anthony Munday's 'Sir Thomas More,' a then-controversial play about a king-defying statesman. In 1603, the censorial Royal Office of the Revels brought in Shakespeare among a team of writers to retool the script. But if Shakespeare's task was to tone things down, he may have had other ideas: His three-page addition includes an impassioned speech by the title character to a mob that's rioting over immigration policy.\nSo, to recap: Shakespeare worked as a script doctor for picky producers and used his writing to chime in on hot-button politics. If that all sounds more 2020 than 1600, remember this: Shakespeare not only shaped literature as we now know it, he originated or popularized many household words of today (including the phrase 'household words,' per some sources). Whether modern times have you 'zany' with 'amazement' or so 'jaded' you're 'puking,' there's a decent chance you have the Bard to thank for your word choices.",

		"description": "Migratory bird species are predictable frequent fliers, taking to the sky to travel along roughly the same route, at the same time, every year. Following sources of food and water along the way, the birds often fly great distances to reach breeding grounds or places to spend the winter. Today, we're looking at an important stopover for migratory birds—California's largest lake, the Salton Sea.\nThis shallow saline lake was formed when a dam broke in 1905, causing the Colorado River to flow into a 35-mile-long basin with extensive salt deposits. Now it attracts hundreds of species of birds in what is considered one of the most significant concentrations of bird life in the continental United States. Most of these birds are just passing through, migrating along the north-south route called the Pacific Flyway. They gather here, sometimes in the millions, to feed and regain strength before moving on. Some birds, like the heron pictured in today's photo, may stay here for the season, but most of those who visit in the spring will stay for just a few days before continuing their journey to a summer spot farther north.",

		"description": "For World Poetry Day, we're seeing the stylized visage of poet Pablo Neruda projected on a building in his native Chile. World Poetry Day was established by UNESCO to acknowledge 'that individuals, everywhere in the world, share the same questions and feelings.' Neruda, a Nobel laureate generally held up by Chileans as their national poet, made his early mark with famously racy love poetry. But his palette of questions and feelings evolved, expanding into surrealism, epic history, and radical politics. His death in 1973 after a bout with cancer was mourned publicly by Chileans—in defiance of newly installed dictator Augusto Pinochet, whom many Chileans link to Neruda's untimely passing.\nUNESCO explains that World Poetry Day celebrates 'one of humanity's most treasured forms of cultural and linguistic expression and identity.' So, if it's been a while since you've read a poem, dust off a volume of verse sitting on your shelf or search online for a favorite poet and rediscover the timeless magic of poetry.",

Most stepwells also feature shaded side chambers where locals (primarily women) can gather to escape the heat of the day.\nIn this image, one can see obvious signs of previous high-water marks on the well's walls as seasonal fluctuations and the changing climate affect water levels throughout the region. The impact of climate change on fresh water accessibility is the theme that the United Nations has chosen for this year's World Water Day. The goal of today's observance is to focus attention and energy not just on those problems, but on potential solutions as well.",

Each year a vibrant forest blooms with hundreds of native and hybrid varieties, including 15 azaleas once thought to be extinct.\nFounded in 1676 as a rice plantation, Magnolia introduced an extensive network of dams and dikes built along the Ashley River for irrigating fields for rice cultivation. These earthworks were created by African slaves from rice-growing regions of West Africa and their descendants. The plantation's historical use of slave labor is something that Magnolia's staff members today try to address through education programs.\nBotanical gardens were an early feature of the plantation; some sections of Magnolia's gardens date back 325 years. In the 1840s, the owner was the first in the US to try planting azaleas outdoors, bringing them south from Philadelphia greenhouses.",

These 'borrowed days' are the last three days of the month. Perhaps take comfort that it's only three days. In some parts of Ireland, March borrowed nine days. That's too many days.",

His son dismantled the fort and rebuilt it as Himeyama Castle in 1346. Two centuries later, that castle was significantly remodeled to become Himeji Castle.

The same order of monks that established France's Mont-Saint-Michel built a church and priory here in the 12th century. In ensuing centuries of war, the insular monastic outpost was fortified into the imposing castle we see today. Privately purchased in 1659, the mount was opened to the public in 1954—and is still managed by members of the family that bought it over 350 years ago.\nThis photo may give the moon a somewhat salmon tint, but the term 'pink moon' doesn't arise from its coloration, nor from any place near the Cornish shores. The April full moon is called the pink moon because Native Americans associated it with the flowering of wild ground phlox, or moss pink, an early sign of spring in eastern North America. The pink moon for 2020 will crest tonight around 10:35 PM EDT, and for extra effect, it's also a supermoon—that means the moon will be full at the same time that it's passing closest to Earth, making it appear larger.",

But this tranquil scene belies the island's explosive geologic history, for this is the site of one of the largest volcanic eruptions in recorded history. The Minoan eruption, about 3,600 years ago, caused the center of the Thera volcano to collapse into the ocean, leaving Santorini a jagged, crescent-shaped moon atop the sea.\nThe impact of the eruption was more than just geologic—when the volcano blew its top, Santorini was home to a thriving outpost of the Minoan civilization. A farming and fishing community had been established at Akrotiri on the island around 7,000 years ago, and by the time of the eruption had developed into a prosperous city built largely on trade with other cultures of the Aegean. Akrotiri had paved streets, delicate pottery, a drainage system, and multistory buildings decorated in elaborate frescoes. Akrotiri's fortunes ended abruptly, however, with the Minoan eruption, which completely buried the city in pumice and ash. Extensive archaeological excavations began in 1967, revealing artifacts that were remarkably well preserved by the volcanic material; particularly notable were the elegant, colorful frescoes. It seems Santorini has always been a site for the beautiful things in life.",

The tusk juts right through the narwhal's upper lip, lending the whale the nickname 'unicorn of the sea.'\nFor centuries, dating back to medieval times, narwhal tusks were sold to gullible buyers as rare unicorn horns with magical powers. These 'unicorn horns' were so prized for their medicinal and healing properties that in the 16th century, Queen Elizabeth I of England paid 10,000 pounds for one (equal to the cost of building a castle back in the day). By the late 17th century, scientific facts started replacing superstitious beliefs and the unicorn horn market went out of favor.\nToday narwhals continue to inhabit deep waters of the Arctic and North Atlantic Oceans, surfacing in the cracks between dense pack ice. Although their conservation status is listed as 'least concern,' their long-term challenges are associated with the loss of sea ice and environmental impacts from oil and gas development.",

Award-winning photographer Christian Vizl captured this serene scene off the coast of Ixtapa, Mexico, where these cetaceans can be, er, spotted in abundance. As their name would suggest, pantropical spotted dolphins live in tropical and subtropical waters around the world. They're the second-most common dolphin after the bottlenose and grow between 6 and 7 feet long. That may seem big if you were swimming next to one, but it's really pretty small compared with the big kahuna of the dolphin family—the orca. Orca bulls can be up to 32 feet long and tip the scales at 11 tons. Let's all take a moment today to spread the love of dolphins big and small and recognize their importance to our ecosystem.

		"description": "Art can seem like a portal to another dimension, as Irish-born artist Laura Buckley shows us in today's mind-bending image. She posed here (and there, and there, and there…) with her mixed-media sculpture 'Fata Morgana' at London's Saatchi Gallery last year. The work is outwardly unassuming, made from a hexagonal wood-frame tube lined on the inside with reflective acrylic and capped on one end with a projection screen. When a viewer enters the installation, the mirrored surfaces reflect their image along with a video projected on the screen, merging the two into a whimsical mirage.\nWe're stepping inside this life-size kaleidoscope for World Art Day. The International Association of Art (IAA) kicked off the idea of World Art Day in 2012, picking the birthday of Leonardo da Vinci, April 15, for the festivities. The occasion—since recognized by UNESCO 'as a means to achieve a more developed, free and peaceful world'—is marked by IAA-facilitated events that support the development of art and look to its future. But if the past is more your thing, try our art history quiz.",

		"description": "The story of this sandstone formation in southeastern Utah's Natural Bridges National Monument begins around 10 million years ago. That's when tectonic shifts began slowly lifting what is now the 130,000-square-mile Colorado Plateau above the surrounding plains. In ensuing eons, the Colorado River's many streams eroded the elevated land, threading it with deep canyons. When water broke through one canyon wall into another canyon, sometimes a natural bridge like this one remained above the breach.\nOn April 16, 1908, President Theodore Roosevelt proclaimed this place a national monument, Utah's first. It protects three major bridges: Sipapu (pictured, and the largest), Kachina, and Owachomo. But even the president's pen can't stop the slow ravages of time. In a 1992 rockfall, Kachina slimmed down by 4,000 tons—and the remains of many fallen bridges dot the monument, hinting at the main attractions' eventual fate.",

They excel at flying in short spurts and are skilled at making sharp twists and turns when navigating through thick deciduous forests. How's that for beauty and brawn?",

On this day in 1970, some 20 million Americans rallied in communities across the nation to raise awareness of environmental issues. The landmark event is credited for sparking passage in the 1970s of the most comprehensive environmental reform legislation in US history, including the creation of the Clean Air, Clean Water, and Endangered Species Acts, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

As you can see, male king eiders have striking multicolored plumage and yellow-knobbed beaks that resemble crowns. They, and the less-ornate brown females, make their home in the frigid waters along the Arctic coasts of northern Europe, North America, and Asia.\nMost of the year, king eiders congregate in large flocks at sea, resting on ice floes, swimming, and diving as deep as 80 feet underwater to feed on crustaceans, mollusks, and other prey. But as the summer breeding season draws near, these ducks will migrate even farther north in smaller numbers to the Arctic tundra, where they'll nest. This row of earnest males was photographed along the northeast coast of Norway, close on the webbed heels of a lovely hen.",

Like its namesake, the great astronomer Edwin Hubble, the Hubble Space Telescope has transformed our understanding of the cosmos. Some of the telescope's greatest contributions include its Deep Field images, which peer back billions of light-years and help astronomers measure the size and age of the universe and test theories about its origin. It's also produced jaw-dropping images of objects closer to home, like the one on today's homepage. Here we're looking at a maelstrom of glowing gas and dark dust within one of the Milky Way's satellite galaxies, the Large Magellanic Cloud.\nNASA estimates that Hubble's mission will continue for another 10-20 years.

This photo of the famous Avenue des Champs-Élysées was taken from atop the appropriately named Arc de Triomphe, looking east toward the distant Place de la Concorde and the Louvre. Victory in Europe (VE-Day) had come at last.\nThe Nazis' unconditional surrender had actually been signed the day before, on May 7, at a ceremony in Reims, France. But a few changes were made, and representatives of the Nazi High Command of the Armed Forces signed it again in Berlin, officially, on May 8. Church bells rang out all over Paris that day, and revelers hugged and cheered in the streets because it was now clear that the battle would not return to their doorstep. But it was a victory half won, as war still raged in the Pacific theater and wouldn't end completely until four months later. That certainly didn't stop the jubilation felt in cities from Paris to London and far beyond 75 years ago today, as the long ordeal in Europe had finally ended.",

The annual celebration honors educators who dedicate their lives to developing the minds of young and old, sparking curiosity and encouraging us to explore and think about the world around us. The celebration has a special significance this year, as teachers facing widespread school closures have quickly adapted their teaching methods, including the extensive implementation of remote learning. We're eternally grateful for their efforts, including the support they've given the parents who are stepping up at home.\nOh, and thanks to the efforts of our teachers, we know that our homepage friend is a barn owl—the most widespread land bird species in the world, found on every continent except for Antarctica.

May 12, 2020 is the 200th anniversary of the birth of Florence Nightingale, the 'Lady with the Lamp' credited with reinventing and modernizing the profession of nursing. Born into a wealthy English family living in Italy, she spurned the traditional Victorian roles of wife and hostess to embark on a career in nursing and social reform. After training as a nurse in Germany and serving as one in London, her friend and confidant, War Secretary Sidney Herbert, sent Nightingale and a staff of 38 women she had trained as nurses to help care for the wounded of the Crimean War.\nWhen Nightingale arrived, she discovered the soldiers were receiving poor care from overworked staff in unhygienic conditions. In the face of this, she pleaded with the government to do more to improve the lot of these soldiers and worked to institute many basic hygiene practices (like handwashing and regular changing of sheets and bandages) that contributed to a precipitous drop in deaths in the hospital. When she returned to England after the war, she pursued a data-driven advocacy campaign to improve sanitation and nutrition in the army, hospitals, and working-class homes. In her later career, she founded the first school of nursing in England, now known as the Florence Nightingale Faculty of Nursing, Midwifery & Palliative Care, and mentored Linda Richards, America's first trained nurse.",

It's the date in 1814 when the Norwegian national assembly enacted the nation's constitution—one of Europe's earliest. Though Norway would be paired with Sweden under a common crown until 1905, the document declared the self-direction of Norway's people, many of whom now celebrate Norwegian Constitution Day's dawning with a traditional salmon-and-eggs breakfast—and maybe a glass or two of champagne.",

If you're seeing brightly colored flowers against a multihued backdrop, you're experiencing something the painter of today's Bing homepage image hasn't fully seen since he was a young boy, before a brain tumor damaged his optic nerve. Today, Jeff Hanson is a successful artist who only vaguely sees shapes and colors. Although legally blind, he's developed a unique tactile process that helps him feel his compositions by first plastering the canvas with a thick plastic goop. Once that hardens, he uses the plastic ridges to navigate a piece, lending the composition form so he can add his signature vibrant color. He playfully calls each painting 'a sight for sore eyes' and sells his art to appreciators like Warren Buffett, Elton John, and other collectors. Yet, one of the most creative aspects of Hanson's life is the way he's had to develop assistive methods to paint.\nThe methods Hanson uses are not unlike the wheelchairs, head pointers, closed captions, voice trackers, and a growing number of assistive technologies that empower other people with disabilities. On Global Accessibility Awareness Day, we're featuring Hanson's painting to observe the ongoing work to make technology accessible for more people around the world.

Just outside Meiringen, Switzerland, the Reichenbach Falls are the backdrop for 'The Final Problem'—the 1893 Sherlock Holmes story where, on a precipice near the falls (which in the 19th century gushed with far more power than our recent image shows), the genius detective enters a death duel with the criminal Professor Moriarty. In the end, both men plummet to their presumed doom.\nThough the action in 'The Final Problem' was set on May 4, it's May 22 that's celebrated as Sherlock Holmes Day since it's author Arthur Conan Doyle's birthday. The doctor-turned-author created Holmes with 'A Study in Scarlet' in 1887 and intended to kill off his famous protagonist in 'The Final Problem' to move on with his literary life. Nonetheless, pressure from Doyle's anguished, sleuth-starved public led him to resurrect Holmes (but not Moriarty) a decade later with 'The Adventure of the Empty House.' In all, Doyle issued four novels and over 50 short stories starring Holmes over four decades—and they've inspired countless other books, plays, radio dramas, movies, TV shows, comics, and video games that feature the supersleuth.",

While it was celebrated independently by various towns across the country in the aftermath of the Civil War, Union General John A. Logan was the first to call for a national day of remembrance on May 30, 1868. Originally called Decoration Day, it was a day set aside for the public to offer prayers and honors for those lost to battle and to decorate their graves with flags and flowers. On the first national Decoration Day, over 5,000 widows, orphans, and other mourners attended a ceremony in Arlington National Cemetery, and placed flowers on the graves of Union and Confederate soldiers interred there. Originally only a commemoration of those soldiers killed in the Civil War, by the end of WWI it had come to be a holiday honoring all American war casualties from the Revolutionary War onward.\nAcross the Potomac River from Arlington Cemetery, the World War II Memorial sits on 7.4 acres in the middle of the National Mall in Washington, DC. It consists of 56 pillars representing the 48 states and eight American territories that contributed men and women to the effort, bas-relief scenes from the war, and the Wall of Freedom, a detail of which we feature today. The wall is studded with 4,048 gold stars, each representing 100 Americans who lost their lives in service during the war. It also bears a plaque that reads, 'Here we mark the price of freedom.'",

Afternoon thunderstorms are common, bringing heavy rainfalls that subside quickly. The largest subtropical wilderness in the US, the Everglades is essentially a slow-moving river, 60 miles wide and over 100 miles long. The water flows during the wet season from Lake Okeechobee southward across a limestone shelf to the southern tip of the Florida Peninsula. The complex ecosystem here is not found anywhere else on the planet.\nNicknamed the 'River of Grass' by conservationist Marjory Stoneman Douglas, the Everglades wetland is full of sawgrass marshes, cypress swamps, and mangrove forests. In the early 20th century, water flow from Lake Okeechobee was increasingly diverted to support the development of South Florida, and it became clear that the Everglades were quickly vanishing. To help protect the fragile ecosystem, Everglades National Park was established in 1947, preserving about 20% of the original wetlands. While rising water levels can make it challenging to spot wildlife during the wet season, it's a critical time for the birds, crocodiles, manatees, and many more beautiful creatures that call the River of Grass home.",

Over the centuries, some of history's most notable explorers have been drawn to the winding waterway: Ferdinand Magellan's 1520 expedition discovered its coastal delta, and Charles Darwin (on the same voyage that took him to the Galápagos Islands) studied the area's ecosystem during a grueling 1834 side trip up the river. Even now, very few settlements exist along the 240-mile course of the Santa Cruz, considered the last major free-flowing river in Patagonia.\nThe river's many U-shaped bends, called meanders, are carved out gradually: When flow pressure isn't equal on both banks of a river, erosion tends to warp small bends into dramatic, sweeping curves over long periods of time. But the prospect of much swifter change looms over the Santa Cruz: A controversial hydroelectric dam project already underway downstream will potentially have a drastic impact on the entire river's hydrology and ecosystem.",

It's actually a pair of waterfalls, a lower and an upper one, on the Sunwapta River. Their water comes from the Athabasca Glacier, so volumes are higher in the summer due to seasonal glacial melting. Jasper National Park is the largest national park in the Canadian Rockies, with more than 4,000 square miles for camping, hiking, water sports, and other activities. Wildlife in the park includes elk, grizzly bears, moose, bighorn sheep, and caribou.",

		"description": "In honor of World Bicycle Day, we share a bird's-eye view from Utah of two mountain bikers riding on the Shafer Trail switchbacks of White Rim Road in Canyonlands National Park. In 2018, the UN officially recognized 'the uniqueness, longevity and versatility of the Bicycle, which has been in use for two centuries, and that it is a simple, affordable, reliable, clean and environmentally fit sustainable means of transportation.'\nGerman Karl von Drais is credited with creating the first version of a bike in 1817; it was a heavy wooden contraption that the rider pushed forward with his or her feet. It had many names—the 'draisine,' 'velocipede,' and 'dandy horse'—and it was a fad for a few years, but eventually the bike was banned because it was too dangerous (no brakes!).\nThe bicycle has gone through many iterations since then, from the less-than-comfortable 'boneshaker' in the 1860s, followed by the 'penny-farthing' with its huge front wheel, to today’s popular fatbikes and e-bikes. During one of America's biking booms, in the 1970s, more bikes were sold than cars. Today bicycles remain as popular as ever, so whether it's for recreation or transportation, the bicycle is here to stay.",

A one-way bottleneck along an otherwise two-way main road, the bridge's humped shape tends to obscure oncoming cars, earning it yet another local nickname: Pont y Rhegi (Bridge of Swearing).",

		"description": "Every year between late May and mid-June, synchronous fireflies gather into a sparkling, rhythmic light show in the forests of Great Smoky Mountains National Park. As part of their two-week mating display, the female lightning bugs synchronize their flashes with nearby males so that every few seconds waves of light ripple through the woods. Of at least 19 species of fireflies that live in Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Photinus carolinus is the only species with synchronous light displays, but they can also be found in Allegheny National Forest in Pennsylvania and Congaree National Park in South Carolina. Other species of synchronous fireflies are particularly prevalent in Southeast Asia.\nNot all firefly species flash light. But of those that do, each species has a characteristic flash pattern that helps the males and females recognize each other. In most species, like this one, the males fly and flash, while the females generally stay still and respond with a flash of their own. It's not clear why some species of fireflies flash synchronously, although some hypotheses involve diet, social interaction, and altitude. No matter why they do it, the flashing of lightning bugs is a magical sight to see—and we can all use a little magic sometimes.",

The bridge and St. Paul's Cathedral, seen a few blocks north across the Thames, were built about 300 years apart (just a fraction of London's nearly 2,000-year history).

Framed against a light blue ('goluboi') sky, the church's colorful exterior is almost as dazzling as the motley mosaics covering the walls inside. The Griboyedov Canal, cutting south and west through a district dense with museums, theaters, and parks, is part of Saint Petersburg's intricate system of man-made waterways that earned the city one of its nicknames: Venice of the North.",

But why today, you ask? That's because the novel follows the meanderings and thoughts (and meandering thoughts) of the protagonist, Leopold Bloom, and a host of other characters—real and fictional—from 8 AM on June 16, 1904, through the early hours of the next morning.\nIn 1924, Joyce himself mentioned in a letter that some people celebrated 'Bloom's day' on June 16, which must have amused him. Then, for the 50th anniversary of the events in the novel, a group of Irish literary figures and other 'Ulysses' enthusiasts organized a kind of a pilgrimage on June 16, 1954, ambling along the route that Bloom takes through Dublin. Bloomsday has since grown into a worldwide literary celebration. People in Dublin can follow in the characters' footsteps through the city's streets, visiting places immortalized in the novel; others may celebrate by dressing in the fashions of the time, eating food mentioned in the book, and performing readings of the text.",

		"description": "Juneteenth, also known as Freedom Day, originated June 19, 1865 to recognize the day the remaining enslaved African Americans in the Confederacy were made aware of the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation more than two years prior. This occurred in Texas—the most remote of the Confederate states—when Union troops arrived in Galveston Bay and read federal orders declaring that all enslaved people were free. Once a mostly regional observance, Juneteenth has in recent decades become a much broader celebration of African American freedom. This year in particular, it's seen as a way to express support for the African American and Black community during a time of widespread protests against systemic racism and police brutality.\nTo celebrate Juneteenth this year, we've come to the Texas African American History Memorial on the State Capitol grounds in Austin, Texas. The memorial was created by Ed Dwight, a sculptor, former engineer, Air Force test pilot, and the first African American astronaut candidate. Dwight's sculpture, which was unveiled in 2016, depicts the broad sweep of African American history in Texas, from the 1500s to the present—centuries of enslavement, the Civil War, and legalized oppression and segregation, to current struggles and achievement. That history starts on the left side of the sculpture with Estevanico, an enslaved North African explorer who is thought to be the first person from Africa to walk on the soil of present-day Texas, in 1528.\nThe monument also depicts the events of June 19, 1865, when the last enslaved people of the United States were finally declared free. Juneteenth has been a Texas state holiday since 1980, though it's long been celebrated in the Lone Star State. Today most states have passed legislation recognizing Juneteenth as either a state holiday or day of observance and many are advocating for it to be made a federal holiday.",

Built in 1958, it replaced the original 1933 Gorch Fock, which was seized by the Soviets in the wake of World War II (but is now back home in Stralsund, Germany, as a museum ship). Because traditionally rigged tall ships are valued as tools for learning general sailing skills, the '58 Gorch Fock is still in official service—but for much of the 21st century, it's been in and out of dry dock for repairs and safety improvements.\nToday marks the International Day of the Seafarer, which serves to highlight how crucial overseas shipping is to daily life around the world. The event is also intended to remind us of the bravery and sacrifice shown by sailors of all stripes as they endeavor to perform this essential function. As much as 90% of all cargo travels by sea at some point in its journey to the store or your door, so next time you encounter an old sea dog on a dark and stormy night, be sure to say thanks.",

Madagascar's national tree is the stately baobab—impossibly tall and imposing, but a little silly at the same time. In fact, its nickname is the 'upside-down tree,' since it looks like it was planted with its roots in the air. Six of the world's nine baobab species are native to Madagascar. The trees we're looking at today are Grandidier's baobabs, the largest of them all, lining the Avenue of the Baobabs near the western coast.\nThis species can grow up to 100 feet tall and 36 feet in diameter, a measurement that can actually change as the trunks store water during rainy seasons to help the trees survive in times of drought. Baobabs are also known for their longevity; these growing along the Avenue of the Baobabs are estimated to be 2,800 years old. Locally, the Grandidier's baobab is referred to as 'renala,' or 'mother of the forest.'",

Since the Middle Ages, this spot has been a destination for religious pilgrimages. The faithful are drawn no doubt by the views and, perhaps, the dangerous path to get there—enlightenment shouldn't come easy.\nOver the centuries, the structure has evolved from a hermitage to a church, first inaugurated in 1530, and eventually to a sanctuary for contemplation and reflection. In the mid-1970s, architect Guido Tisato oversaw a major renovation, including digging out more of the mountain to add additional space. Today, visitors can reach the sanctuary from above via a paved path or from below, on a longer trail, known as the 'Path of Hope,' that ends with a steep staircase zigzagging upward. We think those who manage the climb up may be justified in feeling a little superior.",

The goats enjoy the small yellow fruit these trees produce, and when the low-hanging fruit is gone they're willing and able to make the climb. Goats aren't the only ones benefitting from these trees. The nuts from argan trees are used to produce argan oil, which is edible and also used for some rather pricey cosmetics, making it a valuable export.\nThe goats contribute to the argan oil business when orchard owners enlist them to unwittingly harvest the nuts. Because the goats tend to swallow the entire fruit, the nuts pass through their digestive systems intact. Once the nuts are excreted, they're gathered from the droppings and cracked open to expose the seed kernels inside—it's these kernels that contain the valuable oil. Occasionally the partnership between orchard owner and goat backfires, though, and the goats must be prevented from chomping away too much in the interest of profits. It's all a delicate balancing act.",

People come for the sun, the Greek and Roman ruins, the lush Valley of Butterflies, and especially Rhodes City, the largest medieval town in Europe. Its wonderfully preserved stone walls and gates, cobblestone streets, and Palace of the Grand Master of the Knights of Rhodes all contributed to its designation as a World Heritage site in 1988.",

They may not be the kind of 'dogs' you typically think of, but Cape foxes are from the same family (Canidae) as the pooches you know and love. Partly to escape the heat in the desert scrubland it prefers, the Cape fox is most active just before dawn or after dusk, commonly spotted during the early mornings and early evenings.\nIf you're wondering how the phrase 'dog days of summer' came about, look to the sky. In summertime in the Northern Hemisphere, around the time of the summer solstice, the star called Sirius makes its return to the night sky after having been absent during winter. Better known as the Dog Star, because it's part of the Canis Major constellation, Sirius is by far the brightest star in the night sky. This time of year, it becomes visible again above the eastern horizon for a moment just before sunrise.",

Herman Melville wrote in 1851 that Nantucket whalers 'owned' the world's oceans. To get home, all those whaling ships had to navigate the perilous shoals between the island's north shore and nearby Cape Cod. This lighthouse was the solution, first in the form of a wooden tower that burned in 1816, then a stone version toppled by a storm in 1984. The current structure, built partly with materials from the previous one, was dedicated in 1986 and has been in official operation since.",

The sparsely populated peninsula makes up the western edge of the Ring of Fire, a chain of volcanoes along the Pacific Ocean that account for 90% of the world's seismic activity. Wild, remote, and primal, Kamchatka is home to more than just volcanoes. Among the abundant wildlife that call the peninsula home are the arctic fox, tundra wolf, reindeer, lynx, huge Chukotka moose, and the Kamchatka brown bear that can tip the scales at 1,400 pounds.",

But today we're also listening to those who follow astrology. If you've been noticing an uptick in confusion or a spate of misfortune lately, astrologers will tell you that 'Mercury retrograde' could be the culprit. Lasting through July 12, this is one of three times each year that Mercury appears to be traveling backwards—or what's sometimes called Mercury retrograde. This happens due to an optical illusion caused by differences in Earth's orbit relative to Mercury's. Because Mercury is named after the Romans' messenger of the gods, astrology associates the planet with communication. Accordingly, during Mercury retrograde, the astrologically inclined expect misunderstandings, scheduling problems, and disagreements to abound.",

About a month after the seal pups are born, they're abruptly weaned when their mothers return to the sea to hunt for food and find a new mate.

Today, the birthday of that famous American advocate for pursuing a simple life is also National Simplicity Day, an annual reminder to unplug, slow down, step back, and consider your life. Thoreau's most famous work (that you probably haven't read since high school), 'Walden,' is his account of the two years, two months, and two days he spent away from society in a cabin near the shore of Walden Pond in Concord, Massachusetts. Through this work he encourages us to take a step back and look for ways to simplify our lives. 'Our life is frittered away by detail,' Thoreau observed. 'Simplify, simplify.'\nThis advice is as sound today as it was 165 years ago when it first appeared in print. Some things you can do to mark the day are unplug from your devices (even this one—eventually); declutter your house; take a walk in the woods; and maybe even reread 'Walden.'",

All too often dismissed as pesky, drab counterparts to our brightly fluttering friends the butterflies, moths seem to hog every light but the spotlight. But they don't need flashy marketing to win the numbers game: With an estimated 160,000 moth species (though some estimates go up to half a million), they vastly outnumber their swaggering butterfly cousins in the Lepidoptera order.\nPlus, as the nine-spotted moth in today's image proves, butterflies don't have such a wing up on pretty patterning as you might think. The moth's orange stripes and white flecks across its 1.5-inch wingspan make it one of many moths that show aposematism, biologist-ese for colorful visual features that say 'I taste bad' to predators but 'I look cool' to humans. And that's not all moths can tell us: Moths are important bioindicators, meaning a healthy moth population in most cases indicates a healthy environment. So as National Moth Week kicks off today, consider leaving the porch light on a few nights to see what kind of moth-ley crew swarms to your door.",

Legend claims that when the fort was built on this rocky coastal outpost, it took just three months to construct. The locals of what was then Ragusa knew they had limited time before their rivals, the Venetians, would arrive to build their own outpost and rule over them. According to 'The Chronicles of Ragusa,' the plan worked—the fort was completed just as the surprised Venetians arrived in ships heavy with supplies.\nAs the centuries marched on, Fort Lovrijenac was reinforced and added to until an earthquake in 1667 nearly destroyed it together with the rest of the town. What would eventually become Dubrovnik was rebuilt, as was the fort, complete with an inscription above the gate that translates to 'Freedom is not to be sold for all the treasure in the world.' Today the walled city of Dubrovnik is a UNESCO World Heritage site, safeguarding much of its Gothic, Renaissance, and Baroque architecture, including churches, monasteries, palaces, and fountains.",

In fact, for several weeks in the period around the summer solstice, the sun doesn't set at all on Disko Bay. Technically, the 'midnight sun' occurs in places north of the Arctic Circle or south of the Antarctic Circle when the sun remains visible at the local midnight. This natural phenomenon lasts from April to August in the northern regions of Greenland. (The opposite effect, polar night, occurs during winter months when the sun does not rise above the horizon.)\nSo much light during the summer months means that the massive icebergs in nearby Ilulissat Icefjord are easily visible from this west coast town, which is home to about 4,500 people, most of them Indigenous Inuit. Ilulissat is also home to almost as many Greenland dogs, which are sturdy sled dogs with thick fur that prevents frostbite. They're bred for long-distance travel in cold climates, and those physical attributes come in handy, because even in the height of summer, average daily temperatures here barely top 50 degrees, despite all that sun.",

Both activities are best attempted between July and October, though: During wetter months, the falls converge into a thundering cataract as the Gallinas rises to form torrential rapids.\nIn the ancient Huastec language, Tamul means 'place of pitchers,' comparing the cenotes—or underwater sinkholes—that dot the Gallinas riverbed to giant vessels being poured out by the gods. This corner of the state of San Luis Potosí was once a domain of the Huastecs, who split from the Maya three to four millennia ago to settle the lands from here east to the Gulf of Mexico. By the early 16th century, the society crumbled as other Mesoamerican cultures gained influence and the Spanish began colonizing Mexico. But many of their stone temples and earthen pyramids in the region still remain, as do tens of thousands of native Huastec speakers.",

Seventy-two miles in circumference, with an average depth of 1,000 feet, it has the sixth-largest volume of any lake in the US—only the Great Lakes are larger. For at least 6,000 years, the territory of the Washoe people centered around Lake Tahoe, but the arrival of non-native people in the 19th century led to a series of armed conflicts and eventual loss of land to farms and townships.\nThe lake has a long history of disputes. Even its name wasn't formally agreed upon until 1945. Since the first European American saw it in 1844, it has been called Lake Bonpland, Mountain Lake, Fremont's Lake, Fallen Leaf Lake, Maheon Lake, and Lake Bigler, after California's third governor and noted Confederate sympathizer, John Bigler. It was that name that Lake Tahoe finally supplanted on maps starting in 1862. The name 'Tahoe' is thought to derive from the Washoe word 'Da ow ga,' meaning 'The Lake.' But not everyone was enamored of the new moniker. Mark Twain famously criticized it as an 'unmusical cognomen' and that it should retain the name Bigler 'until some name less flat, insipid and spooney than Tahoe is invented for it.' Apparently, we're still waiting.",

In Arizona and New Mexico, powerful thunderstorms roll in most every afternoon from early July until mid-September. Here, in the Sonoran Desert north of Tucson, Arizona, severe weather over saguaro cactus makes for a dramatic scene.\nThe monsoon–which refers to the entire season and not just a single storm—is caused by intense daytime heat, which drives shifts in wind patterns that bring moist air to the generally arid Southwest. Mornings typically begin fair, but as temperatures rise throughout the day, precipitation gathers into clouds that finally burst in periods of heavy rain during the late afternoon and evening. The monsoon storms also bring huge dust storms called 'haboobs,' borrowing the name from similar storms in Sudan.\nIn Arizona, the monsoon can account for nearly half the state's annual rainfall, which averages little more than 7 inches. Water is precious in the desert, and the region relies on this weather pattern to fill reservoirs and maintain the fragile ecosystem. While dry lightning early in the season can spark wildfires, as the monsoon rain starts to fall, it helps reduce local fire danger.",

In honor of Oyster Day, August 5 of each year, we're getting a glimpse of just one method of oyster mariculture, or farming in open seawater. The briny bivalves may be grown on beds, rods, racks, or—in this case—ropes, but the basic process is simple: Growing surfaces are 'seeded' with whole or ground oyster shells before oyster larvae are introduced. The shells attract the larvae, which attach themselves and soon grow into a new layer of mature oysters. Humans have been doing this at least since the days of ancient Rome, but wild-picked oysters have been an important food source to many cultures since prehistory.\nOysters also played an important role in US history, and could impact the future of our biggest city: Until the 1800s, New York Harbor was home to a trillion or more oysters, possibly half the world's supply. Naturally growing on craggy, reeflike beds on the harbor floor, they formed strong barriers against swelling storms. By the 20th century, overharvesting and pollution had decimated New York's oyster population. When Hurricane Sandy hit the NYC region in 2012, it highlighted the city's vulnerability to extreme weather, especially as ocean levels continue to rise. Since then, initiatives have aimed to seed new beds with oyster shells, many collected from local restaurants.",

Through November, the cows will stay in this region while their newborn calves grow strong enough to make the trek back to the cold Antarctic waters where their main food source—the small crustacean called krill—is abundant.\nHumpbacks are found in every ocean in the world. They're known for their magical songs, which like the humpback itself, can travel great distances through the water. Scientists are still studying these sounds to find out what they mean. But it's likely the humpbacks sing to communicate with others and attract potential mates. Or maybe it's a way to pass the time on that 4,000-mile journey through the oceans.",

		"description": "Sea fireflies may glow like the fireflies that send out backyard beacons at night, but that's about where the similarities end between the two species. Scientists call the bioluminescent crustaceans washing over these rocks Vargula hilgendorfii, and here in Japan they're commonly known as umi-hotaru. They're visible at night in the shallow sea waters and beaches of Japan, although other species of the genus Vargula can be seen glowing in the waters of the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean Sea, and off the California coast.\nEach sea firefly is about the size of a sesame seed, yet as a group they set off an impressive aura. Their glow intensifies depending on the salinity of the sea water and other physical stimuli. Besides lighting up the shores at night, the crustaceans do their part cleaning up the beach by munching on sandworms and dead fish. That's just one less thing for beachcombers to worry about during a glimmering seaside walk.",

The species gained widespread popularity in 1905, when a New York Times article hailed it as 'the king of all kings in the domain of animal life,' and the 'absolute warlord of the earth.' The so-called 'tyrant lizard' has been a star ever since, regularly appearing in film, TV, literature, and—for some of us—nightmares.\nToday's date is significant in the history of tyrannosaur scholarship, because it was on August 12, 1990, that one of the largest, best-preserved, and most complete T-rex skeletons was discovered. It's known as Sue, named after paleontologist Sue Hendrickson, who discovered it in the Badlands of South Dakota while a tire of her truck was being fixed. 'Sue' was auctioned off for $8 million and is now on display at the Field Museum in Chicago, where anyone can come in for a close encounter. Rawwr!",

Beginning around 9,000 years ago and continuing into the 20th century, the caves were further carved and expanded by these human occupants into an elaborate settlement. It's now called the Sassi di Matera, a pair of districts in the city of Matera, Italy.\nOver the centuries, more modern structures were built on the land surrounding the caves, but people still lived in the cave-homes as late as the 1950s. Many have said that Matera is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. In 1993, UNESCO named the Sassi di Matera a World Heritage site, and many of the cave dwellings have since been preserved—some of the once-decrepit caves have even been converted to restaurants and boutique hotels. Enough of the old-world charm still adorns Matera that Hollywood took notice. Filmmakers have used the city as a shooting location to stand in for ancient Rome and, in 2017, Wonder Woman's home, Themyscira.",

		"description": "This expansive and iconic view, as seen from Hunts Mesa in the Navajo Nation, is none other than Monument Valley, also known as the Valley of the Rocks when translated from the Navajo language (Tsé Biiʼ Ndzisgaii). The red sandstone formations are synonymous with the American Southwest and have stunned moviegoers for nearly a century. The largest of American Indian territories, Navajo Nation covers more than 27,000 square miles and reaches into portions of Arizona, Utah, and New Mexico.\nDuring World War II, an elite team of Navajos left their homes to join the US Marine Corps and solve a communications challenge. In the Pacific, many of the US combat codes had been cracked by the Japanese army and navy, leaving US troops vulnerable to attack by Axis forces. But in 1942, the first 29 Navajo recruits helped develop a new undecipherable code. They used common words and phrases from their tribal language to convey some messages and created special codes to describe military terms; for instance, various weapons of war were assigned Navajo bird names. Code Talkers could encode, send, and decode a three-line English message text—without error—in roughly 20 to 150 seconds. It took machines of the day at least 30 minutes, sometimes longer, to do the same thing.\nSome say the US might not have prevailed in the fiercely fought Battle of Iwo Jima had it not been for the achievements of the Navajo Code Talkers. And yet, their contributions would go unknown until the program was finally declassified in 1968. Since 1982, August 14 is celebrated as Navajo Code Talkers Day to commemorate the elite team as well as other Native Americans and First Nations people who had developed codes used in WWII and other conflicts. It's a fascinating history that you can learn more about by taking our quiz.",

		"description": "In honor of Canada's National Acadian Day, we're on the shores of New Brunswick as the ocean recedes to reveal the Bay of Fundy's massive intertidal zone. The tide is a big deal at the bay—more than five times bigger than in most places. Typical tides around the world have a range of 3 to 6 feet, but these waters drop as far as 50 feet from high to low tide.\nNational Acadian Day celebrates the legacy of the Acadians, Canada's first permanent French residents. The agrarian Acadians first settled what's now Nova Scotia in 1605 and spread to nearby areas, like this one. As they established themselves over that century, the Acadians developed an identity distinct from the rest of New France. This unfortunately didn't shield them from Old World conflicts as France's longtime enemy, Britain, occupied and tried to conquer Acadia multiple times, finally succeeding in 1710. The British ultimately expelled the Acadians four decades later, a forced relocation to other British colonies where Acadians were often pressed into servitude—or to France, the mother country many Acadians never knew, and to which many wouldn't survive the voyage.\nBut that tragic chapter is far from the end of the Acadians' story. Some of them eventually returned to Acadia, and their culture still permeates Canada's Maritime Provinces—as well as another unlikely locale. Thanks to France's friendly 18th-century relations with Spain, many exiled Acadians were able to settle the then-Spanish-controlled bayous of Louisiana—where 'Acadian' eventually morphed into 'Cajun.'",

Unlike most owls, burrowing owls nest and roost underground, often in tunnels abandoned by ground squirrels or prairie dogs. It's one of many traits that make the pint-sized species unique among owls. Burrowing owls live in grasslands, deserts, or other open dry areas with low vegetation. When threatened, they retreat to their burrows and are known to frighten off predators by mimicking the rattling and hissing sounds of a rattlesnake. And while most other owls sleep during the daytime, burrowing owls are often active in the daylight hours. It's as if they didn't finish proper owl training.",

With 504 Buddha statues and 2,672 sculpted relief panels, Borobudur is the world's largest Buddhist temple. It was likely constructed in the 9th century and abandoned in the 14th as much of the Indonesian population converted from Buddhism and Hinduism to Islam.\nOver time it became engulfed by the jungle, and only locals knew of its existence. When word of the temple spread in the early 1800s, a Dutch engineer and 200 workers cut down trees, burned vegetation, and dug away the earth to reveal the monument. Borobudur was eventually restored and given preservation status under UNESCO guidelines.\nOn August 17, this nation of islands at the crossroads of the Indian and Pacific Oceans will be celebrating its independence day. The Indonesian archipelago had been under Dutch control for centuries when, amid geopolitical changes following the end of World War II, Indonesian nationalist leaders proclaimed independence on August 17, 1945. After a bitter four-year struggle, the Netherlands formally recognized Indonesia as an independent nation in December 1949.",

		"description": "Today marks 100 years since women won the constitutional right to vote in the United States, and we're in Nashville, Tennessee, to celebrate five monumental figures in the women's suffrage movement. Why Nashville? Because it was Tennessee's capital that became the final battlefront in the long fight for the Nineteenth Amendment. On August 18, 1920, the state legislature faced a choice: Should Tennessee become the 36th and deciding state to ratify the amendment, securing its place in the Constitution? The stakes were high as eight states had already rejected the measure—but thanks to some unexpected 'aye' votes from known opposers (one representative switched his vote at the urging of his mother), ratification won out.\nAs for the five suffrage leaders honored by the monument in today's photo, each was present in Nashville for the ratification vote: National organizer Carrie Chapman Catt traveled to Nashville and mobilized demonstrators for the cause. Sue Shelton White, Anne Dallas Dudley, and Abby Crawford Milton each headed women's rights organizations in various parts of Tennessee and helped bring their groups' voices together for the final victory.\nBut the landmark achievement of August 18, while indisputably a women's history milestone, wasn't a complete success. That brings us to the fifth figure: local educator Juno Frankie Pierce, a key activist in the Black women's suffrage movement—a national force that wouldn't see its goals achieved for decades to come. In Tennessee and the rest of the South, African Americans' voting rights were long denied under Jim Crow laws—as were those of Native American and other minority voters in many parts of the country. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 put protections in place for previously suppressed voters, finally guaranteeing votes for marginalized groups, but voter suppression remains a concern even today in the US and around the world.",

On August 19, 1839, the French government purchased the patent for the recently invented daguerreotype photographic process, named after French inventor Louis Daguerre, and offered the invention and instructions as a gift 'Free to the World.' We'll say thanks by snapping a few shutters.\nSkip the selfies and food portraits and get creative for World Photography Day. Look for the unusual shot, keep an eye out for penguins, and who knows?

Each lobsterman or woman has a unique color and pattern to their buoys, and designs are frequently passed down through generations. When not being put to use, lobster buoys are often hung from the sides of barns and sheds—they're an iconic sight in coastal Maine.\nThe state of Maine is known as 'Vacationland' for a reason—it has a year-round population of just 1.3 million people, but it welcomes more than 10 million visitors in a typical summer. And for most, a visit to Maine isn't complete without a taste of broiled lobster tails, lobster bisque, or lobster rolls. The sweet lobster meat (dipped in butter, of course) wasn't always so revered. Lobsters were once considered trash fish; they were so abundant they could be gathered by hand on beaches, were fed to prisoners, and were used as fish bait and fertilizer. Americans' feelings toward lobster changed in the mid-1800s, mostly because newly laid railroad tracks enabled businesses to ship live Maine lobsters (packed in ice) to cities around the country. Soon discriminating diners in New York and Boston put the lowly lobster on a culinary pedestal.",

The rocks here at Death Valley's Racetrack Playa are known as 'sailing stones' and they can vary in size from a few ounces to hundreds of pounds. As seen in our image, the stones leave long trails behind them as they move across the scenic dry lakebed.\nAccounts of the stone trails emerged in the early 1900s, but no one knew just how the stones managed to have apparently 'sailed' across Racetrack Playa without someone to push them along. Because they'd never been seen moving, the sailing stones gave rise to many wild theories to explain their mobility. Then, in 2014, scientists captured the movement of the stones for the first time using time-lapse photography, and the mystery was finally solved: The stones move only with the perfect balance of melting ice, water, and wind. One day that winter of 2014, rain had formed a shallow pond that froze overnight. When it thawed in the next day's sun, the very thin ice sheet melted and cracked into floating panels. Driven by a light wind, these sheets accumulated behind the stones, and very slowly pushed them forward.",

While the 'château' never gained fame defending the ancient port (since it was never attacked), it did become notorious as a prison. Surrounded by treacherous currents—like Alcatraz in San Francisco—starting in the late 16th century it was a dumping ground for political and religious prisoners. As far as official records go, none of the prisoners condemned there ever escaped.\nHowever, there is the famous tale of an escape from the château by one Edmond Dantès. He's the titular hero of the Alexandre Dumas novel, 'The Count of Monte Cristo,' which was published in serialized fashion beginning on August 28, 1844. Though Dantès is a fictional character, the modern Château d'If maintains a prison cell named after him as a tourist attraction.

The Col d'Aubisque is one of the legendary climbs of the Tour de France, which starts today in Nice. The grueling bicycle race lasts 23 days (21 days of racing), with riders clocking around 2,200 miles overall, and this mountain pass is often one of its most challenging stages. The road up the pass has grades in either direction that can tilt past 10%. This epic mountain stage was first added to the 1910 race and it's since appeared in more than half the annual Tours, though not this year as it happens.\nJust off to the side of the road at the pass, these three giant bicycle sculptures are painted in colors that correspond to the colorful jerseys worn by Tour de France riders. The yellow bike represents the overall time leader's yellow jersey; a green jersey is worn by the leader in stage points; and a polka-dot jersey is for the best climber, or the 'King of the Mountains.' It's an apt name for anyone who conquers the Col d'Aubisque, which is an 'hors catégorie' climb, meaning it is beyond categorization. In other words, it's really, really, hard. While climbing the Aubisque in 1910, French rider Octave Lapize famously yelled at Tour officials, 'You are murderers!' Today, motorists can drive over the pass without breaking a sweat, but cyclists still have their work cut out for them.",

But if you could—hay presto—snap your fingers and teleport to any hayfield at sunset, you'd surely see similar neat rows of dry, amber-tinted grass.\nThe art of drying nutritious grasses as animal fodder is nearly as old and widespread as Jutland's gently rolling hills. And producing hay is a delicate art as well, especially in places with four distinct seasons: Those precious few fall days when the sun is bright, the air is low in moisture, and the grass is mature might make for a farmer's only chance all year to harvest, dry, and bale up the nutrient-rich vegetation. So the pithy proverb, 'Make hay while the sun shines,' is the golden rule to those who tend these golden fields.",

National Mushroom Month is celebrated each year in the month of September in the United States. That’s when the Mushroom Council, a group of commercial mushroom producers, takes advantage of the opportunity to educate people on all that fabulous fungi have to offer—especially the nutritional benefits. Mushrooms have long been associated with good health. In fact, early Romans referred to mushrooms as 'food of the gods' and hieroglyphics suggest that ancient Egyptians linked the mushroom to immortality. In modern times, we've learned that mushrooms are a powerful source of vitamins and antioxidants. Which type of mushroom is your favorite?",

Jin Mao Tower (right, 1,380 feet) was China's tallest building from 1999 until the Shanghai World Financial Center (left, 1,614 feet) opened in 2007 and took the title. Shanghai Tower (center, 2,139 feet) topped out in 2013, besting the SWFC and becoming the second-tallest skyscraper in the world (behind Dubai's Burj Khalifa, 2,722 feet).\nThe Shanghai Tower is considered a megatall building. Yes, that's self-evident, but 'megatall' is a technical term, meaning that it's over 600 meters, or 1,969 feet. The structure has struggled to enlist tenants since its 2016 opening—owing partly to its clever inline-twist design that protects it from strong winds but makes for irregular floor plans. About 50 of 128 floors were unrented as of 2019, a slow start that may have influenced China's April 2020 decree limiting skyscraper height to 500 meters (1,640 feet) and encouraging lower-rise designs with more traditional Chinese aesthetics. Regardless, Shanghai Tower's observation deck, at more than 1,800 feet above street level, has become one of the freshest attractions in the ancient city.",

Pico is one of nine islands comprising an autonomous region of Portugal called the Azores archipelago. The islands themselves are the peaks of vast volcanic mountains that rise high above the North Atlantic Ocean.\nLooming in the background of today's photo is Mount Pico, a stratovolcano partly responsible for the island's flourishing wine industry. The mineral-rich volcanic earth and warm temperate climate call for unique methods for growing grapes. Fields of vines run along the ground, resting on top of black basalt rocks the locals call 'biscoitos' (biscuits). These rock biscuits serve a purpose: During the day, the rocks absorb and give back heat, which in turn helps ripen the grapes. The bull, while picturesque, is merely a bystander enjoying the flowers and the view, and perhaps musing about mysteries of viticulture on a far-flung volcanic island.",

The WWII Siege of Malta ended in 1942, after nearly two and a half years of devastating air attacks. King George VI of the United Kingdom, which then ruled the island, awarded Malta the George Cross 'for the heroism and devotion of its people' during the great siege. The George Cross was incorporated into the flag of Malta in 1943 and remains there today.\nThe Maltese people typically celebrate Victory Day with cultural activities like literary readings, music and theatrical performances, and a regatta in the Grand Harbour, seen here. The armed forces parade on Republic Street in Valletta, ending at St. John's Co-Cathedral, where they salute the prime minister and the Maltese anthem is performed.

This time of year, the hummingbirds leave the northern latitudes of the eastern US and Canada, migrating to the warmer climes of Mexico and Central America. Along their route, many will cross the Gulf of Mexico in a single 500-mile flight, which can take 18-22 hours of nonstop flying at speeds of up to 35 miles per hour. Tiny but fierce, the ruby-throated hummingbird weighs less than a nickel. It beats its wings about 53 times a second on average, but during courtship the wingbeat rate increases to 200 times per second, the fastest of any bird.\nRuby-throated hummingbirds can eat twice their weight each day in sugar from flower nectar and feeders, with the occasional insect making up the rest of their diet. In the weeks before the migration, hummingbirds begin to eat more than usual to put on weight. The migration isn't triggered by the amount of food available, but by the length of daylight. The male hummingbirds start migrating first, and a few days or weeks later, the females and young follow. If you live along the migration route, you can help hummingbirds prepare for the journey by growing nectar flowers or putting out a hummingbird feeder—and you just might be paid a visit by these tiny fliers along their journey.",

The work was rendered on 6 acres using gravel, sand, and soil.\nWe're showcasing this artwork by a Cuban American artist today to mark the start of National Hispanic Heritage Month, a celebration of, in the US government's own words: 'The histories, cultures and contributions of American citizens whose ancestors came from Spain, Mexico, the Caribbean and Central and South America.'

The conflict started with the 'Cry of Dolores,' an event on September 16, 1810, when priest Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla rang the church bell in the nearby town of Dolores and called for a revolt to free Mexico from Spanish control. His call to arms triggered the formation of an insurgency that marched onward to San Miguel and then to the city of Guanajuato (shown in this image). The ensuing conflict spanned more than a decade, culminating with Mexico finally breaking free from Spanish rule in 1821.\nSince then, the 'Cry of Dolores' has come to symbolize the very idea of Mexican independence. Each year on the eve of Independence Day, the president of Mexico re-enacts the call to arms from the balcony of the National Palace in Mexico City, while ringing the same bell that Hidalgo used that day in 1810.",

Ordinarily, many people become naturalized citizens in group ceremonies on this day; on average, about 700,000 people become American citizens each year.\nSo why is today both Constitution Day and Citizenship Day? The reason is rooted in the World War II era. In 1940, Congress created I Am an American Day, a demonstration of patriotism. Twelve years later, President Harry Truman signed into law Citizenship Day, which replaced I Am an American Day and moved the observance to September 17, the day the Constitution was signed in 1787. Eventually, in 2004 the day was designated as the mash-up of observances we have today.",

Nearly 120 authors, including Colson Whitehead, John Grisham, Ann Patchett, Walter Mosley, and Tomi Adeyemi, will appear on virtual stages to discuss the written word from September 25-27.\nWhen the festival launched in 2001, authors and participants gathered on the grounds and in the buildings of the Library of Congress on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC. Over the years, as the National Book Festival grew to become one of the most notable US literary events, the festivities expanded to the lawn of the Capitol, then to the National Mall, and in recent years to the Washington Convention Center.\nWith the festivities occurring virtually this year, we're turning our gaze back to the stately interior of the main building of the Library of Congress, the Thomas Jefferson Building. In this image, we're looking up to the ceiling and cove of its Great Hall. Surrounding the six skylights is decorative aluminum leaf, which was more precious than silver during the 1890s when the building was constructed. When the building opened its doors to the public in 1897 it was said to be the largest library in the world and it remains so today. Its vast holdings are stored in many buildings, including the Thomas Jefferson Building, which was named for the third US president. It was Jefferson's personal 6,000-plus book collection that helped rebuild the Library of Congress' collection after British troops set fire to the original library during the War of 1812.",

Our photo for National Public Lands Day highlights the relatively unsung beauty of the more than 10,000 state parks dotting the nation from coast to coast.\nWatkins Glen State Park, just south of Seneca Lake in upstate New York, is centered around a trail that descends with this rushing stream through picturesque cliffs, passing over and under 19 waterfalls. Sure, it's not Niagara Falls (which is part of the same New York State Parks system and is the oldest state park in the US). But especially in the crisp northeastern autumn, this stepped gorge is a tranquil showcase of the rugged landscape surrounding the glacially carved Finger Lakes region.\nAccording to the National Park Service, National Public Lands Day is the largest volunteer event in the US, with opportunities to help with conservation and maintenance from city parks to national forests. But if you'd rather keep your distance, relax, and enjoy the public spaces we all share, most state and national parks are waiving their entrance fees for the day. Happy trails!",

		"description": "Today we're recognizing World Rivers Day—a conservation event that branched off in 2005 from its source, BC Rivers Day, founded near this British Columbia river's banks 40 years ago today. The Fraser River flows through a showcase of this Canadian province's diverse landscape: It originates in the Rocky Mountains, carves steep valleys through central BC, and irrigates rich farmlands outside Vancouver before spilling into the sea just south of the city. The river flows gently in this stretch, as seen from the span of the Port Mann Bridge east of Vancouver, with the Golden Ears mountains in the background. Thanks to preservation efforts, the Fraser's main stem remains completely undammed, with its drainage basin covering 25% of BC's land area.\nA drainage basin is what we in the US usually call a watershed: Every river has tributaries, or other rivers and springs that flow into it and add to its volume. A river's watershed is the area covered by the main flow and all its tributaries put together. Watersheds may exist within other watersheds, such as when a tributary is longer than the river it feeds—a classic example is North America's longest river, the Missouri, whose vast watershed is a subdivision of the sea-bound yet shorter Mississippi's.\nDelicate environments like rivers are interconnected, and actions have downstream effects—that's what World Rivers Day aims to highlight through hands-on cleanup opportunities and virtual events.",

Listed as 'near threatened,' blue sharks are found off the coast of every continent except for Antarctica, making them the most widely distributed of all sharks. Swift and powerful swimmers, blue sharks migrate long distances. It's common for them to swim 1,200 to 1,700 miles or even farther, following the clockwise currents of the Gulf Stream in search of food, mates, and 'just right' water temperatures.",

		"description": "For World Teachers' Day, we're taking you to a class of emperor penguin chicks getting a lesson from a couple of wise adults—at least that's how it looks to us. All kidding aside, the celebration has a special significance this year. Educators dedicate their lives to engaging the minds of young and old alike, all the while sparking curiosity about the world around us. But with in-person classes widely curtailed due to the coronavirus pandemic, many teachers have had to adapt their instruction methods by shifting to remote learning. More than ever we're grateful for their efforts, including their support to parents who are contributing at home.\nSpeaking of remote learning, the penguins in this photo live and learn in Antarctica at their breeding colony on Snow Hill Island. One thing we've learned on this World Teachers' Day: A group of penguin chicks is called a rookery, but when mature, they become a waddle of adult penguins, a term that also describes their graceless walking gait. About that gait: Penguins rock side to side to raise their center of gravity and compensate for their wide feet and squat legs. You might think they expend a lot of energy getting around, but the percentage of energy retained per penguin stride—or recovery rate—is 80%. In comparison, the recovery rate for humans is a mere 65% (the two penguin chicks snoozing in today's photo probably already know that).",

Built by the conquering Normans in the wake of their 1066 invasion of Britain, it was fortified as a perfect stone circle a hundred years later. Soon it was renovated into a luxurious palace with rudimentary plumbing and coveted hunting grounds. But after centuries of off-and-on use, it fell into disrepair after the English Civil War ended in 1651. It was acquired by the British government in the early 20th century. Open to the public, Restormel is now managed by the English Heritage charity trust.",

		"description": "Today is World Migratory Bird Day in Latin and South America, so to honor the occasion we've chosen these flamingos, rising above the Caribbean Sea off the coast of Venezuela. Changes in daylight hours and food availability can trigger seasonal migrations in many bird species, including flamingos. American flamingos like these will migrate relatively short distances, usually to ensure a steady food supply. Found mainly throughout the Caribbean, their range extends as far north as southern Florida.\nThe nonprofit sponsor of World Migratory Bird Day, Environment for the Americas, focuses its efforts on conserving habitats for the hundreds of bird species that migrate along north-south routes in the Americas. Most of these migratory birds use established flight paths called flyways to travel between their breeding grounds and overwintering areas. These aerial highways tend to avoid obstacles such as mountain ranges and oceans, running parallel to topographical barriers and following routes along coasts or major river valleys. Birds migrating through North America follow four main flyways, the Atlantic, Mississippi, Central, and Pacific. Because the birds need adequate food and shelter at stopover points along the way, conservation of habitats through these corridors is especially important to the birds' survival. This year, with wildfires raging across the American West, the Pacific Flyway has been especially perilous for many migratory birds.\nWhile October 10 is World Migratory Bird Day in Mexico and Central and South America, bird lovers in the US and Canada observe this conservation event on the second day in May. But wherever you live, every day is a good day to pick up some binoculars and watch the birdlife outside your own window.",

But what really makes Geghard unique are the monastic cells and chapels hewn directly into the mountain itself, with elaborate bas-relief ornamentations and multiple exquisite examples of Armenian stone crosses, or 'khachkars,' throughout.

		"description": "With this image of totem poles, carved and erected by Haida people in British Columbia, Canada, we're touching on two important events in North America today, one in the United States and the other in Canada. In the US, an increasing number of Americans observe the second Monday in October as Indigenous Peoples Day, a celebration of Native American peoples and an implicit (and sometimes explicit) critique of the Columbus Day holiday. Observations of Indigenous Peoples Day reflect an effort to honor the tribes, nations, and cultures that existed in North America before the arrival of European settlers and have endured since then.\nMeanwhile, in Canada, it's Thanksgiving Day. (Yes, they celebrate it too, just on a different date.) Like the US version, the holiday embraces a harvest-oriented theme. But most Canadians eat their big meal on Sunday. Just as we have Black Friday to recover from a day of overindulgence, Canadians gorge the day before the official Thanksgiving holiday so that everyone is rested and digested before returning to work on Tuesday.\nThe Haida and other Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast traditionally had their own feasts that were complex gift-giving ceremonies called potlatches. During a potlatch, a community leader would give away or destroy valuable items to demonstrate wealth, but also to forge and affirm family, clan, or intertribal relations. The carvings on Haida totem poles, like these, are often representations of family or clan histories that weave their society together. Haida families traditionally celebrated their histories and marked their identities by erecting totems outside their homes.",

Starfish like this one have the rare ability to wrench open a mussel just wide enough to insert a stomach-like organ that digests the bivalve's body right inside the shell.

It was here on this day in 1867 that officials of the Russian Empire formally transferred the Territory of Alaska to the United States in a sale for $7.2 million, or just around 2 cents per acre. It seems an astonishingly small price today, but at the time, opponents called it 'Seward's Folly' after then-Secretary of State William H. Seward, who negotiated the deal. Few Americans moved to the 'Last Frontier' at first, but in the 1890s, when gold was discovered in the Yukon and Alaska, a rush of prospectors and others began a wave of settlers in the territory. Ever since, Alaska, with its vast natural resources and staggering beauty, has been a prized American domain and an enduring symbol of American wilderness.",

Though scientists still don't quite understand how the individual starlings in a murmuration coordinate their tight, fluid formations, the behavior is thought to be a way to confuse predators.\nImagine if you're a falcon on the hunt and you see a small group of starlings—an easy meal if you catch one. But if the starlings spot the predator first, they may form a murmuration, swooping and diving as one, making it difficult for the falcon to isolate and hunt an individual bird.",

Rumor has it this mound is where the teenage King Edward the Martyr was assassinated, likely by his half-brother and successor Æthelred the Unready, in 978—a century before the original stone structure was built. The castle became a favorite of 13th-century ruler King John—whose luxurious renovations hid a feared dungeon where the calculating monarch starved numerous prisoners. In the mid-1600s English Civil War, noblewoman Mary Bankes—wife of the castle's new lord, who was off fighting in the war—doggedly defended it against antiroyalist forces in a three-year siege. But Mary was given up by members of her entourage and captured, and the castle was toppled into the craggy heap you see now—another betrayal to end its story.\nNowadays the remains of Corfe Castle are preserved as a Scheduled Ancient Monument by the UK—but that status might not be all that's protecting the site. Reports of children's sobs echoing through the air, unexplained flickering lights, and—most notoriously—the headless apparition of a white-clad woman have some believing specters of a millennium past still haunt the ruin.",

Considered the largest of all living owls—about the size of a fire hydrant with a 6-foot wingspan—it's among the rarest of owls, too. Experts estimate only a few thousand of these elusive birds remain, scattered in pockets of dense old-growth forests in northern Japan, the Russian Far East, northeastern China, and potentially North Korea.\nAlthough it'll eat rodents, rabbits, and other small mammals, the Blakiston's fish owl feeds mainly on aquatic life, particularly fish, and seeks out waterways that don't freeze during the bitterly cold winters of its range. Rather than swoop in silently on its prey like most owls, this fish owl often takes a more earth-bound approach, walking along the forest floor to find a good fishing spot, then perching on the bank, and waiting—just like any good angler would. When it sees a fish, it pounces, grabbing the prey with its talons and popping back out of the water to eat.\nFor more mysterious sightings, be sure to check out our Halloween homepage tomorrow.",

This time of year, polar bears are waiting for the sea ice to form so they can venture out onto the Labrador Sea to hunt for seals.\nAs sea ice coverage continues to shrink due to warming oceans, the polar bear population faces a rapidly shrinking habitat. Polar bears have large hunting ranges and rely on the ice to get around. Their role as alpha predators in the Arctic is a crucial part of the natural balance in their unique ecosystem.

The name of the portage derives from an Inupiaq (Inuit) word meaning 'wild onions' for the many wild alliums that grow here. But the native Inuit people don't come just to forage for onions.

The refuge protects critical habitat for the hundreds of manatees that migrate here each winter.\nMost West Indian manatees off the coast of Florida live in shallow and marshy areas where they feed on sea grass, mangrove leaves, and algae.

Since 2012, National Bison Day has been observed on the first Saturday of November to acknowledge the animal's cultural, historical, and economic significance—as well as its remarkable comeback. Bison were once plentiful in North America. Tens of millions strong until the mid-1800s, they roamed in great herds, helping to diversify and maintain the prairie habitat. They've also played several important roles in Native American cultures. Indigenous peoples have used every part of the bison for food, utensils, and clothing—and they pay tribute to the giant beasts in religious rituals.\nSettlement of the American West caused habitat loss for the bison and that, combined with overhunting, had nearly wiped out the species altogether by 1900. In an effort to save the bison, the American Bison Society formed in 1905 at New York City’s Bronx Zoo—President Theodore Roosevelt was named the organization’s honorary president. The group’s goal was to create wild bison reserves in the American West, but they used the Bronx Zoo to propagate a seed stock of animals to revive the population. Beginning in 1907, the zoo shipped small herds of bison to the first three of the wildlife refuges: the Wichita National Forest and Game Preserve in Oklahoma, Wind Cave National Park in South Dakota, and the National Bison Range in Montana. Fast-forward to today, and more than 20,000 bison roam on public lands in the United States.",

The main building, Derwent Island House, is set out of view farther back on the woody isle.

It's enjoyed government protection since 1939, first as a national monument and more completely after it was upgraded to national park status on this day in 1978. The park protects 244,000 acres of dramatically eroded bedrock replete with fossil beds—as well as the nation's largest mixed-grass prairie, hosting bison, prairie dogs, and endangered black-footed ferrets.\nBefore it was a national park, Native Americans called the Badlands home for more than 10,000 years. The Lakota had displaced other tribes to control the region by about 150 years ago—the same time settlers from the East were undermining Native power structures throughout the frontier. In response to these incursions, many Lakota in the late 19th century embraced a cross-tribal spiritual movement known as the 'Ghost Dance.' It was a system of rituals—including the namesake circle dance often performed here in the Badlands—believed to impede the encroachment of white settlers and deliver Natives from violence. But those efforts seemed futile by late 1890 as, just south of here, conflicts culminated in the Wounded Knee massacre where US forces killed more than 250 unarmed Lakota men, women, and children.\nThe conflict and ensuing tragedy is one of American history's ugliest chapters—but it bears reflection during Native American History Month as we ponder the Badlands' past, as vast and multilayered as the bedrock here.",

		"description": "Today is Veterans Day, the day we set aside to honor those who have served in the United States Armed Forces. There are roughly 18 million living veterans in the US, including nearly 2.25 million who served during the Korean War. June 25 of this year marked the 70th anniversary of the start of the Korean War, when North Korean troops invaded South Korea. While 21 nations contributed forces to the United Nations' defense of South Korea, 90% of the troops who served in the Korean theater were from the United States.\nThe Korean War Veterans Memorial, shown here, was dedicated on July 27, 1995 in Washington, and consists of four parts: the mural wall, the pool of remembrance, the United Nations wall, and the statues. The 19 stainless steel statues were sculpted by Frank Gaylord of Barre, Vermont. They're approximately 7 feet tall and represent the various ethnicities of the recently integrated American forces who served in Korea. They also reflect a cross section of the US service divisions that fought in the war—they depict an advance party of 14 Army, three Marine, one Navy, and one Air Force personnel. The statues stand in patches of juniper bushes and are separated by polished granite strips, which give a semblance of order and symbolize the rice paddies of Korea.\nWhile veterans account for only about 7% of the US population, they performed an outsized service to our country, and their commitment to the Constitution and the nation was total. Today would be a great day to find one and offer your thanks.",

		"description": "To the superstitiously inclined, this flock of ravens—pictured battling a snowstorm in Finland—is nothing short of a bad omen, while to others it's just a bunch of beaks. Likewise, today is just another flip of the calendar to some, while Friday the 13th consigns others to a day of dread—or at least one of relative inactivity to avoid potential mishaps.\nThe notion of Friday the 13th as doubly jinxed is only a century or two old, but Friday and the number 13 have each long been pegged as unlucky. Old Norse and Christian traditions both tell of suppers spoiled by a malign 13th guest (Loki the trickster and Judas the betrayer, respectively), while nautical lore says a voyage that dares begin on a Friday is doomed to sink to the watery depths. The popular mind began combining the number with the weekday to posit the mother of all bad days in the 1800s, but some historians say it was with the popular 1907 novel 'Friday the 13th'—where a conniving stockbroker incites a Wall Street crash on the titular date—that the compounded phobias became an enduring meme.\nIn any case, whether you call this bad luck stuff bona fide or baloney, consider trying your luck at today's quiz.

Celebrations might be a bit different this year, but buildings will still be brightened by these decorative drawings, twinkling lights, and small oil lamps, known as diyas.\nDiwali, which means 'row of lights' in the ancient language of Sanskrit, is commemorated every fall by millions of Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, and some Buddhists in India and across the world. Each religion marks different historical events and stories, but what they all have in common is the concept of new beginnings, the triumph of good over evil, and the victory of light over darkness.

This image shows the burst of color along the shores of Lake Tekapo, famed for its annual lupin blooms. The colorful carpets of purples, pinks, blues, and whites along waterways and roads look stunning, drawing tourists to the area, and locals appreciate the economic benefits that come with these visitors. But lupins hail from North America, and in New Zealand, they're considered invasive species that crowd out native flora, ruining the habitat for birds like the wrybill, banded dotterel, and other species that live along the waterside.\nBeloved by some, rued by others, lupins are said to have taken hold here thanks to local resident Connie Scott. As the story goes, back in the 1950s, Scott scattered lupin seeds along a main highway to add some color to the barren landscape and the blooms have been spreading ever since. Scott's remembered these days as the 'Lupin Lady.' A beautiful legacy? Suppose it depends on your point of view.",

A couple centuries after the Abu Simbel temples were completed, Ramesses' empire had collapsed and the sands of the Nubian region of North Africa began to consume them. European explorers 'discovered' Abu Simbel in the early 1800s, leading to massive efforts to excavate and preserve the ruins of the great pharaoh's monument to himself.\nBut it wasn't until the 1950s, when the Egyptian government began drawing up plans for the Aswan High Dam, that preservation of Abu Simbel and other historic sites took on extra urgency. Planners knew the dam would flood the banks of the Nile, submerging the temples. So, the United Nations' UNESCO branch set to work on a solution to keep Abu Simbel preserved and accessible. In 1968, UNESCO's first major project was to literally move the massive temples to higher ground. They succeeded, of course, safeguarding one of the world's great archaeological sites. Out of this effort emerged UNESCO's drive to protect the world's most important sites of both cultural and natural heritage. To date, UNESCO has protected more than 1,000 World Heritage Sites across 167 countries that are ‘irreplaceable sources of life and inspiration.'",

This one seems perfectly formfitting.\nThe female will lay two to four eggs and then both sexes will take turns incubating them until the chicks hatch two weeks later. And no, the newborn chicks don't have those ginormous bills—they're born blind and naked, with short bills—something that must please their parents while they share this small space.

This is just one of the many spectacular peaks of the Mont Blanc massif, the storied Alps range in eastern France that stretches across the border into Italy and Switzerland. It was here in France's Chamonix valley that mountaineering became a sport in the mid-1700s. This dramatic peak was first summited in 1818, a feat that helped to popularize mountain climbing throughout Europe.\nSkilled mountaineers still climb the Aiguille du Midi, but these days the rest of us can choose to reach the top the easy way. A cable car to the summit went into service in 1955 and is still considered the highest vertical-ascent cable car in the world. Visitors can climb aboard in the valley town of Chamonix and ride to the top of the Aiguille du Midi—more than 9,000 vertical feet—in under 20 minutes. The cable cars and viewing platform were upgraded in recent years, and a new feature called 'Step into the Void' was added in 2013. It allows courageous tourists to stand in a glass room jutting out from the mountain and look down through the glass floor with more than 3,000 feet of free air under their feet.",

As Bern grew over the centuries, it erected defensive walls and moats only to tear them down again with each successive wave of expansion. In their place are now broad public spaces for outdoor cafes and markets, like the Zibelemärit (Onion Market), an annual fall tradition.\nSince at least the 1850s—and possibly much longer ago—the people of Bern have awakened very early on the fourth Monday of November to greet farmers who come to the city offering huge, beautiful garlands of onions and garlic for sale. This year, the coronavirus pandemic has put a stop to the public festival, but we're quite sure that on the streets of Bern's Old Town, the aroma of onion tarts and Glühwein is wafting out onto the streets from these perfectly preserved medieval houses.",

Olmsted designed the pedestrian walkway to be the only straight path in all the park. Lining the path on either side is a majestic canopy made from hundreds of American elms. Chances are, you've seen an Elm Street in an American town or two. These stately trees with gracefully spreading branches once populated many parts of the country, but were devastated by Dutch elm disease beginning in the 1930s. The trees here flanking the Mall make up one of the oldest living stands of American elms in North America. They stand today, not only alive but thriving, thanks to dedicated Central Park arborists who monitor and protect them.

		"description": "Nestled at the foot of Mount Tampa in the Southern Carpathian Mountains of Romania, Brașov is a wonderful example of medieval Europe's intersecting cultures. Founded by Teutonic Knights, settled by Saxons and Hungarians, and influenced by the Ottoman Empire, the Tartars, and the native Romanians, the city's Gothic architecture and unique cuisine reflect its rich history. The city's Christmas market is held throughout the month of December and is dominated by a 90-foot-tall, live Christmas tree. The market's numerous stalls feature food, drink, and local crafts.\nThe festival is known as 'Braşov—the city from the tales,' perhaps because legend has it that this square is where the children of Hamelin emerged after being led away by the Pied Piper. However you arrive, it's a magical place to drink a cup of cheer and toast to your Romanian hosts with a hearty 'Noroc!' But even if you're keeping it local this year, it's easy to be warmed even by the image of this golden glow from 'the city from the tales.'",

Established in 1931 to protect a small herd of just 11 African elephants, today Addo ranks as third largest of the 19 national parks in South Africa. It provides a safe haven for about 600 of these magnificent creatures, as well as Cape buffaloes, various antelope species, lions, hyenas, and endangered black rhinos.\nThe organizers of World Wildlife Conservation Day aim to raise awareness about the need to protect wildlife from illegal trafficking in animal parts and products. Because animal trafficking is the most immediate threat to wild elephants, tigers, and rhinos, they encourage people to pledge to avoid products derived from wildlife. Consider the African elephant. Both species—the African savanna elephant (like these) and the smaller African forest elephant—have long been targets of poachers for their ivory tusks. Although millions of elephants once roamed Africa, today only an estimated 400,000 remain.",

These fortifications made clear that Rocca Calascio was ready for any military rivals who might scale the slopes from the valley below to attack this garrison. The fight never came. The ruins you see here are not battle scars but the result of a powerful earthquake. By the early 1700s, Rocca Calascio was abandoned, but it can still claim the title of highest fortress in the Apennines—and some of the most spectacular views in all of Italy.

		"description": "Are we looking at some sort of steampunk time machine? Not quite, but these clock-like rotors did help alter the course of history. The action took place during World War II at England's Bletchley Park, a country estate that served as a top-secret facility. An assembled team, including the pioneering computer scientist Alan Turing, developed this device, known as a Bombe machine. It was instrumental in cracking the Germans' 'uncrackable' Enigma code, which was used for encrypting secret messages in German war operations. The Enigma code was itself generated by a rotor-driven machine that re-scrambled the code each day—so the Bombe mirrored those mechanics to keep up with the changing encryption. Insights the Bombe and other programmable machines provided into enemy military plans helped to speed the Allies' eventual triumph—some even argue that the codebreakers' efforts won the war.\nNow it's the future, and Bletchley Park hosts the UK's National Museum of Computing. And thanks to forward-thinking educational efforts, computer science is no longer such an enigma. Computer Science Education Week, taking place this year December 7-13, is an annual event aimed at inspiring students to pursue CS. It's organized by Code.org, a resource for short coding tutorials themed around 'Star Wars,' 'Frozen,' and more. During CSEdWeek, people of all ages are invited to try Code.org's Hour of Code, a range of fun yet intensive 60-minute coding sessions offered through its website.",

This extraordinary plant has adapted to grow only in the adverse conditions found on the high slopes of the Bolivian and Peruvian Andes. To see several of them in bloom at once is truly special, for the queen of the Andes sends up her flowering stalk just once, after a century or so of painstaking growth. A single plant will bloom for about three months, producing anywhere from 8,000 to 20,000 flowers, then die.\nBecause mountains present a variety of altitudes, exposures, and gradients, they host a broad spectrum of climatic zones and ecosystems. The plants in our image are thriving in Peru's Cordillera Blanca (White Range), the highest and most glaciated tropical mountain range in the world. Several peaks in the Cordillera Blanca tower more than 20,000 feet in elevation, making it a world-class climbing destination. Each step up or down in altitude seems to introduce a new ecosystem, with plants and animals that have adapted to each differentiated zone.\nProtecting this biodiversity found on mountains is the theme for 2020's International Mountain Day, held each year on December 11. The UN, which founded International Mountain Day, invites us to join the conversation about the importance of mountains. On social media, use the hashtag #MountainsMatter to share about the biodiversity in the mountains near you.",

Although many people assume the red, white, pink, purple, or marbled colors are flowers, they're actually bracts, a type of leaf that aids in reproduction, usually by turning color as the plant develops true flowers. On the poinsettia, the bracts, surrounding small yellow clustered buds called cyathia, flag down pollinators just as flower petals do.\nAnd while we're talking poinsettias, let's dispel a dark myth about this cheerful holiday plant: They are not fatally toxic to children and pets. Way back in 1971, an Ohio State study determined that a 50-pound child would have to eat about 500 leaves to see any ill effects. Those ill effects? Let's just say they're of a gastrointestinal variety and leave it at that.",

One of the last great peaks of the Alps to be climbed by humans, the Matterhorn was finally summited in 1865, capping off the decade or so that's been called the 'golden age of alpinism.' The iconic peak is a daunting pyramid of stone and ice, towering just inside Switzerland's border with Italy.\nThe train goes from the village center in Zermatt (at an altitude of 5,200 feet) to the station at Gornergrat ridge (over 10,000 feet) in 33 minutes, offering incredible views along the way. The train debuted in 1898 as the world's first fully electric cog railway, connecting three existing hotels. The new attraction helped to make Zermatt a popular tourist destination, and by the time the railway began winter operations in 1929, this corner of the high Alps had become a glamorous year-round vacation hotspot.",

Together, they'll scour the woods, fields, and lakes of their respective regions (or just watch their bird feeders), to take a census of the individual birds and species they find.\nBird watchers in western Canada, Alaska, and the Northwest United States will undoubtedly find a few pine grosbeaks like the one featured in our image today. The largest member of the true finch family, it makes its nest in northern boreal forests and feeds on berries and fruits. You might identify it from its short musical warble. While the pine grosbeak mostly stays in the northern latitudes, it's an irruptive species, meaning it migrates some winters farther south to find food. Quite tame and unafraid of people, it can be easy to miss, because it'll often sit stock-still as a bird watcher walks by.

If you're not afraid of heights, you can walk the bridge that has connected these jagged rocks for almost 200 years. Originally made of wood but rebuilt with stone in 1851 to accommodate the increasing tourist traffic, Bastei Bridge offers stunning panoramic views of the river and surrounding Elbe Sandstone Mountains.

Overcoming childhood abuse, hearing loss, romantic rejection, and bouts of depression and alcoholism, Beethoven channeled his stormy emotions into music that compelled audiences to viscerally feel what he felt. In the process, he helped end the regimented Classical era and usher in the Romantic period, when even the most flawed artists were sovereign.\nThis scene at Bonn's Münsterplatz features the city's enduring Beethoven Monument (at rear), seemingly swarmed by an additional 700 green- and gold-colored Beethoven statues. Created by German conceptual artist Ottmar Hörl, the colorful statues were placed in the square last year in the run-up to the composer's birthday. Beethoven concerts and celebrations had been planned in Germany and around the world throughout 2020 in honor of this milestone anniversary.

The ornate, woody pine cones shown here are females, and they're designed to create and protect seeds. Male cones, which are usually smaller, produce pollen. The female cones open and close their scales to allow for pollination and eventually release their seeds onto the forest floor. But pine cones also open and close in response to changes in the weather, making them a natural barometer.",

In the winter, they'll migrate down to slightly lower elevations to seek shelter in subalpine forests with south-facing rocky ledges, where the sun and relentless winds keep ice to a minimum.

They then grouped them into the stone circle at Castlerigg, seen here casting shadows from the low winter sun. Archeologists believe stone circles were arranged to align with solar and lunar positions. They were used in elaborate rituals to celebrate occasions like today's winter solstice, the shortest day (and longest night) of the year in the Northern Hemisphere.\nCastlerigg is believed to be one of the oldest of the hundreds of stone circles found in Britain. And while it's not as well known as Stonehenge—which was probably begun soon after Castlerigg—its panoramic views of the neighboring Blencathra, Helvellyn, and Skiddaw mountains make it one of the most scenic. Even today, Castlerigg draws winter solstice revelers who beat drums and participate in the magical festival of Yule, in which a log is burned to symbolize the return of heat and light to the sun. And for those of you lamenting the short, cold days of winter, you can take some comfort in knowing that after today the hours of daylight will steadily lengthen, and in six months we'll have traded positions with the Southern Hemisphere and will enjoy long, warm days once again.",

This gives it protection, but a rigid body (like a candy cane!), so it swims by rapidly fanning its fins. Also like the seahorse, it's the male pipefish—not the female—who carries the eggs. After an elaborate courtship dance, the female deposits her eggs in the male's brood pouch, where they develop until the male gives birth.

		"description": "Known in North America as caribou, reindeer are built to live in freezing Arctic regions like northern Norway, where this herd was photographed under the transfixing swirl of the aurora borealis, or northern lights. Reindeer have evolved unique features that help them thrive in these harsh environments. Their noses are adapted to warm the air they breathe before it enters their lungs, which helps maintain a steady body temperature even in the coldest of weather. And most of their bodies, including their hooves, are covered with thick, dense fur to keep them well insulated. In fact, they are more likely to overheat then freeze—so when they're flying through the starry skies tonight, they'll be feeling snugger than Santa Claus in his red velvet suit.\nReindeer were introduced to Christmas lore in 1823 with the poem 'A Visit from St. Nicholas,' also known as 'The Night Before Christmas.' Written by Clement Clarke Moore, the verses paint a picture of a Santa Claus and his sleigh, driven by eight flying reindeer—Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donner, and Blitzen. In 1939, Rudolph was added to Santa's squad when Robert L. May created a story about the red-nosed misfit for his employer, Montgomery Ward, as part of a Christmas promotion for the department store.\nThe famous reindeer are often referred to as males in pop culture (except maybe Vixen?), but as the animals are typically depicted with their antlers intact, it is more likely the seasonal sleigh-pullers are female. This is because male reindeer shed their antlers at the end of the mating season in early December, while females sport their thinner antlers throughout the winter. (Castrated males follow an antler cycle that's similar to female reindeer, but we don't think Santa would go to those lengths...)",

It's the island's third-largest city, though in almost any other region, it would be considered a small town—only 4,670 people live here. Until a few years ago, Ilulissat served as a key destination for that most important holiday correspondence: Thousands of letters sent from around the world to Santa Claus, North Pole, ended up being rerouted to this giant mailbox. Today the mailbox has moved farther north, to Uummannaq, ever closer to the jolly old elf's magical domicile. If you're celebrating Christmas today, we hope you have a merry one.",

Folks with enough post-holiday energy might even slide down the hills on the grounds of this historic estate-turned public park, Barnett Demesne, in Belfast, Northern Ireland.\nBut in older traditions, December 26 was the day nobles and other property owners offered gifts to servants and employees. It's not clear if 'boxing' refers to the boxes that held these presents, or to donation boxes customarily set up for the poor on the holiday—nor if these were so much gifts as reminders of one's place on the feudal social ladder. But at any rate, as you shop the big sales and munch those tasty leftovers today, consider paying homage to Boxing Day's origins by doing a good turn for someone down on their luck.",

And if not this year (hello pandemic), maybe next?\nAfter taking in the lights, consider heading over to the rest of Nagashima Spa Land.

The cold not only provides scenic snowy views and great cross-country skiing, it's responsible for the striking red-rock pinnacles—known as hoodoos—that make the park so unique.\nHigh above sea level, winter in Bryce Canyon often sees daily shifts between freezing and above-freezing temperatures. The park's hoodoos formed as water seeped into massive stone plateaus, then froze and expanded to break away chunks of rock. Repeated day after day for eons, this process has left slim sections of sediment standing throughout Bryce Canyon—now the largest concentration of hoodoos in the world.",

Regular participants report less stress, fatigue, and chronic pain, as well as better memory function, mood, and energy levels.

What couldn't have been apparent to him then was that this cave, now known as Sơn Đoòng, is by far the world's largest by volume.\nLacking gear to explore the cave further, Khanh could only wander back home and tell friends about his discovery. But he was unable to retrace his steps to the cavern, his tracks engulfed by the jungle. Relegated to rumor, the cave went unexplored for almost two decades until a visiting team of British cavers caught wind of Khanh's tale. In 2009, Khanh led them to Sơn Đoòng after a long search, and explorations commenced that found the cave was vast beyond anyone's expectations.\nSơn Đoòng is over 1.5 billion cubic feet in volume, with its main chamber 650 feet high, almost 500 feet wide, and stretching more than 3 miles, large enough to fly a Boeing 747 through—but look out for the 15-story stalagmites. One of the cave's massive dolines—sunken, sun-exposed sections like the one seen here—hosts an entire rainforest ecosystem. And that's just what we know so far: Cave divers have yet to fully explore Sơn Đoòng's subterranean river, and the discovery of vast passages found as recently as 2019 has only added to what's known of the cave's enormity.",

The yellow neo-Gothic castle that Maximilian built to replace the earlier ruins became the summer home and hunting retreat for the king, his wife, Marie of Prussia, and their two sons, Ludwig and Otto. Hohenschwangau Castle became a kind of fantasy palace, particularly for the two young princes, who spent their time traipsing through the forest, reciting poetry, and staging scenes from the Romantic operas of Richard Wagner.\nAfter the death of King Maximilian in 1864, Ludwig ascended to the throne and moved into his father's rooms in Hohenschwangau Castle. He ordered that stars be painted onto the bedroom's ceiling and had them illuminated by hidden oil lamps. Ludwig and his successors made few other modifications, so most of the rest of the castle remains unchanged even today—the 19th-century interiors contain period furniture, and preserved on the walls are more than 90 frescoes depicting heroic German folklore and the medieval legends of Wagner's operas.",

Reaching France in their underpants, the undoubtedly chilly pilots still received a warm welcome.\nKnown worldwide as an emblem of England, the White Cliffs of Dover rise 350 feet over the strait where Blanchard and Jeffries made their crossing. The white chalk and gray-black streaks of flint match geologically with shorter cliffs on the French side—evidence of a land bridge that existed long before we primates got the notion to fly.

		"description": "In 1851, when French physicist Léon Foucault performed his pendulum experiment in Paris, he became the first to prove what many scientists of his day already suspected—that the Earth spins on an axis. He conducted his first experiments 170 years ago, in early January 1851, with a relatively small prototype in the cellar of his home. Just a month later, Foucault performed his most famous pendulum demonstration, using a 62-pound spherical weight attached to a 220-foot wire, which was hung from the dome of the Panthéon, a Parisian monument. As the pendulum swung back and forth in a fixed plane, the pointed end of the weight traced lines in a compass-like circle of sand below it. As time passed, the angle of these lines began to change, demonstrating to onlookers that the Earth itself was rotating underneath the pendulum, and by extension, everyone watching was rotating as well, spinning on the surface of the great blue marble around its axis.\nAll these years later, replicas of Foucault's pendulum can still be found in museums around the world, continuing to demonstrate this elegant scientific proof. The pendulum seen here, an exact copy of the original, has been on display at the Panthéon in Paris since 1995.",

Global warming meant that the Hudson River hadn't frozen thick enough for safe iceboating in years.\nBut beginning in the 1850s and lasting into the early 20th century, when average winter temps were colder, the Hudson Valley was the iceboating capital of the world. Speed was much of the allure. Supported by metal blades ('runners'), like skates, an iceboat encounters little forward resistance, enabling it to glide over the ice at thrilling speeds. In iceboating's heyday, wealthy yachtsmen raced their iceboats over the frozen Hudson as thousands of spectators watched along the riverbanks. In 1885, John Aspinwall Roosevelt, President Franklin D. Roosevelt's uncle, founded the Hudson River Ice Yacht Club, which still exists today.

It's a highlight of the Ruta de las Cascadas (Route of the Waterfalls), a popular circuit of the many waterfalls and hot springs near the mountain town of Baños de Agua Santa.\nBaños, as it's better known, is in the shadow of Tungurahua, one of South America's most active volcanoes. The once-sleepy town has become a gateway to the Amazon for outdoor adventurers who love to hike, zip line, rock climb, or bike down the mountain to this roaring cascade in the verdant jungle. Pro tip: Bring a rain jacket. The best way to experience the awesome power of The Devil's Cauldron is to walk onto a swaying suspension bridge and then follow the steep steps down the mountainside, around and behind the roaring curtain of water, literally soaking in the view.",

		"description": "This inscription marks the spot on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, DC, where civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr. stood while delivering his famous 'I Have a Dream' speech. It was August 28, 1963, and King was addressing a quarter-million people spread across the National Mall during the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. King referred to written notes for most of the speech, but as he neared the end of his prepared remarks, he heard gospel singer Mahalia Jackson, who was standing nearby, shout out, 'Tell them about the dream, Martin!' King responded by partly improvising the rest of his message in a soaring, sermon-like delivery, punctuating his ideas repeatedly with that single phrase, 'I have a dream.' King's dream for racial justice, so eloquently shared that day, would resonate through the crowd and across the nation, bringing passionate new energy to the civil rights movement. It still resonates today.\nOn Martin Luther King Jr. Day, volunteers across the country will honor Dr. King's legacy by working for racial and economic justice in our time. It was made a federal holiday in 1983, and in 1994 Congress designated Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a national day of service, inviting citizens to observe the holiday by improving their communities.",

		"description": "Deep in the jungle of southern Mexico lie the ruins of a city that thrived for centuries before it was abandoned more than 1,000 years ago. Calakmul was once one of the two dueling superpowers—along with Tikal—of the Classic Maya civilization. At its height, around 1,200 years ago, the city of Calakmul had a population of about 50,000 people, but the kingdom as a whole numbered more than 1.5 million. Archaeologists have uncovered 6,750 structures here—the largest is this pyramid temple, called, simply, 'Structure 2.' It's one of the tallest and most massive remaining structures from that highly advanced culture. The ruins of the city proper cover nearly 8 square miles in the jungle and the kingdom once ruled over settlements as far as 90 miles away.\nAll the more amazing, then, that Calakmul was apparently lost to history until an American botanist named Cyrus L. Lundell discovered it when flying over the jungle on a survey of the area in December 1931. A few expeditions were sent to explore it over the next few years, but it went largely unstudied until the 1980s. Calakmul is now recognized as one of the most important archeological sites in southern Mexico.",

Actually, these gentoo penguins on Danco Island, just off the Antarctic Peninsula, were photographed leaping out of the water as they returned to their nests for breeding season, which starts in November.\nJust as other birds are aerodynamically shaped, penguin bodies are aquadynamic, able to glide through water thanks to their streamlined shape and flipper-like wings. Gentoos are the fastest penguins, and can swim up to 22 mph. While most birds have hollow bones to help them stay aloft, penguin bones grow solid as they mature into adults. The added weight of the dense bones helps the birds stay submerged as they dive into the cold Antarctic waters in search of tasty seafood.",

In 1903, Potter published 'The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin,' about a cheeky squirrel who taunts an owl with silly riddles until he pushes things too far—narrowly escaping with his life, minus a tail. Potter based Nutkin on the red squirrel, the only native squirrel species in the UK. The red squirrel population saw a steep decline here after humans introduced the larger nonnative Eastern gray squirrel in the late 1800s. But today in the UK, the red squirrel is a protected species, bolstering efforts to keep the gray numbers in check and preserve habitat. Estimates put the red squirrel population in the UK at fewer than 140,000, with the vast majority living in the woods of Scotland, like our little friend here.\nJoin us in going nutty for the red squirrel—and squirrels everywhere—for today is Squirrel Appreciation Day.",

But it was Henrik Ibsen, the Norwegian master playwright, who brought the word into Nordic popular culture in the 1850s, imbuing it with national pride and folk spirituality.

		"description": "Is it possible for an article of clothing to express the essence of an entire people? Well, not usually, but for the Indigenous Guna people of Panama, the colorful handwoven textiles seen here may be an exception. Molas, which means 'clothing' in the Guna language, are traditionally displayed on both the front and back of women's blouses. Even today, many Guna women prefer to wear them instead of modern attire. The textiles often feature abstract geometric patterns, as well as images from nature such as turtles, flowers, birds, and fish. Guna women of yesteryear were known to paint their bodies with those same geometric patterns and designs, and by the late 1800s they had begun weaving them onto cloth instead of painting themselves. Today, the production of molas is still generally done by women, who use an intricate process called reverse appliqué, where as many as seven layers of fabric are sewn together to form a panel, which is then hand-cut to create the vibrant designs.\nBut the importance of molas to the Guna people runs deeper than mere fashion. Forced from Colombia by Spanish colonists in the 16th century, the Guna endured an arduous migration before settling in what's now known as Guna Yala, a semi-autonomous archipelago of coral islands in Panama. In the early 20th century, they again found themselves at odds with local authorities. The Panamanian government, in an attempt to westernize the Guna people, objected to their wearing of molas and other traditional garb. This resulted in an uprising in which the Guna finally won the political independence they enjoy today. To many Guna, the mola is not just a craft, but a symbol of their autonomy.",

Here we see it puffing up its plumage to insulate its body against the wintry weather. Unrelated to the American robin, the European robin is commonly known in the British Isles as the robin redbreast. But it's more orange than red, you say? That's because when British people first named it the redbreast, probably in the 1400s, the word 'orange' had not yet been introduced as a color name in the English language. Animals and other things were often named 'red' even when orange or tawny: the red deer, Red Planet, and robin redbreast are all examples. Whatever you decide to call our diminutive friend, we appreciate its bright splash of color on an otherwise bleak wintry day.\nThis weekend, around half a million people in the UK are expected to take part in the Big Garden Birdwatch, and it's likely that many will spy European robins, which are widely distributed across the British Isles. One of the world's largest wildlife surveys, the Big Garden Birdwatch has been sponsored by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) for over 40 years. Participants spend just one hour in a garden, local park, or even on an apartment balcony and record the highest number of each bird species they see. By comparing data trends over the years, the RSPB can monitor the health of bird populations and better understand the challenges faced by wildlife.",

This stunning image of the museum looks out through its intricate, bronze-colored façade to the National Mall. The museum’s breathtaking exterior, a corona rising in three dramatic tiers, evokes the crowns found in the Yoruba art of West Africa, and its ornate design echoes the decorative ironwork found in the American South, often forged by African American slaves and freed Black Americans. The façade allows natural light to filter into the museum while also protecting artifacts on display from direct sunlight and glare.\nFor a century, people dreamed of a place on the National Mall to commemorate the contributions of African Americans. It began with Black Civil War veterans and continued with champions of the project like US Rep. John Lewis. The dream was realized in 2016 when NMAAHC finally opened. It tells the story of America through an African American lens with a robust collection of artifacts, programs, and educational material. While helping create the museum as its founding director, I heeded the words of the African American scholar and creator of Black History Month, Carter G. Woodson, who said, 'The only reason I do history is to make America better.'\nWhen Woodson and the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History declared that 'Negro History Week' would be celebrated the second week of February 1926, they continued a long tradition of Black communities recognizing the month that contains the birthdays of Abraham Lincoln (February 12) and Frederick Douglass (February 14). In 1976, the observance was expanded to the entire month and was celebrated throughout the country. Today, the opportunities to study African American history are more abundant than ever. And Black History Month is just as relevant as it was when Woodson created it, because there is no more powerful force than a people steeped in their history, and no higher cause than honoring the struggle of our ancestors by remembering. – Lonnie G.

Another important legacy of the treaty is that it provided the framework for political relations between New Zealand's government and the Indigenous Māori people.\nPerhaps nothing symbolizes negotiations between those two parties better than the land you see here, which has been preserved as a national park since 1953. Our image shows the glacier-capped peak of Mount Sefton, one of the many tall mountains here in the Southern Alps. Just a few miles away towers New Zealand's tallest peak, originally called Aoraki by the Māori, who named it after a mythological figure. The mountain was given its English name, Mount Cook, in 1851, in honor of Captain James Cook, the British explorer who circumnavigated and mapped the country in the 1770s. An agreement in 1998 between the government and Māori leaders officially renamed both the peak and the park to Aoraki/Mount Cook.

		"description": "Towering above Atlanta's Sweet Auburn district is this 65-foot-high mural of John Lewis, the civil rights icon. What better way to celebrate Black History Month than to honor Lewis, a son of sharecroppers who carried the struggles of the civil rights movement from the Jim Crow South to the halls of Congress? An Alabama native, Lewis moved to Atlanta in 1963. He was already famous and would become even more so for leading marches, protests, and sit-ins throughout the South. Beaten by police, the KKK, and angry mobs, Lewis never wavered from his belief in nonviolent protest. He famously fought with his voice and peaceful actions, never his fists.\nWhen this mural was dedicated in 2012, Lewis joined muralist Sean Schwab in adding the final touch to the work of art. He painted the dot over the 'I' in his last name and reflected on his life's work as an activist. 'Growing up in a little town in southeast Alabama, I never would have dreamed that there would be a mural of me on the side of a building in Atlanta that is so big it could be seen from the highway,' he said. Lewis died on July 17, 2020. Other murals of Lewis have since gone up in other cities, including Rochester, New York, and Birmingham, Alabama.",

		"description": "When the sky is clear, and the moon hangs low in the horizon, you can sometimes spot a halo around it, like the one captured in this image from Hug Point Falls on the Oregon coast. And occasionally within that halo, you may also see a bright spot that appears to be a second moon. No, it's not the moon's long-lost twin, but an optical phenomenon called a paraselene, more commonly referred to as a moon dog or mock moon. This 'false' moon can appear when the real moon is at least a quarter visible and is bright enough for its light to refract off hexagonal plate-shaped ice crystals floating in the atmosphere. Moon dogs are more commonly seen in winter months, when ice crystals are more prevalent in the clouds.\nThe moon dog is the lunar equivalent of a sun dog, also known as a parhelion, and both appear as part of a related optical phenomenon called a 22-degree halo. Halos like these are also caused by crystal refraction in the atmosphere, and named for their apparent radius of 22 degrees, or about 10 diameters outside the moon and sun. A 22-degree halo is said to be visible up to 100 times per year, much more common than a rainbow.",

		"description": "If these frozen formations were named by more literal minds, we might know them as simply 'reverse icicles.' But the Andes, including this mountain pass rising above Chile's Atacama Desert, were mapped by poetically inclined Spanish explorers. They likened formations like these to a congregation of penitent parishioners kneeling at mass: hence the common name 'penitentes' for such packed-snow pinnacles.\nMaybe the most dramatic pentitentes appear in dry sections of the Andes, but they can form anywhere the sun beats down on snow enough to vaporize it faster than it can melt into water. Since snow isn't a perfectly even surface, some patches of the snowpack turn to vapor faster than others, creating pits that further reflect sunlight upon themselves. This speeds vaporization within the pits, deepening them often all the way to bare earth, with unmelted portions of snow in between left standing (or kneeling) as penitentes.",

Almond orchards are a thriving $6 billion business here in the valley. California produces around 80% of the world's almonds and booming demand means production has more than doubled in the past few years, despite threats from drought and wildfires.\nTo keep up with that demand, orchards pay American beekeepers from as far away as Florida to truck in their hives each February when the trees are in bloom. More than half of the US domesticated honey bee population is needed to work the orchards. Next time you gobble down a handful of almonds, think of the humble honey bee. Without bees, there would be no almonds.",

(The other two are the western and mountain.) The eastern bluebird range covers a wide area—east of the Rocky Mountains from southern Canada down to Central America, then over to the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico. You can spot them in grasslands, forest clearings, meadows, and the like.\nAll bluebirds are cavity nesters, which means they make their homes in the hollows of trees, in holes vacated by bigger birds like woodpeckers, and in artificial nests called nest boxes. Nest boxes played a big role in helping the eastern bluebird population rebound after a precipitous decline in the early 20th century due to habitat loss and the introduction of nonnative species that out-competed them for nesting holes. Enter conservation groups and passionate backyard birders. They put up nest boxes specifically designed for bluebirds that provided needed shelter for these colorful thrushes.\nThis conservation success story makes the eastern bluebird the perfect mascot for the Great Backyard Bird Count, an online citizen science project sponsored by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and the National Audubon Society that helps monitor wild bird populations. Want to participate? Just count the birds you see in your area and share the results online between February 12-15, 2021. Happy birding!",

Kennedy's administration to support new civil rights legislation.

		"description": "While the purple flowers and green ironwork may not look overly festive to the untrained eye, residents of New Orleans will no doubt spot the significance of both, especially today, on Mardi Gras, the final day of Carnival. Purple and green are two of the three official colors of Mardi Gras, together with gold, and in a normal year the streets would be full of revelers decked out in all three colors as they dance and parade down the streets of the city. Due to COVID-19, there won't be any parades this year, but the colors will still be on full display in the city's famous French Quarter and elsewhere, including as colorful icing atop king cakes, a beloved treat that's associated with the Carnival season.\nThe colors themselves have officially been part of Mardi Gras since 1872, when they were introduced by the newly formed Krewe of Rex, one of the private social clubs ('krewes') that stage parades and other Carnival festivities. The krewe's ceremonial King of Carnival ('Rex') proclaimed that gold represents power, green represents faith, and purple stands for justice.\nThe ironwork seen here is a characteristic feature of homes and buildings in the region. It traces back to the early 18th century, when slaves and freemen from West Africa, influenced by French and Spanish styles, crafted fences, gates, and railings from cast iron. The often elaborately ornamented designs adorn verandas and balconies, giving residents a pleasant place to cool off in the muggy Louisiana heat. In true New Orleans fashion, even the architecture reflects a blend of cultural influences that make the city so wonderful and unique.",

These thick-bodied fish have large scales and a beak of fused teeth they use to diligently scrape delicious algae from reefs and rocks. Some also eat coral, which they grind up with plate-like teeth in their throats. Researchers say parrotfish play a critical role in the health of coral reefs by eating algae that can choke off coral growth. They also help replenish the white sandy beaches near these tropical reefs. How? After parrotfish digest the edible parts of coral, they excrete what's left as sand—a lot of sand. In some species, a single parrotfish can poop almost 1,000 pounds of pearly white sand each year. But never mind that—some trivia is best not to dwell on.",

		"description": "Of all the camera-wielding luminaries who've snapped this eastward view of Yosemite Valley, few can hold a 'candela' to Ansel Adams, born this day in 1902. The legendary photographer of Western landscapes was given his first camera here in Yosemite as a boy. The national park was his favorite place in the world, and he returned every year for the rest of his life.\nAdams' style is one of the most recognizable in photography: Bright whites against deep blacks, with high horizon lines that leave most of the frame filled with landscape, a narrow lens aperture placing every tiny detail in biting focus. Unlike many photographers of the day who considered themselves more journalist than artist, Adams was a visionary: Instead of plainly documenting what he saw, Adams aimed to convey the enchantment, awe, and terror his beloved landscapes made him feel, spending hours in the darkroom fine-tuning exposures to match what he visualized. 'Clearing Winter Storm'—the photo that today's image pays tribute to—was taken around 1937, depicting ominous clouds gathering around El Capitan and Bridalveil Fall, whiting out the distant peak of Half Dome.\nWhile Adams had to lug bulky box cameras and light meters into the wilderness to capture his vision, chances are you've got the whole setup in your pocket. Why not grab that phone of yours, venture outside, and celebrate this legendary shutterbug's birthday with some masterful nature snaps of your own?",

These waterfowl are among the largest freshwater bird species in the world, with wingspans stretching as wide as 11 feet. Dalmatian pelicans generally breed during the first four months of the year, building their nests on or near the ground, and sometimes upon vegetation floating in water. While breeding, they form monogamous pairs, though they generally don't pair up for life.\nOnce breeding season is over, these social birds are on the move, but their annual migrations don’t follow consistent patterns—their travels may find them anywhere from Eastern Europe to Central Asia, Russia to the Indian subcontinent. They travel in search of food, hunting mostly fish and small amphibians. Dalmatians are strong swimmers and fliers, and are said to be meticulous groomers, spending a lot of time preening and splash-bathing themselves between migrations. Unfortunately, because of poaching and shrinking natural habitats, these beautiful birds are endangered, with only 10,000 to 20,000 thought to be remaining in the world.",

The ratification of the 19th Amendment, on August 18, 1920, finally secured the legal right of women to vote, but this mainly benefited white women. Despite heroic contributions to achieve suffrage, Black, Indigenous, and other women of color continued to face barriers to voting in the form of poll taxes, restrictive local laws, and hostile intimidation. This mosaic, called 'Our Story: Portraits of Change,' attempts to show a more complex history of the fight for American women's right to vote.\nWe're seeing just a small detail of the mosaic—in all, some 5,000 photographs were spread across 1,000 square feet on the terminal floor in August to mark the 100th anniversary of women's suffrage. When viewers stepped back to observe the mosaic from a distance, they saw a very large portrait of African American suffragist and anti-lynching activist Ida B. Wells. (Click on the image above to see the full portrait.) The detail here depicts one of Wells' eyes.\nAs a journalist and publisher, Wells was an unflinching critic of racial injustice, particularly lynching.

		"description": "It's nearly autumn in Chile, where signs of the season vary widely as one travels from the Atacama Desert in the north more than 2,600 miles south to the tip of Tierra del Fuego. Around halfway between these two extremes you can find Conguillío National Park and the volcano Llaima at Chile's center. In March, at the start of the Southern Hemisphere's autumn, the leaves of the deciduous forest begin to turn color and fall, and the native Chilean pine trees (Araucaria araucana) stand out even more strikingly.\nBecause of their distinctive appearance and the fact that they thrive in a wide range of climates, Chilean pine trees became a favorite of botanists in the 19th century, who transported and cultivated them in many temperate areas around the world. Also known as 'monkey puzzle' trees, they got this whimsical common name in the 1850s when English barrister Charles Austin observed, 'It would be a puzzle for a monkey to climb that.' Even more amazing is that these trees can live over a thousand years and are themselves living fossils, descended from a lineage stretching back 260 million years to the time of the dinosaurs.",

The theme of this year's WWD is 'Forests and Livelihoods: Sustaining People and Planet.' Through a series of virtual events, and a panel at UN headquarters, UN representatives and partner wildlife groups will examine the links between the state of our planet's forests and woodlands and efforts to preserve the millions of livelihoods that directly depend on them. A particular emphasis will be placed on the role of Indigenous peoples who still live and work in forested areas, how they've successfully managed their forest ecosystems for centuries, and what that can teach us about sustainability.\nThe pair of tree-climbing lions you see here in Lake Nakuru National Park in Kenya are among the many forest animals whose very existence is threatened by the encroachment of people into their habitats. While lions themselves are not yet considered endangered, they are listed as 'vulnerable,' and many conservationists fear that only sanctuaries like this one surrounding Lake Nakuru are keeping the lion population from becoming completely unsustainable.",

Whether its resemblance to a comma (or is that an apostrophe?) was intentional or not, it's a fine visual for today's syntactical celebration. That's correct: It's Grammar Day! (Note to hardline grammarians: We know punctuation—like a comma—isn't exactly grammar, but we're loosening the linguistical reins a bit in the generous spirit of Grammar Day. So put that red pen down, smarty-pants.)\nIf you're not inclined to decline nouns or dying to diagram a sentence, don't quit reading just yet. You might just think of grammar as the dos and don'ts taught in English textbooks—but a mere stuffy set of rules it ain't. Grammar is the ingredients of a language. Whenever we speak or even think, whether with prim-and-proper diction or in the most teacher-defying slang, our brains are using grammatical rules to translate firing neurons into words and phrases. Just how this happens is still a hot debate for linguists: Are these rules based on hardwired neural pathways or are they learned from a young age?\nWell, however the brain works, we hope you brought yours today. Our quiz covers those wonderful, nitpicky grammar rules from school you doubtless remember so well. Sharpen your pencils!",

		"description": "If you like your landscapes on the surreal side, then this weird and wonderful river in the Andalusia region of southwestern Spain should be to your liking. The Rio Tinto (Red River) gets its name from the reddish hue of its water, caused by high levels of iron and sulfur, which make it very acidic. This unusual chemical makeup may or may not be a result of the area's long history of mining, which dates back at least 5,000 years. Ancient residents like the Tartessians and Romans dug here for copper, silver, and gold, as well as the mineral pyrite, commonly referred to as 'fool's gold.' Legend has it that the Rio Tinto was the site of the fabled mines of King Solomon.\nBecause of the river’s extreme acidity, almost nothing can live in it. Only a thriving community of unusual microorganisms—classified as extremophiles—can survive the water's acidic mix, by feeding on the minerals alone. The strangeness of Rio Tinto's ecology has even attracted the attention of NASA, which studied the bacteria that have adapted to this highly acidic environment because the conditions resemble those on the surface of Mars.",

Other symbols in the mural include Lady Liberty, the ceiling of the Library of Congress, and some black-eyed Susan flowers that are said to represent justice.

Also known as Yancuic Xihuitl, the Aztec New Year is still celebrated by some Indigenous Nahua communities here in central Mexico with songs, dances, and the flames of 'ocote' (pitch pine) candles. Dancers wear colorful traditional costumes topped by quetzal feather headdresses, and celebrants greet the new year by making loud noises with seashells, just as Aztecs did centuries ago. It's one of the many expressions of pre-Columbian tradition that managed to survive the Spanish conquest and modern erosion of Indigenous customs.\nThe Pyramid of the Sun is the largest structure in the ancient city that Aztecs called Teotihuacan (which means, roughly, 'birthplace of the gods'). The 8-square-mile site also contains other important pyramids, plazas, temples, palaces, and a complex network of underground tunnels. As grand a city as it once was, when the Aztecs arrived here in the 1400s, Teotihuacan had been abandoned for centuries. Its precise origins are a mystery, but it was first built by an unknown civilization sometime around 400 BCE. By 400 CE, Teotihuacan had become a center of industry and trade, the largest and most powerful city in the Americas and probably the sixth largest in the world. But by around 550 CE, its major monuments were sacked and deliberately burned, the magnificent pyramids and temples deserted—at least until the Aztecs arrived.",

You remember pi from geometry class: It expresses the ratio of the distance around a circle to the distance across it. So it was essential to ancient astronomers who mapped these celestial workings, as well as to designers of intricate machines that simulate the circling heavens.\nWow, you kept reading through all the math talk?

When it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere, those of us above the equator are tilted away from the sun, giving us shorter days and longer nights. In summer, we're tilted toward the sun, but the equinox is right in between. It's the moment during Earth's annual revolution around the sun when its axis is neither tilting away nor tilting toward the sun, giving everyone on the planet an equal split of day and night.

		"description": "A satellite view of the Mania River in Madagascar allows us to see a curious cloud pattern. It's common for cool, moist marine air to rise and form dense clouds over bodies of water, then for the clouds to evaporate as they drift over warmer, drier land. The opposite is happening here: Puffs of clouds are forming over land, but not over water. That's because Madagascar's tropical rainforests are warm and wet enough that evaporating moisture rises as the day heats up. When it rises high enough, the moisture encounters cooler air, which condenses the water into clouds. Generally speaking, clouds will form where the air is rising, which in this case is only over the land. Above the river, the air is cooler and descending, so no clouds are forming there.\nIf learning about an unusual weather pattern puts you on cloud nine, then join the United Nations in celebrating World Meteorological Day today. The UN created the annual observance back in 1950 as a day to recognize the contributions of meteorologists to our safety and well-being. We may not all know our cirrus from our cumulus, but we can at least thank meteorologists for letting us know if we should pack an umbrella or sunscreen.",

		"description": "The family drama you see playing out here in the Pacific Ocean near Maui, Hawaii, is a humpback whale calf getting a little nudge from its mom. She presumably wants the sleepy youngster to practice surfacing, something these amazing marine mammals are famous for doing in dramatic fashion. Winter is calving season for the Hawaiian population of humpbacks. Thousands arrive from their feeding grounds in the North Pacific to swim and breed in the warm Hawaiian waters, making them a common sight from November until April. Because they're known to hang around near the ocean's surface, breaching or slapping the water with their tails, humpbacks are a favorite of whale watchers everywhere.\nMost humpbacks are nomadic and can be found in all the oceans of the world, with some populations migrating distances of up to 5,000 miles as they move from breeding grounds in warmer tropical waters, to colder areas where food is more plentiful. And when they eat, they don't mess around, consuming up to 2,000 pounds of food each day. They eat tiny crustaceans called krill, as well as small fish. Once on the verge of extinction because of commercial whaling, legislative protections in the US and around the world have helped the humpback population to rebound to somewhere around 80,000 worldwide.",

		"description": "The red clay formations called Las Médulas owe their angular character not to the shaping hands of nature but to those of gold miners—and not grizzled '49ers in grubby flannel and overalls, but 1st-century excavators clad in tattered tunics. When gold seams were discovered here in what's now northern Spain, the Romans who controlled the region created a clever system of tunnels and canals under the hills, through which they channeled water from nearby streams to build pressure that cracked away huge chunks of clay.\nAs the gold was exposed and extracted over more than a century of mining, rolling hills were transformed into an open pit flanked by cliffs and crags. But once the gold was exhausted and the workers went home, Mother Nature—not to be outdone—began adding her own artistic finish, and her verdant woods have long since reclaimed the once-bare hills.",

Covering over 623 square miles in the interior of the island, the park is home to an incredible diversity of flora and fauna. Marsupials like Bennett's wallabies, quolls, Tasmanian pademelons, wombats, Tasmanian pygmy possums, and the legendary Tasmanian devils, as well as short-beaked echidnas and platypuses, can be found in its ancient forests and lakes.\nIn late April and into May, locals and visitors delight in the 'Turning of the Fagus,' when the leaves of the deciduous Tasmanian beech trees turn brilliant yellow, orange, and red. The Overland Track, a 40-mile trail through the park, is a challenging but popular route for experienced trekkers, whether they're exploring a portion of it over a day or taking a week to complete the entire route. Overnight hikers can stay in warming huts built along the way, and spend the night dazzled by the stars and the aurora australis (aka the southern lights) in one of the island's best stargazing locations.",

		"description": "The mountain hare is doubly hard to catch sight of, because along with its tremendous speed, it's terrifically well camouflaged. These two traits help the iconic species survive in the rugged mountains and uplands of northern Europe and Asia—this hare is dashing across a heath in the Scottish Highlands. When they have to, these speedy leporids can dart away as fast as 50 mph, at least for short distances, allowing them to outrun predators and disappear safely into the heather. But a would-be predator may not even spy them to begin with—mountain hares change coats, or molt, several times a year, their fur going from brown and gray in summer, to white-gray in winter, helping them to blend into their surroundings whatever the season.\nUnlike their rabbit cousins, hares don't burrow underground or sleep communally in warrens, but instead live and rest above ground in small nest-like depressions called forms. Hares are born fully formed, with fur grown out and eyes wide open, on the lookout for danger. When the spring breeding season arrives, mountain hares undergo a drastic change in personality, from skittish and easily spooked, to frenzied, lovestruck animals on the hunt for mates. In their delirium, the hares will sometimes 'box' each other by striking out with their forepaws. Males may occasionally battle each other for dominance and attention, but more often it's females that box, to fend off overly aggressive suitors or to test their resolve. These antics have become so famous, they are said to have inspired the idiom, 'mad as a March hare.'",

In under a week—just add water!—the seeds sprout and develop into dense, leafy growths that allow the elephant to conveniently camouflage itself as it wanders the savanna.

Located in the sparsely populated northeast corner of Brazil, this park gets far too much annual rainfall—nearly 50 inches—to be considered a desert. In fact, heavy rain is part of what makes this place unique: Nearly 70% of its annual rainfall comes between January and May, filling the park's nearly 40,000 lagoons to the brim with fresh rainwater. Why doesn't the water sink into the sand? A layer of impermeable bedrock beneath the dunes prevents that from happening.\nDespite its remote location, the park, established in 1981, has become a popular destination for ecotourists. They come partly to see the many kinds of animals and plants that manage to thrive here, including several endangered species. One of the park's most famous inhabitants is the predatory wolf fish. It lies dormant during the dry season by burying itself in layers of wet mud in the lagoons, only to reemerge to snack on unsuspecting prey as the pools refill with the rains.",

Russia's largest island, Sakhalin lies off the mainland's Far East coast, due north of the Japanese island of Hokkaido. The island was hotly contested by both Russia and Japan in the 19th and early 20th centuries. In the late 1930s, when the Aniva Lighthouse was built, Russia controlled the northern half of Sakhalin while Japan controlled this, the southern part—so it was a team from Japan that built this lighthouse.\nConstruction was a staggeringly complex endeavor on this tiny rock amid the turbulent seas of the North Pacific. But beginning in June 1937, the engineers and workers managed to overcome innumerable obstacles, and by October 1939 they had completed this nine-story, 100-foot tower. Lightkeepers braved harsh weather, but the lighthouse itself was relatively comfortable. Aside from a kitchen, radio room, and equipment room, the living quarters were spread across three floors and could accommodate up to 12 people. The lightkeepers left in the 1990s after Aniva Lighthouse became fully automated, powered by a nuclear system. But when that power source was depleted in 2006, the lighthouse was abandoned, and now it's being slowly reclaimed by nature.",

Eggs have long been a symbol of rebirth and spring, and the sight of colorful eggs hung by ribbon can melt even the coldest of hearts.\nThis Ostereierbaum is perhaps the most famous Easter egg tree in all of Europe. Volker and Christa Kraft of Saalfeld, Germany, started decorating this apple tree in 1965, when it was just a sapling and could only hold 18 plastic eggs. Flash-forward to the 21st century, when more than 10,000 blown and painted eggs decorated the fully grown tree. Sadly, the Krafts ended their tradition in 2015, but the memories of the glorious Ostereierbaum live on in photographs such as this one.",

(The original games were held at least as far back as 776 BCE and probably earlier.) The 1896 Games were held in the Panathenaic Stadium, in the shadow of the Acropolis of Athens, shown here. Those newly revived games of 1896 included athletes from 14 countries, with the largest delegations from Greece, Germany, France, and Great Britain. The 43 events included a marathon, tennis, cycling, fencing, shooting, Greco-Roman wrestling, and swimming. And while some things haven't changed over the years, some were pretty different back then. Swimmers were taken out to sea by boat for the longer races and had to swim back to shore. Winners were given a silver medal (copper for second place), as well as an olive branch and a diploma.\nThis is a unique time for the Olympics. We can look forward to the postponed 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games in Tokyo (now scheduled to start in July 2021) as well as the Winter Games in Beijing in 2022. The Beijing Games will feature a mascot panda named Bing Dwen Dwen—and we swear we had nothing to do with it. 'Bing' means ice and symbolizes purity and strength, and 'Dwen Dwen' represents children. After the postponement of 2020, we can't wait to hear, 'Let the games begin!'",

Straddling the southern Colorado-Utah border, Hovenweep is so remote that almost no artificial light disturbs the view of star-filled skies. The dazzling nightscapes are little different from those seen by the Ancestral Puebloans who built these towers. They were a farming culture who first settled in the area roughly 1,100 years ago. By the late 1200s they numbered around 2,500 people and had built these and other structures in six different villages. Archaeologists offer several theories to explain the use of the buildings. Some may have been defensive fortifications, storage areas, homes, or any combination of these. But researchers suggest that the tower called Hovenweep Castle, seen here, was almost certainly used as a celestial observatory.\nThat's why we're visiting Hovenweep during International Dark Sky Week, which lasts through the weekend. Organizers of the event, held during the week of the new moon in April, encourage us to observe the beauty of the night sky without light pollution. It's easy to do here—in 2014, the International Dark-Sky Association named Hovenweep a Dark Sky Park, offering protections that preserve the extraordinarily pristine skies that once shone down on the Ancestral Puebloans.",

Wat Phra Si Sanphet, shown here, was the holiest shrine in the capital of that kingdom, a royal temple containing a 52-foot-tall golden statue of the Buddha, among other treasures. The first king of Ayutthaya, Ramathibodi I, ordered construction of a royal palace here in 1350. Nearly a century later, the palace was moved to a different location in the city and the former palace grounds were converted to a holy site.\nThe bell-shaped structures in the image, called chedis, are believed to have housed the ashes of three Ayutthayan kings. After serving as the seat of the kingdom for 417 years, the capital city of Ayutthaya was sacked in 1767 by the invading Burmese, who melted down the copious gold of the temples and palaces, then set the buildings on fire. All but these three chedis were completely destroyed, and over time they fell into ruin. Restoration began on the chedis in 1956, but only the foundations of the rest of the complex remain.\nWe're featuring these ruins because today is Songkran, Thailand's traditional—though not official—new year and very popular water festival. What began as a ritual of pouring water over statues of the Buddha and each other as a way to signify purification and the washing away of sin and bad luck, has become a good-natured, multiday water fight enjoyed across the nation.",

Gaze at a Dalí and you may find yourself gripped with a strange sense of familiarity, like your subconscious has visited this strange place before. But what if you could literally step into a huge Dalí piece?\nThis odd, ostentatious building in Dalí's hometown of Figueres, Spain, is exactly that. Fully imagined and designed by the artist himself, the Dalí Theatre-Museum is built on the ruins of the town's former municipal theater, where a precocious 14-year-old Dalí once had his first exhibition. 'The people who come to see it will leave with the sensation of having had a theatrical dream,' said Dalí, and his design delivers. The Theatre-Museum is a labyrinthine guided tour exploring Dalí's artistic growth and his wild ways of thinking—it features 1,500-plus Dalí originals from all stages of his career, as well as collected works by artists who inspired him. Some might even say it houses the specter of the great surrealist: Dalí himself is buried in a crypt below the building.",

This incredible view is of the New River Gorge Bridge, which, when completed in 1977, was the world's highest bridge carrying a regular roadway. It held that distinction for 24 years and is now a popular attraction for BASE jumpers and rappelers.\nFar below the bridge is the New River, which—despite its name—is thought to be one of the oldest rivers in the world. Its exact age is unknown, but geologists believe the New River is a remnant of a section from the ancient Teays River, which once flowed several million years ago. Today, rafters and kayakers come to ride the New River rapids, which can reach a level of Class V, which means they're among the most difficult waters to navigate.\nYou can enjoy this new park year-round for free—there are no entrance fees. And today, to mark the first day of National Park Week, all national parks are offering free admission.",

		"description": "Today we're in Montalbano Elicona on the island of Sicily. The town is known for the very old castle at the crest of the hill, as well as the quaint medieval village below. It's no wonder that Montalbano Elicona has been called one of the most beautiful towns in all of Italy. The castle itself was built in the early 13th century by medieval power broker Frederick II of Swabia. He wore many hats, including King of Sicily, Holy Roman Emperor, and—as far-fetched as it sounds—King of Jerusalem, a title he claimed after conquering that city during the Sixth Crusade. The castle was originally designed as a fortress, but it also served as a summer residence for Frederick and rulers who followed him.\nSurrounding the castle are several other interesting historical sites, including the 14th-century Church of St. Catherine, known for its Romanesque facade as well as its mix of other elements from Catalan and Renaissance architectural styles. Also of note is the nearby Argimusco plateau, where an array of large oblong rocks, including one that is said to resemble an eagle, have long prompted speculation that they were placed there by members of a prehistoric island culture. However, scientists now believe that these so-called megaliths of Argimusco, sometimes referred to as the Stonehenge of Sicily, are actually of natural origin, and the unique boulder shapes are simply the result of centuries of wind erosion.",

Planted in the ground at individual homes or along the sides of roads and decorated with coconut leaves and flowers, penjor are used to hang offerings as a kind gesture towards the spirits. The tenth and final day of Galungan is called Kuningan, and comes on April 24 this year. To mark this finale, a specially prepared yellow rice will be offered to the departing ancestors, a gift to accompany them on their return journey to the spirit world.",

Anyone who has flown in the window seat of an airplane and gazed down at Earth below might wonder why the colors in this image look so unreal. That's because they are. This image was taken in 2013 by Landsat 7, a NASA satellite that uses thermal infrared sensors to help scientists better distinguish flora, fauna, water, and manmade objects. For almost 50 years, NASA has been using satellite imagery to understand how climate change and population growth are affecting our fragile planet. These satellites help NASA see where deforestation and wildfires are happening, where glaciers are melting, and how rising waters are encroaching on cities.\nThe biggest cause of these changes? According to NASA, it's us. Since the first Landsat launched in 1972, the Earth's population has almost doubled, from 4 billion people then to 7.8 billion today. But there is some good news to mark this Earth Day: The Mississippi River we see here is much less toxic now than it was back in 1972, thanks to environmental laws and regulations.",

This 1,235-square-mile stretch of land where the Mojave and Colorado Deserts converge was declared a national monument in 1936, then was redesignated a national park in 1994. That status protects a wide variety of plant and animal life, including the eponymous Joshua tree, which can be found growing mostly in the hills on the Mojave side of the park.\nThe Cholla Cactus Garden, seen here, lies near the center of the park in what is called the Pinto Basin. Visitors can safely navigate this prickly section via a nature trail that allows a close-up view of a large collection of cholla cactus, which is spread out over 10 acres. This plant may look fuzzy from afar and is sometimes even sardonically referred to as the teddy bear cholla, but you don't want to snuggle with one—or even touch it at all. The cholla cactus is recognizable by its dense yellow new-growth spines, which grow on top of dark lower trunks. Stem-joints from cholla cactus fall off easily and the spines have tiny barbs that can latch onto your skin and be painful to remove. We'll just admire them from a distance, thank you very much.",

Huge colonies of Adélies were once spread throughout the Antarctic Peninsula and the coastline of the continent, but as climate change took hold, populations declined in some areas.

		"description": "Ahh, the pastoral countryside of the Yorkshire Dales in Northern England. Dewy mornings, grazing farm animals, hand-built dry stone walls, and…cheese? Well, if you're a fan of the beloved British claymation series 'Wallace & Gromit,' you may have first heard of this area of the Dales, Wensleydale, because of its local cheese. In fact, the animated duo's notorious affinity for the local curd—which Wallace likes because producers thought saying it makes his face look 'nice and toothy'—became so widespread that it helped the Wensleydale cheesemakers stave off bankruptcy.\nCheese aside, another staple of Wensleydale, and the surrounding Yorkshire Dales National Park, are the 5,000 miles of dry stone walls that have crisscrossed the landscape for centuries. The walls were built by farmers to delineate boundaries, clarify land ownership, and more practically, to keep their cows and sheep from wandering off. The walls are considered 'dry' because they were built with no mortar to bind the stones together. Larger stones form a base for the wall, upon which smaller stones are stacked to create two parallel wall faces, constructed simultaneously. More stones are then used to fill in the gap between the two wall faces, with gravity doing the rest. While that may sound flimsy, a well-constructed dry stone wall can last at least 100 years.",

But what you're really looking at is rugged tidal marshland, visible when the tide is out—the rest of the time, much of this area is underwater. Mockhorn is itself part of Virginia's coastal island chain called the Barrier Islands, which run down the east coast of the state from the Maryland-Delaware border for about 70 miles, stretching to the mouth of Chesapeake Bay. The green vegetation you see is grass, although not the kind you'll find in a suburban lawn. Instead, it's saltmarsh cordgrass, a type of perennial deciduous species that grows in wetlands and salt marshes like this one.\nThe only way to access the tidal channels of Mockhorn Island is by boat, and plenty of kayakers, hunters, and sport fishers are willing to brave the fickle, windy weather to enjoy the island's labyrinth of sloughs, bays, and inlets. The area's also a great destination for bird watchers, as many bird species fly directly overhead while migrating. Historically, the rugged terrain and remote location of the Barrier Islands made them a great place for those running from the authorities—it's said that pirates, including Blackbeard himself, spent time in hiding in the backwaters of this rugged coast.",

Anyway, World Laughter Day is celebrated on the first Sunday of May to remind people of the very real physical and mental health benefits of laughter. It's no joke that laughter has a clinically proven positive effect on your well-being. And experts (yes, there are experts) agree that laughing lowers blood pressure, releases endorphins, works your abs, reduces stress hormones, and even boosts T cells that fight infection. Faking it still works, even if you're not feeling it.\nThe Burchell's zebra is named for William John Burchell, an English naturalist and explorer who in the early 1800s traveled extensively in South Africa, where he studied these and many other animals. The Burchell's zebra is distinguished by one or two faint stripes on its haunches that appear to shadow the bold stripes, but otherwise it strongly resembles other plains zebras. The social structure of Burchell's zebras is based on a stallion leading a herd of mares—the whole group is called a harem. A young stallion may attempt to lead one of the mares away to his own harem, an effort that may result in a rough confrontation with the resident stallion.",

		"description": "To celebrate American Wetlands Month, we're flying over Norcross Brook, which snakes through the wetlands of Maine's North Woods near Moosehead Lake. Wetlands like these are an often underappreciated natural resource. They act as vital links between the land and our planet's watersheds, playing a crucial role in protecting healthy ecosystems. In addition to providing indispensable habitat for the many species that call them home, wetlands filter our drinking water and cycle nutrients. They also provide a natural buffer from storms, absorb flood waters, and capture carbon from the atmosphere—all of which help to mitigate the impact of climate change.\nSome of the wetlands here around Moosehead Lake include the West Shirley Bog and the Lazy Tom Bog, both of which are well-known moose-watching hot spots. The hulking animals of Maine's North Woods are so common they're said to outnumber residents 3 to 1. Surely there's a moose or five down there among those trees…",

		"description": "For World Migratory Bird Day, we're looking at a flock of black-tailed godwits in the Netherlands. These shorebirds breed in parts of Europe and Russia, and then migrate to areas in Western Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia. A large percentage of the godwit population breeds in the Netherlands, which is why the country voted to make it the national bird in 2015. It's also captured in paintings by Dutch artists Vermeer and Rembrandt, making the black-tailed godwit as 'Dutch as they come,' according to the Dutch newspaper Trouw.\nWorld Migratory Bird Day highlights the need to protect habitat for winged travelers like these. It began as International Migratory Bird Day in 1993 and was run by different organizations before moving in 2007 to the Environment for the Americas, a non-profit that encourages bird conservation through education and research. World Migratory Bird Day is observed on the second Saturday in May and the second Saturday in October, though the group notes that different species of birds migrate at different times and encourages organizations to host local events when migratory birds are present.",

		"description": "To celebrate Mother's Day, we're in California's Monterey Bay, where a sea otter mom gives her 3-day-old pup a place to snuggle and gives us an amazingly cute picture to boot. These incredibly photogenic animal moms shower their kids with attention, cradling them and grooming them for hours. But all that love is more than a gesture of affection, as newborn sea otter pups can't swim. A pup is totally dependent for about six months, so mom will carry it around on her stomach like you see here. When the little one does venture into the water on its own, mom will rub the pup to fluff its coat, which causes the fur to retain air bubbles, insulating it from chilly water and causing the youngster to float like a cork.\nAnd that fur is remarkable—it's considered the thickest of any mammal on Earth at up to 1 million hairs per square inch. After about four weeks, sea otter pups will start swimming and eating on their own—at six weeks they'll start diving by themselves, too. Until then, mom keeps her pup close. When she does have to leave the pup in search of food, she'll sometimes wrap the little one in kelp, which keeps it from floating away while she looks for dinner.",

It looks like a sailboat at sunset, accompanied by a group of rowers. But this is actually the Hōkūle'a, a replica of a traditional Polynesian voyaging canoe, as it departs in May 2014 for a three-year 'Mālama Honua' voyage to circumnavigate the world. The Polynesian Voyaging Society, which organizes the expeditions of the Hōkūle'a, explains that 'Mālama Honua' means to 'care for our Island Earth.' As they sail around the world, they're discovering and sharing local and Indigenous wisdom in a bid to help overcome the world's current challenges.\nThe Hōkūle'a is probably best known for its 1976 maiden voyage, when it sailed from Hawaii to Tahiti without the use of charts or instruments. Instead, the crew used traditional Polynesian voyaging techniques such as star mapping and tracking cloud formations, wave patterns, and the flights of birds. Why go to so much trouble? The sailors wanted to prove that their ancestors discovered Hawaii during purposeful trips in the Pacific, instead of happening on the islands by chance while aimlessly drifting with the currents. The Hōkūle'a continues to sail today, spreading the culture of Hawaiians and other Polynesians—doing the work and sharing the wisdom of Mālama Honua.",

But the city of Limerick has embraced its namesake poetry style and in recent years the Limerick Writers' Centre has hosted an annual competition called Bring Your Limericks to Limerick.\nWe're looking across the River Shannon at the historic part of the city, a medieval section walled off by the Vikings around 812 and known today as King's Island. That's King John's Castle on the left, built on the order of King John in 1200. Over on the right is St. Mary's Cathedral, which dates from 1168 and is the oldest building in Limerick still in use. History suggests the area was settled long before the Vikings conquered it and set about destroying Irish public records. The earliest map of Ireland, produced in 150 CE by historian and overall polymath Ptolemy, shows a place called 'Regia' at the same site as King's Island.",

To begin to grasp its immensity, consider these numbers: The Amazon rainforest covers about 2% of the world's surface area, nearly 2.1 million square miles across South America, mostly (nearly 60%) in the country you see here, Brazil. It's an area that accounts for over half the Earth's remaining rainforests. The breadth of biodiversity is incomparable—nearly 16,000 different tree species, 40,000 species of other plants, 2.5 million insect species, and over 2,000 different types of birds and mammals. Incredibly, perhaps a tenth of the planet's known species call the Amazon home, many of which have not even been identified.\nYet, despite its vastness and ecological riches, the Amazon and the world's rainforests in general are in jeopardy, with large swaths of these precious environments being stripped and spoiled every day. Recent analysis has revealed some ominous warning signs that the Amazon rainforest, long known as the 'Lungs of the World,' is now spewing out as much greenhouse gas as it can store because of rampant deforestation here. If true, this is a bad sign in our battle against climate change. Hopefully, these warnings will raise awareness about the importance of rainforests, and the vital 'carbon sink' role they play in creating and maintaining the air we breathe. The more we learn about rainforests, the more we appreciate how our own future, and the future of our planet, hinges upon their health.",

The dazzling colors indicate temperature, from chilly red (5,000-ish degrees Fahrenheit) to balmy blue (temps in the tens of thousands).\nWhat about those structures beneath the starry sky? They're three of the eight telescopes making up the Very Large Telescope, an aptly named project of the European Southern Observatory.

This huge rock is found in northwest Colombia, a region once inhabited by the Indigenous Tahamí people, who are said to have worshipped El Peñón, as many locals now call it. Probably because it's so smooth, no one is known to have climbed the rock until 1954, when a small group of friends scaled it by wedging a series of boards into a vertical crack. It took them five days to reach the top.\nThese days El Peñón is considerably easier to climb, but it'll still make you work for that view at the top. Built into the same crack the climbers used back in '54, a masonry staircase now makes several switchbacks all the way to the summit. Each of the 740 stairs is numbered, so you can be reminded with each step just how many more remain before you arrive at the viewing platform up top.

Once seen throughout midwestern North America, whooping cranes were driven perilously close to extinction by the early 1940s, with fewer than two dozen birds in the wild. Thanks to conservation efforts, their numbers have now risen to more than 600. While that's good news, this limited recovery is still fragile, and these incredible creatures remain imperiled, particularly by the loss of their wetland habitat.\nWhooping cranes are so named because of their unique and very loud call, which they sound either alone or in unison. The calls are so loud they can be heard at distances greater than a mile. Part of the reason the whooping crane is so loud is its trachea, which can be almost 5 feet long, curling into the bird's sternum to help it project.",

On the day the library opened to the public, 30,000 to 50,000 people streamed through its doors to take in the architecture and gaze at the one million books on display. The first book request was filed at 9:08 AM and delivered to the reader six minutes later through the library's rapid delivery system. Since then, it's become part of the very fabric of New York and has been featured in movies from 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' to 'Ghostbusters' to 'Spiderman.'\nToday, we turn our gaze to the beaux-arts delight that is the Main Branch's Rose Main Reading Room. It is truly one of New York's great public spaces, a lavish hall where one can come to escape the bustle of the city streets and the honking of taxis.

So, in his fictional universe, Adams invented the Infinite Improbability Drive as a way to cross its vast distances in a nothingth of a second. And, in one memorable passage, to convert two approaching nuclear missiles into a bowl of petunias and a sperm whale. Thus, today's image of the Earth's largest toothed whale is our tribute to Adams on the 20th annual celebration of Towel Day (it's surprisingly difficult to find a really great image of a bowl of petunias).\nWhy's it called Towel Day? For the uninitiated, 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy' recommends having a towel with you at all times as it 'is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitchhiker can have.' The novel lists many reasons, from the practical to the psychological, but having one with you today would be a fitting tribute to the late author, no matter what your travel plans.

It's been attracting visitors for nearly 1,800 years and remains one of the most popular attractions in all of China. Located in Sichuan province, this temple complex was constructed to honor two principal members of the Shu Han state (221-263) of China's early Three Kingdoms period. And although the founder of Shu Han, Liu Bei, is honored with his own temple and shrine here, the real headliner is one of China's most important historical figures, Zhuge Liang, who is remembered as a great wit, scholar, astronomer, statesman, and military strategist. In fact, the name Wuhou itself derives from the Chinese title 'Marquis of Wu,' which was an honorary title given to Zhuge Liang.\nThe Wuhou Temple complex is about 9 acres in size, and is graced by winding, peaceful paths lined by trees. It contains not only the temples devoted to Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang, but also a famous garden, a mausoleum, and important cultural relics like the Tablet of Triple Success.",

Protecting some of the most magnificent mountain landscapes of the Julian Alps, Triglav is the country's only national park, but it's a stunner. Running along Slovenia's northwestern border with Italy, Triglav was first protected as a 'conservation park' in 1924, then made a national park in 1981. The park gets its name from the mountain at its heart, Triglav, long considered a symbol of Slovenia and of Slovene identity.\nSince 2018, the UN General Assembly has recognized June 3 as World Bicycle Day to honor 'the uniqueness, longevity and versatility of the bicycle, which has been in use for two centuries.' The bicycle has gone through many iterations since Karl Drais created the brakeless, pedalless bike forerunner called a 'vélocipède' in 1817. The German inventor would likely be floored by today's variety of bike options, from new lightweight road bikes to heavier mountain bikes with fat, knobby tires designed to handle rougher terrain. More than 200 years after Drais introduced his two-wheeled contraption, bicycles remain as popular as ever. Chances are there's one just waiting for you to take it for a spin, and what better day to do so than World Bicycle Day?",

The atoll was formed as a shield volcano roughly 28 million years ago. Over the millennia, the volcanic island subsided under the sea but the coral reef encircling it has maintained itself and protected the atoll's three, low-lying islands (Sand Island, not shown in our photo, is the third).\nStill etched onto the surface of Eastern Island are some of the airstrips that made Midway the United States' most strategic toehold in the central Pacific in the early days of World War II. Over June 4-7, 1942, the Battle of Midway was fought here—and in the surrounding waters—between the US and Imperial Japanese navies. Regarded by military historians as one of the most consequential naval battles ever, it involved hundreds of aircraft, seven aircraft carriers, two battleships, and over 80 cruisers, destroyers, and submarines. When it was over, the US had sunk all four of the Japanese fleet aircraft carriers, a heavy cruiser, nearly 250 Japanese planes, and turned the tide of the war in the Pacific. Today the atoll is encompassed by the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument, a 583,000-square-mile protected zone that supports over 7,000 species of plants and animals.",

Their story began 77 years ago today, on D-Day, when the first of the Allied troops touched down on the Nazi-occupied beaches at Normandy. After the Allies successfully held the beachheads, the Mulberries were towed into place so the artificial harbors could provide the port facilities necessary to offload the thousands of men and vehicles, and tons of supplies necessary to sustain the effort to drive the Germans out of France.\nTwo Mulberry harbours were built for D-Day. The one known as Mulberry A was constructed off Omaha Beach to aid US forces. Mulberry B was built here, off Gold Beach at Arromanches, to supply British and Canadian troops. Mulberry A was destroyed in a storm just a few days after it was built, but Mulberry B was operational for 10 months after the landings, providing crucial infrastructure to the Allied operation. The innovative feat of military engineering enabled the largest seaborne invasion in history, which in turn laid the foundations of the Allied victory on the Western Front.",

This Mexican marine park in the Sea of Cortez is home to the northernmost and oldest coral reef on the west coast of North America, estimated to be about 20,000 years old. Jacks are clearly plentiful here, but divers and snorkelers in Cabo Pulmo can also come across many other species of fish and marine mammals, including several varieties of sharks, whales, dolphins, tortoises, and manta rays.\nFor this year's World Oceans Day, the UN chose the theme 'The Ocean: Life & Livelihoods,' to raise awareness of the nearly 3 billion people worldwide who depend on oceans for their food and way of life. The residents of Cabo Pulmo know a little about this—to help revitalize their previously unprotected and overfished waters, the Mexican government made Cabo Pulmo a national park in 1995. But more controversially, officials also banned fishing, a big deal in an area where many people lived off the food they caught by hand. The preservation efforts paid off, though—researchers say the park experienced a 460% increase in the number of fish living in park waters between 1999 and 2009, turning Cabo Pulmo into one of the world's most robust marine reserves. Now, many residents who once relied on fishing have been able to move into jobs in ecotourism or other vocations supporting the park.",

The thick walls that surround the fortress are shaped in a star pattern, with pentagonal bastions jutting out from the curtain wall at the corners. We're looking at one of those bastions coming to a point in the lower center of our image.\nA stone's throw from the Spanish border, the Nossa Senhora da Graça Fort was built to defend the garrison border town of Elvas. It's a region shaped by war. The Spanish laid siege to the area during the Portuguese Restoration War (1640-1668), but after the Nossa Senhora da Graça Fort was built a century later, the town was never defeated again. With its 144 cannons, the fort resisted an attack by another wave of Spanish forces during the 1801 War of the Oranges and 10 years later drove back an invading French army during the Peninsular War.\nEventually the fort became a political prison, which it remained until 1974, when it was abandoned and fell into ruin. But it was restored after 2012, when UNESCO recognized the entire historical center of Elvas—including the Nossa Senhora da Graça Fort, a few other nearby forts, and the 16th-century Amoreira Aqueduct—as a World Heritage Site.",

A glen is a long, narrow valley and this one is especially beautiful. It has strange footnotes in both Irish and Scottish folklore. The name itself translates to 'little fierce one' and was given in honor of Etive, the Gaelic goddess long associated with Loch Etive.\nAccording to an Irish myth, the tragic heroine Deirdre and her lover, Naoise, sought refuge in Glen Etive after they were forced into exile. In Scottish folklore, Glen Etive is said to be the home of a mythical creature called a fachan—a giant cyclops with one leg, a single tuft of hair, and a lone hand protruding from its chest. Glen Etive has caught the attention of modern storytellers drawn to its history and beautiful scenery as well. A surprising number of TV shows and major films, like 'Braveheart' and the James Bond installment 'Skyfall,' have shot on location here.\nGlen Etive is also part of one of Scotland's 40 National Scenic Areas, and is a favorite destination for white water kayakers, who journey here to shoot down the series of rapids, falls, and pool drops along the River Etive. Hikers trek the mountain trails around Ben Starav to the southeast and the Glen Coe mountains in the north. Some of these hikers are known as 'peak baggers,' who make it a game to summit every peak in the region that’s 3,000 feet or higher. So far, more than 6,000 or so people have completed the entire list of 282 Scottish peaks, or 'munros' as they're known locally.",

The date marks the occasion in 1777 when the Stars and Stripes were adopted as our nation's ultimate symbol. While the design of the US flag has undergone several changes since then, it's been mostly stable since 1818, when Congress settled on the 13 white and red stripes, plus a star for every state.

Surrounded by snow-capped mountains just out of frame, Lucerne lies in the German-speaking part of central Switzerland and is divided into two parts linked by a series of bridges. The most famous of these bridges—the centerpiece and symbol of Lucerne—is the Kapellbrücke (Chapel Bridge), a covered wooden footbridge that you can see spanning diagonally across the Reuss in our photo. The building rising from the river alongside the footbridge is a medieval water tower, which has been used as a prison, torture chamber, local archive, and treasury.\nOriginally built in the 1300s as part of Lucerne's fortifications, Chapel Bridge connected the old town on the right bank of the Reuss to the new town on the left, securing the city from attack via Lake Lucerne to the south. It is believed to be the oldest covered wooden bridge in Europe, as well as the world's oldest surviving truss bridge, although much of it had to be replaced after a devastating fire in 1993. Named for the nearby St. Peter's Chapel—the oldest original church structure in Lucerne—Chapel Bridge is picturesque in more ways than one: People crossing the river can view paintings on triangular panels under the bridge's roof that date back to the 17th century. Painted by local artist Hans Heinrich Wägmann, they depict Lucerne's patron saints, and events in Swiss national history. Of the original set of 158, 62 paintings survived the fire.",

Fijians, Tahitians, Hawaiians, and other Pacific Islanders have been riding waves for several hundred years at least. But the sport didn’t really catch on in the rest of the world until the early 1900s, when Hawaiian Olympic swimmer Duke Kahanamoku demonstrated surfing to both US and Australian officials, creating a wave of popularity that has yet to break.",

		"description": "These bald eagles look like they're enjoying some family time on Father's Day. But today is extra special for them, because it's also American Eagle Day, a celebration that commemorates the date in 1782 when the bird was added to the Great Seal of the United States, effectively becoming a national symbol. With an olive branch in its right talons and a bundle of 13 arrows in its left (representing the 13 original states in the Union), the eagle is said to represent a strong desire for peace, but readiness for conflict. You'll recognize the Great Seal of the United States from its appearance on passports, flags, official documents, and American currency.\nBald eagles were once plentiful in North America, but by the 1950s their population had plummeted to around 400 nesting pairs. Their decline was attributed to several factors, including use of the pesticide DDT, which caused thinning in their eggshells and interfered with reproduction. New regulations, including a ban on DDT, helped the species rebound. Today, bald eagles can be found in all US states except Hawaii.\nFather's Day was first celebrated in 1910 in Washington state. While it gained popularity over the years, it didn't become a national holiday until President Richard Nixon signed a bill in 1972. Mother's Day got a presidential proclamation in 1914, but let's not get competitive here—today's about dad.",

This time of year, the sun never seems to set here, delivering up to 21 full hours of sunlight and three hours of twilight. Iceland experiences the long days of midnight sun between mid-May and mid-August.

But don't worry: Even though it may inspire a bit of vertigo and has been known to sway a bit with the wind, the platform is perfectly safe—the glass floor is reinforced by titanium alloys. Once out on the platform, viewers can look down through glass into the rugged sandstone rocks and forest of the Shilinxia gorge below.

'NYC Pride events offer an opportunity to gather in community and highlight the diversity, resilience, and power of the LGBTQI+ community, giving us the energy and spirit we need to continue the fight,' Thomas continued. That resilience is evident in the event itself, which pivoted to an all-virtual program last year in the midst of the pandemic, but which integrates in-person and virtual experiences in 2021, including today's NYC Pride March.

Gozo is the second-largest island in the Maltese archipelago (after the island of Malta itself), and despite all appearances it's the less densely populated of the two.\nOn both Gozo and Malta, today marks the start of a two-day celebration of Maltese culture called Mnarja (sometimes spelled Imnarja). The national festival dates from the 16th century and is dedicated to the feast day of Saints Peter and Paul on June 29. During Mnarja, centuries-old Maltese customs and traditions are on full display. The streets come alive with traditional folk songs called ghana, as well as dancing, and horse and donkey races, some of which feature jockeys riding behind in chariots. Malta's national dish, a rabbit stew called fenkata, is served at nearly all Mnarja events. During the festival's medieval origins this was the only time of year when ordinary Maltese people were allowed to eat rabbit, which was usually reserved for the knights that then ruled the islands. To wash down the rabbit stew? Maltese wine, of course. Saħħa! ('Cheers!')",

The gorgeous beach you see here is Anse Source d'Argent on the island of La Digue, one of 115 islands that make up this tropical republic. Anse Source d'Argent has long been a favorite of photographers, who are drawn to its contoured, dark granite boulders, pristine white sand, and turquoise-colored water. Beachcombers and sun worshippers also flock to the Seychelles because of their consistently great weather—daily high temperatures almost always stay within a comfortable range of between 75 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit all year round.\nMost any day is a day worth celebrating here, but today is cause for double celebration: June 29 is Independence Day in Seychelles, commemorating the nation's 1976 independence from centuries of colonial rule under the French and British. It also happens to be the UN's International Day of the Tropics, a day of special recognition for Seychelles and other locales within the zone between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn. That accounts for about 36% of Earth's land mass and close to 40% of its population. The intent of International Day of the Tropics is twofold: as a celebration of the extraordinary diversity of this zone while also highlighting the challenges facing the region, like poverty, climate change, deforestation, urbanization, and demographic shifts.",

That's right, don't worry: People somewhere are coming up with plans for this.\nGood thing, because as our photo shows, asteroid impacts do happen. Manicouagan Crater, aka the 'eye of Québec,' was formed by a 3-mile-wide meteorite that hit Earth about 215 million years ago. Much more recently, an explosive meteorite leveled 800 square miles of Siberian forest in what's called the Tunguska event. It was 113 years ago today, and Asteroid Day's date was chosen in recognition.\nSo if you find yourself casting paranoid glances at the sky today, maybe do a little searching on how scientists are learning to prevent potential impacts. Proposed plans involve everything from altering an asteroid's course via a gravitational field, to delaying its approach by attaching rocket thrusters, to good old-fashioned blowing it up.

Other wildlife routinely spotted in Monfragüe include otters, deer, wild boar, and Iberian lynx.\nWhen the sun goes down in Monfragüe, the generally cloudless sky, combined with the low level of light pollution, makes this a perfect place for stargazing. The national park was recognized as a dark-sky preserve in 2016. Monfragüe also appeals to those interested in the human history of the area, as it contains a number of caves with prehistoric paintings, Roman ruins, and the remnants of the castle of Monfragüe, which was built by Moors in the 9th century.",

		"description": "The Farolim de Felgueiras (Lighthouse of Felgueiras) you see here has withstood relentless waves for around 135 years. It offered its solitary warnings to ships approaching Porto, Portugal's second-largest city, beginning in 1886 until it was finally deactivated in 2009. Even though it's no longer operational, it's still a well-known local landmark. It offers sightseers a beautiful view, and maybe a little ocean spray, from its perch overlooking the mouth of the Douro River where it flows into the Atlantic.\nThe nearby city of Porto was originally established in around 136 BCE by the Romans as an outpost called Portus Cale (Port of Cale), which is believed to be the origin of the name Portugal. The city is also responsible for the name of one of the country's most famous exports, Port wine, the (usually) sweet red fortified wine that was first exported by local merchants across Europe in the second half of the 17th century. These days the city and surrounding municipalities are home to around 1.7 million people, but Porto retains its historic charm. One of its oldest riverside neighborhoods, the Ribeira, was honored as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1996 and was also designated as a National Monument of Portugal.",

		"description": "If this beautiful view of Grand Teton National Park seems as pretty as a painting, there may be a reason for it. The majestic peaks towering over the landscape include Mount Moran, named for Thomas Moran, an American artist of New York's Hudson River School who earned fame by painting scenes of the Western frontier. In 1871, Moran and photographer William Henry Jackson were invited on an expedition to the Yellowstone region to accompany a team from the US Geological Society while they conducted the first comprehensive survey of the area. Moran's paintings and Jackson's photographs from the trip immediately captured the public's attention and inspired Congress to establish Yellowstone as the first national park in 1872.\nFor the next two decades, Moran painted hundreds of landscapes of the Yellowstone region, producing indelible images of this spectacular wilderness that would come to define the American West in the imaginations of many. The area had such an impact on Moran that he adopted the signature T-Y-M, Thomas 'Yellowstone' Moran. He returned to the area in August 1879 on an expedition to the Teton range, just south of Yellowstone National Park. He never made it as far into the mountains as he'd hoped, but gazing up at the towering peaks, he wrote in his diary, 'From this point it is perhaps the finest pictorial range in the United States or even N. America.' Judging from this image, it's hard to argue with him.",

Shark Awareness Day is meant to highlight the importance of the most fearsome fish in nature, from little dwarf lantern sharks to great whites to these blacktip reef sharks cruising the Tahitian coast.\nWhy celebrate an apex predator that most humans associate with horror movies? Well, first: The blacktip reef shark is timid around people and has not been known to fatally attack a human. And second: Without sharks acting as population control on other marine life, the ocean would be a very different place. Sharks eat a lot of squid and smaller fish—like land predators, they help keep their prey from overpopulating. Shark populations have declined more than 70% since the 1970s, so they deserve our attention as a vital, disappearing part of the marine ecosystem—even if they seem a little scary.",

Most scholars believe it was known to Arab seafarers by the 10th century, but it remained uninhabited until Portuguese sailors established a base on the island in the early 1500s. Mauritius was later colonized in succession by the Netherlands, France, and Great Britain before gaining independence in 1968.

The 21st and final stage of this year's Tour de France—the 108th edition of the famous event—begins in Chatou, a town in the western suburbs of Paris along the River Seine. Tour tradition dictates the overall race leader isn't challenged on the last day, so it starts out as a victory parade for the champion-elect, who will be wearing a yellow jersey, posing for pictures, and sipping a glass of champagne along the route. But when the riders reach the heart of Paris, the pace picks up as they dash along the Champs-Élysées, a tree-lined promenade often described as the 'most beautiful avenue in the world.'\nThe peloton—a large group of riders bunched together—enters the Champs-Élysées via the courtyards of the Louvre Palace, passing directly by its famous glass pyramid, as shown on our homepage. They then complete an eight-lap circuit, which takes them on a sightseeing tour around the Arc de Triomphe, past the Tuileries Garden, across the Place de la Concorde—the largest square in Paris—and back up the cobblestones of the Champs-Élysées, which is French for 'Elysian Fields,' the final resting place for heroes from Greek mythology. Quite the place then to finish a relentless race that covers more than 2,000 miles and includes brutal climbs in the Alps and the Pyrenees. Chapeau!",

The medina later became a refuge for Muslims and Sephardic Jews from Andalusia who were fleeing the Reconquista and the Spanish Inquisition. These refugees helped rebuild the city that had been destroyed by Castilians, making a significant mark on Tétouan's architecture, art, and cuisine. The medina remains largely unchanged all these centuries later, making it a natural fit as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.",

Eight stone walls stretch between eight octagonal towers and enclose an octagonal courtyard. Each of the two floors also has eight trapezoidal rooms. Acclaimed and protected as a World Heritage Site in 1996, the castle symbolically reflects a harmonious integration of classical Roman, Arabic, and medieval architecture and design—and to some, its octagonal symmetry suggests a connection between heaven and earth.\nIts original purpose is unclear. Without a drawbridge, moat, or curtain wall to protect it, it was clearly not a defensive fortress, and its lack of stables calls into question its function as a hunting lodge. Over the centuries it has served as a prison and as a refuge from the plague. But whatever the emperor's intention, he left a captivating monument that still enchants today.",

		"description": "In honor of Cousins Day, we're hanging out on a limb with these four Javan tree frogs in Indonesia. Tree frogs are smaller than your average terrestrial frogs because they spend the majority of their lives perched in trees, and their weight must be fully supported by twigs and leaves. At the rounded ends of their froggy fingers and toes are disc-shaped adhesive pads that help them to maneuver about on trees. While most tree frogs (there are 800 species all over the world!) are green, brown, or gray, these Javans are bright and colorful. This is so they can blend into their jungle environs and avoid notice by predators such as snakes, spiders, bats, and owls.\nEach of these frogs went through a complete metamorphosis, starting out as one of about 50 eggs in a clutch nestled in foam. Tree frog mothers tend to lay their eggs on the leaves of branches hanging over streams, ponds, or lakes. When the eggs hatch, the tadpoles then drop into the water below. The tadpoles mature into frogs and end up hanging out with their frog cousins on limbs like this one. Here's to cousins!",

Walakiri Beach is gently sloped, so it's easy for a visitor to walk out into the knee-deep water to examine the extraordinary transitional zone of a mangrove ecosystem. Mangroves thrive here at the boundary between land and sea, growing in coastal salt water and low-oxygen conditions where other trees would quickly die. Their complex root systems filter out the salt and form a strong natural defense against storm surges, rising sea levels, and coastal erosion. Mangroves also create aquatic nursery habitats that support a highly diverse range of juvenile fish and crustaceans.\nBut despite their critical role in maintaining healthy oceans and coastlines, mangroves are disappearing fast, several times faster than forests on land. The United Nations estimates that the world has lost half its mangrove coverage in just the last 40 years. To raise awareness of the importance of mangrove ecosystems and to promote solutions for their sustainable management and conservation, the UN has declared that July 26 is International Day for the Conservation of the Mangrove Ecosystem.

Today, the World Wildlife Fund estimates there are fewer than 4,000 tigers remaining outside captivity. While the numbers have stabilized a bit recently, these solitary animals continue to be gravely endangered. India is home to the largest number of wild tigers in the world. The massive cats have always played an important cultural role here, and perhaps because of that, the Indian government has set up over 50 tiger reserves across the country, with several more in the works. Despite these efforts and others like them elsewhere, the mighty cat still faces a variety of dangers, including an uptick in poaching, often fueled by illegal trade for tiger parts used in traditional medicines.",

Also known as Loaf Mass Day, it's an observance that marks the beginning of the harvest season and is traditionally celebrated on August 1. The holiday is descended from the ancient British tradition known during the Middle Ages as the Gule of August and was gradually incorporated into the Christian liturgy celebrating Holy Communion. It gets its name from loaves of bread baked from the first harvested grain of the season each year.\nTraditionally, Lammastide festivals would mean up to 10 days of raucous eating, drinking, and general merriment. Scottish couples could also take advantage of another common practice during a Lammas fair: a trial marriage, or 'handfast,' where a young couple could live together for a period that could last as long as the Lammas festival itself, or even up to a full year. If at the end of the trial the couple decided to call things off, the woman could return to her family with all of her possessions. If a child was born from this union, it would go live with the father without stigma. And while this arrangement seems awfully modern, it was likely just a consequence of a lack of priests—handfasts allowed a single traveling priest to perform all the town's weddings in one day.",

It's the most famous of a trio of medieval hilltop castles collectively referred to as 'Drei Gleichen' (Three of a Kind) because of their close resemblance. Wachsenburg was originally built by the Hersfeld Monastery sometime in the early 10th century as a fortified castle, but it underwent significant changes over the centuries.\nAs might be expected of a building nearly 1,100 years old, the castle has housed many different occupants in its time, some of them notorious. Through most of its history it was used as a defensive fortress, and by the 13th century the Counts of Mühlburg had added a moat to help fend off invaders from nearby Hungary. Later, in the mid-15th century, an infamous brigand and wayward knight named Apel von Vitzthum conquered Wachsenburg. He used it as a base to carry out raids against merchants in the nearby town of Erfurt before the locals finally banded together to put an end to his pillaging. The Duke of Saxony took control of the fortress in 1710, but by the late 18th century, it was being used as prison. These days, Wachsenburg plays a different role in the local community. Following a number of renovations, including a major one in the 1990s, it's now a tourist destination complete with restaurant, hotel, and museum.",

		"description": "With short, limber legs and a long tail, the clouded leopard is perfectly adapted for living in the trees. Flexible ankle joints allow it to descend trunks headfirst, one of only two cat species that can pull this off. A long tail provides stabilizing balance for leaps between trees. Sharp, retractable claws let this jungle climber dangle off branches in all sorts of gravity-defying positions.\nClouded leopards are stealthy, solitary creatures native to the tropical jungles of Southeast Asia. Considered a vulnerable species, there are thought to be only about 10,000 adults left in the wild, but firm numbers are hard to come by. No wonder—these cats are so elusive, so rarely seen in the wild, what we know about their behavior has been largely gleaned from studying them in captivity. But protecting the clouded leopard begins with learning about them, which is the aim of International Clouded Leopard Day, observed on August 4, so this is the optimal time to learn about these mysterious cats.",

Hike up here to take in views of Edinburgh and its famous landmarks, including Edinburgh Castle, the Scottish Parliament, Holyrood Palace, the City Centre, and the New Town, which stretches out toward the sea.\nFormed by glaciers and volcanic activity millions of years ago, these craggy outcroppings are among the best examples of a geological sill in Europe. We're lucky that they're still here for our hiking pleasure. For two centuries, the hard dolerite was mined, broken up, and shipped off throughout the UK for use as cobblestone streets.

But what we're looking at isn't snow and ice—it's a surreal landscape of endless salt high in the Andes of southwest Bolivia. Located at a lofty altitude of about 12,000 feet above sea level, Salar de Uyuni is the world's largest salt flat (or salt pan), spanning just over 4,000 square miles. It was formed when prehistoric lakes dried up over centuries, leaving behind a desert of bright white salt that can be seen from space. During the rainy season (December to April), a thin layer of water covering the salt transforms the area into a giant mirror that reflects the beautiful Bolivian skies. If you're driving across the surface at such times, it can appear as though you are navigating through a highway of clouds.\nSalar de Uyuni contains more than just a pinch of salt; there's an estimated 11 billion tons of it here, with about 25,000 tons extracted annually. Local salt gatherers—'saleros'—scoop the raw mineral into mounds to let it dry under the sun before it's transported to the nearby village of Colchani, where it's processed and turned into table salt, which is then sold in Bolivia and other countries. But the real treasure is buried beneath the salt crust: Just below the crystalline surface lies the world's largest untapped lithium reserve, which could one day power the batteries in our smartphones, laptops, and electric cars.",

The architects designed the bridge to dramatically link the Swan River with the city. The upper left and bottom right curves seen in this image are actually double arches that loop up and then under a 360-foot pedestrian and bicycle pathway. The pathway offers striking views of Perth's central business district and connects the area with the newly developed Elizabeth Quay mixed-use development, featuring shops, cafés, apartments, and bars.

This artwork is part of a larger collection of carvings on the edge of Lake Taupo and has become a big tourist attraction despite being accessible only by boat. Four years in the making, the work is a tribute to Māori ancestors and guardians, and the integral roles they play in the Indigenous Māori culture.\nInternational Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples was created by the United Nations to draw attention to the distinct cultures of Indigenous peoples and to support measures that protect their rights. This year's theme is 'Leaving no one behind: Indigenous peoples and the call for a new social contract.' With this focus, the UN hopes to raise awareness about the unwritten rules, or 'social contracts,' that help communities function equitably. Historically, Indigenous peoples have been excluded from these social contracts, which were often meant only for dominant populations. This year's festivities hope to address that inequity and will include a virtual commemoration for guests to discuss how communities can redesign these contracts to be inclusive of the Indigenous and their ways of life.",

Today, on our 175th anniversary, the Smithsonian is the world's largest museum, education, and research complex. And in the decades that I have worked here—as an educator, curator, museum director, and now as Secretary—I have watched us grow into a vital and vibrant 21st-century institution: conducting groundbreaking research, becoming a national leader in K-12 education, creating new museums that represent the American experience more fully, and equipping our audiences to tackle the world's most pressing challenges.\nThe Arts and Industries Building (AIB), pictured here, exemplifies our role as both a cultural steward and a hub of innovation. The Smithsonian's second-oldest building, AIB opened in 1881 as the US National Museum. An architectural icon located at the heart of the National Mall, its soaring halls introduced millions of Americans to wonders about to change the world—Edison's lightbulb, the first telephone, Apollo rockets. Since the 19th century, when it hosted early flight experiments and the country's burgeoning natural history collections, AIB has been a place for creativity and invention.\nThis forward-looking spirit is embodied in FUTURES, the Arts and Industries Building's large-scale, dynamic exhibition opening in November 2021. Focusing on interactive discovery and collaboration, the exhibition will feature art installations, technology debuts, interactive experiences, and ideas that preview humanity's next chapter.

This year, the light show will peak in the predawn hours of August 12. Like most predictable meteor showers, it occurs when Earth's orbit intersects with the long elliptical path of one of the millions of comets that orbit the sun (in this case, Comet Swift-Tuttle). It's called the Perseid meteor shower because the bulk of the meteors appear to originate out of the constellation Perseus.",

(Though to be fair, it's never been observed which claw these crabs use for writing or playing golf.)\nAmong humans, lefties are outnumbered 9 to 1—so simple actions, from typing on keyboards to swiping on dating apps to zipping up a jacket to reaching for the toilet paper, are by design just a little harder for them. International Left-Handers Day is observed each August 13 to highlight this imbalance and work toward lefty-inclusive solutions. Call it a lefty rights movement.\nIf you're a righty, try going through today as if your left hand were dominant—you'll find it's not just lack of practice getting in your way but human design too. And once you've thrown both hands up in frustration, give 10% of your fellow humans a big hand for their everyday resourcefulness.",

The magma quickly turned the water to steam, and like a defective subterranean pressure cooker, the Earth's crust blew its top in a ferocious explosion. The hydrovolcanic eruption sent up a mushroom cloud of steam and spewed burnt volcanic cinders for miles. It also left the giant crater seen in this photo and 12 smaller ones spread across the surface.\nThe Ubehebe Crater (pronounced you-bee-HEE-bee) is a half-mile across and more than 700 feet deep. Geologically speaking, Ubehebe and the other craters here are quite young. A 2016 study concluded that the craters were all formed in a relatively brief series of explosions—a period of days or weeks—about 2,100 years ago. Another eruption could happen, but visitors need not worry about the ground below their feet—seismometers in the region will alert geologists in advance of any future volcanic unrest. A trail around the rim of the crater offers views of the colorful layers of stone along the walls. Adventurous hikers can descend to the bottom, but it's a long slog back out again, especially on a sweltering summer day.",

Spreading across 250,000 square miles, it's the largest area of continuous sand in the world, covering most of southeastern Saudi Arabia, with smaller portions in Yemen, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates. One of the driest places on Earth, almost no one lives in the Rub' al Khali, and much of the desert remains unexplored. Some of the dunes tower more than 800 feet, and the depressions in between—called sabkhas—can be so soft that vehicles, camels, and people can easily become stuck.\nThe Rub' al Khali wasn't always so forbiddingly dry. At various times between 2,000 and 6,000 years ago, 'cataclysmic rainfall,' like modern-day monsoons, formed shallow lakes in the spaces between the dunes. Most of these lakes were temporary, but some lasted hundreds of years and supported a variety of plants and animals, even large creatures like hippopotamuses, water buffalo, and long-horned cattle. Rain isn't unheard of today, either. In May 2018, Cyclone Mekunu brought enough rain to once again form lakes in the Rub' al Khali, reportedly the first time that had happened in about 20 years—it was the rare occasion when the 'Empty Quarter' wasn't looking so empty after all.",

Now the colorful display is a local landmark and even caught the attention of Guinness World Records for being the largest surfboard collection.",

Can you see the rectangular hole in the canyon wall near the top of the image? That's Angels Window. Brave hikers can make their way up to the trail above it, but the window itself is best viewed from various points along the North Rim. Far down below is the Colorado River. Beginning about 6 million years ago, it gradually carved downward through countless layers of sedimentary, igneous, and metamorphic rock. The Colorado and its tributary streams continue to deepen and widen the Grand Canyon even today.\nThe first national park, not only in the US but also in the world, was Yellowstone, which was designated as a park in 1872. It was followed by Sequoia, Yosemite, and Mount Rainier. While the Grand Canyon seems like an obvious choice for a national park, land and mining moguls kept it from becoming protected as a park for years. It finally became a national park in 1919, three years after the National Park Service was created on August 25, 1916. Each year on August 25, Founders Day is celebrated in all the national parks, where entrance fees are waived in honor of the occasion.",

		"description": "No, this isn't a still image from a sci-fi space opera. We're offshore of Coffs Harbour, New South Wales, Australia, watching a Glaucus atlanticus, aka 'sea swallow' or 'blue sea dragon,' snack on the poisonous tentacles of a Porpita porpita, aka 'blue button.' At the tips of the blue button's tentacles are stinging cells called nematocysts, but the venom doesn't deter the sea swallow. Instead, once the sea swallow ingests the blue button's poison, it stores the venom in the tips of its own feather-like fingers called papillae. Would-be predators should think twice before biting the sea swallow. The poison concentrated in its papillae can kill a predator in seconds. If you come across either of these creatures washed ashore, don't touch! While the stings aren't deadly to humans, they can cause skin irritation.\nYou can't tell from this picture, but both of these sea creatures are tiny (about an inch long) and get around by floating on ocean currents. They're both also vibrant shades of blue to help camouflage them from predators. Of course, camouflage didn't keep this blue button safe from the sea swallow. Dinner time!",

Known locally as Casa do Penedo (House of the Rock), its prehistoric appearance has drawn comparisons to the Flintstones' dwelling in the fictional town of Bedrock. But the secluded stone structure on our homepage is very much real—it was built as a rural retreat in the Portuguese countryside in the 1970s. The building is sandwiched between four boulders that serve as the foundation, walls, and ceiling of the house, blending in as part of the beautiful natural landscape.\nIt may appear small on the outside, but inside there are two floors, comprising a kitchen, living room, bathroom, and bedrooms—just enough space for a family and their pet dinosaur. Many of the rustic fittings, including furniture, stairs, and handrails, are made of logs. There's no electricity, but there is a stone fireplace and even a small swimming pool carved into a rock on the boulder-strewn property. The quirkiness of the building has attracted plenty of curious visitors over the years, leaving the owners between a rock and a hard place. Due to an influx of tourists, Casa do Penedo can no longer be used as a peaceful getaway and has even been equipped with bulletproof windows and a steel door to fend off vandals. Today it functions as a small museum with relics and photographs from the house's history.",

Catherine the Great is said to have had an affinity for the white marble that came from Ruskeala and urged its use in the construction of many of the beautiful buildings in St. Petersburg during her 18th-century reign as empress. Ruskeala marble eventually ended up in famous landmarks of the city, including St. Isaac's Cathedral, St. Michael's Castle, and the Marble Palace, among others. While the mines finally stopped operations in the 1990s, the park is now a popular day trip for tourists who want to learn more about the history of mining in the region.",

But Sardinians faced myriad logistical issues trying to export the zinc, lead, and other minerals that were in high demand. Miners on the island were using modern techniques to extract more and more ore, but it wasn't until 1924, when engineer Cesare Vecelli designed and built the mining infrastructure along the cliffs in Porto Flavia, that getting ore off the island matched their ability to extract it.\nBefore Vecelli's architectural marvel at Porto Flavia began operating, ore was often hand carried in wicker baskets and loaded by workers onto boats, a process that was slow, expensive, and often dangerous. Vecelli's innovation was a loading system built high in the cliffs that used gravity to lower ore directly onto ships waiting in the harbor below, saving time and cutting costs by up to 70%. Porto Flavia, which Vecelli named after his daughter, wasn't purely an exercise in productivity. The engineer added design flourishes including a concrete tower, as well as an arched doorway and windows, giving the port a certain elegance not normally associated with a mining hub. These days, Porto Flavia lives on as a UNESCO-protected tourist attraction.",

Hummingbirds, such as the Anna's hummingbird in this photo, are crucial to healthy ecosystems. Many flowers have evolved funnel-shaped blooms specifically to attract hummingbirds—large insects like bumblebees can’t always squeeze into these tubular blossoms. But hummingbirds can plunge their long, narrow bills deep into the blooms to find the nectar that accumulates in the base and in the process, they spread pollen from flower to flower.\nThey're also highly adaptable. While many other hummingbirds on the Pacific Coast of North America migrate to warmer areas as fall and winter approach, the Anna's hummingbird can survive the cooler temps by bulking up its fat stores or, if necessary, slowing down its metabolism to cope with the cold.\nIf you don't know the words to the hummingbird national anthem, it's easy: Just hum along.",

Gondoliers are dressed in period costume as they ferry high-ranking Venetian officials up the Grand Canal in a faithful recreation of Venice's storied maritime past. The regatta commemorates the welcome given in 1489 to Caterina Cornaro, the wife of the King of Cyprus, who renounced her throne in favor of Venice.\nAfter the parade, it's time for the racing. Competitions are divided by age categories and feature different types of historical boats. The last and most popular race is the gondolini regatta. A lighter and faster version of the gondola from which it takes its shape, the gondolino is rowed by two competitors—standing as per Venetian tradition—who power their way up the Grand Canal toward the finish line at the famous 'machina,' the spectacular floating stage in front of the Ca' Foscari palace on the city's waterfront.",

Over on the left, and just out of camera shot, is George Washington. Beginning in 1927, sculptor Gutzon Borglum led more than 400 workers to carve these presidential visages into the granite face of Mount Rushmore. These tradespeople were not artists—most of them were miners who had come to the Black Hills looking for gold—but they knew how to use dynamite, jackhammers, and chisels, and so they worked for 14 years carving the likenesses into the stone.\nThis holiday weekend, as you grill, relax, or maybe even work like these rangers and the tradespeople who came before them, it's worth noting the origins of this holiday. Labor Day was established in the late 19th century by trade unionists who wanted a day to honor the social and economic achievements of American workers. However you labor, and however you spend your day, we hope it's a pleasant one.",

Where there are swarms of dive-bombing birds, there will be fish, and where there are fish, there may be humpback whales.\nIt appears this pod of humpbacks is engaged in 'bubble-net feeding,' a phenomenon that involves the whales diving below a school of fish and then blowing bubbles as they twirl back up. The bubbles create a 'net' around the fish, disorienting them and allowing the whales to gobble up mouthfuls as they rise to the surface.\nIt's an ingenious way to catch prey. This is the feeding season after all, and these whales spend up to 20 hours a day eating 1 to 1.5 tons of krill and small fish. As for the seagulls pictured here, they certainly appear happy to take part in the feast. Bon appétit!",

If you spot a red panda in the wild, consider yourself lucky. Not only will you have to travel far (they live in the mountain forests of Nepal, Bhutan, China, Myanmar, and India), but there are fewer than 10,000 wild red pandas, and they're rather elusive, hanging out up in trees. They also spend more than half their day asleep, conserving energy for—you guessed it—eating bamboo leaves. They spend a whopping 13 hours a day eating.",

		"description": "Ahoy matey! Today is International Talk Like a Pirate Day so we present to you a fortress that was really used to defend against pirates. Arrr! This is Le Castella, a magnificent fortification on the Calabrian coast of Italy. For centuries it served as a defense against warring nations and rampaging pirates from the Ottoman Empire.\nLegend holds (and what good pirate story doesn't start that way?) that in 1536, an Algerian pirate nicknamed Redbeard stopped by here on one of his many European raiding sprees and wreaked havoc on this fortress. Gazing upon these rock walls, it's easy to imagine area soldiers at battle with Redbeard and his pirate ships. Can you see the cannons firing? Smell the plumes of smoke? Hear the clink-clink of sword on sword?\nAs for Talk Like a Pirate Day, the idea for such a day was dreamed up in 1995 by a couple of Oregon guys and became an unofficial holiday after writer and humorist Dave Barry helped make it go viral. Now every year on September 19, people all over the world raise their cups of grog and shout, 'Aye, aye!' Well, in our imagination, at least.",

		"description": "In the fall and spring, thousands of people come to the marshlands of the Wadden Sea, between Denmark and Germany, to watch huge flocks of starlings take flight at sunset. The birds synchronize their movements in a flocking behavior called murmuration. They swoop, shift, and turn as one, creating incredible shapes in the sky.\nThe Danes call this phenomenon 'sort sol,' or black sun. And the description's apt. The starling flocks can be so thick they appear to darken the evening skies. Experts believe murmuration is a defense against hawks and other raptors, or it could also be a way for the birds to stay warm as temperatures dip. Whatever the reason for their mesmerizing, undulating movements, one thing is undeniable—the starlings put on a stunning show.",

It's made of more than 7,000 recycled plastic water bottles with LED lights inside, to honor one of China's most important holidays, the Mid-Autumn Festival. While it's only been an 'official' public holiday in China since 2008, mention of the Mid-Autumn Festival first appeared in written historical texts as far back as 3,000 years ago. Families celebrate the holiday by lighting paper lanterns and sharing a meal, traditionally at a round table. This reunion is said to bring good luck and happiness.\nOne of the tastier traditions of this holiday is the eating of mooncakes, which are a type of stuffed pastry served during the festival when the moon is supposedly at its fullest and brightest. These famous cakes can be sweet, stuffed with a sweet bean paste, or savory and stuffed with ham, sausage, or nuts and dried fruit. Mooncakes are often given as gifts to friends, coworkers, and family members, and the holiday is even sometimes called the Mooncake Festival. The Mid-Autumn Festival is not only a Chinese holiday, but is celebrated across Asia, with each nation observing this family-friendly holiday in its own unique way.",

In the wild, these majestic animals are grazers, with wide, square upper lips perfect for feeding on the grasses of African savannahs. The two-horned white rhino is one of five living rhino species, along with the black, greater one-horned, Sumatran, and Javan rhinos. White rhinos, like the mother and offspring you see nuzzling here, have seen their numbers dwindle due to poaching and shrinking natural habitats.\nIt's estimated that there are only between 17,000 to 18,000 white rhinos alive today, and those are still under constant threat from poachers who illegally target the animals for their horns. In fact, rhinos of all species have seen a precipitous drop in population, from a total of around 500,000 at the beginning of the 20th century, to just over 28,000 today. According to the International Rhino Foundation, the theme of this year's World Rhino Day, which also happens to fall on the day of the 2021 autumnal equinox, is 'keep the five alive.'",

		"description": "Official telescopic confirmation of Neptune's presence in our solar system came on September 23, 1846, and it was a big deal partly because Neptune is the only planet in our solar system not visible with the naked eye. Credit for this discovery inspired a dust-up in the international astronomy community, as scientists from both Britain and France claimed they had been the first to predict the existence and position of the eighth and most-distant planet in our solar system before it was seen through a telescope. Eventually peace was brokered, and credit is now shared between the two factions.\nThe discovery of Neptune was a sensational moment of 19th-century science, since the existence and position of Neptune were predicted before the planet was even seen, thus confirming the basic principles of Newtonian gravitational theory. But those 19th-century astronomers were using astronomical coordinates first recorded by Galileo in 1612. The Italian polymath had correctly mapped Neptune's position more than 200 years earlier using a less powerful telescope. Galileo mistook Neptune for a star—but his coordinates prompted many stargazers who came along after him to look in the correct direction and identify Neptune.",

Constructed in the city's busy main square called the Plaza de Armas, this Gothic-Renaissance-styled building took nearly 100 years to complete.

The event branched off in 2005 from its source, BC Rivers Day, which has been observed by British Columbians in Canada since 1980. The annual event is now celebrated on the fourth Sunday of September by millions of people in more than 100 countries. It is a day that raises public awareness about rivers around the world and encourages their conservation.\nOur photo, captured by NASA's Earth-imaging Landsat 8 satellite, shows part of the Mackenzie River Delta and the river's turbid waters as they flow from the continent's far north into the Beaufort Sea in the Arctic Ocean. The Mackenzie is the longest river in Canada and has the second-largest drainage basin of any North American river after the Mississippi. It plays a vital role in modulating the Arctic climate as warmer fresh water mixes with colder seawater.\nAbout 7% of the fresh water that flows into the Arctic Ocean each year comes from the Mackenzie and its delta, and much of that arrives in large pulses after periods of inland ice and snow melts. These pulses, known as freshets, carry huge amounts of sediment—much of it derived from erosion of the Rocky Mountains upstream—which you can see pouring out of the river on today's homepage.",

The city was founded in 206 BCE by the Roman general Scipio as a place to house veterans from the Second Punic Wars. Itálica was also the birthplace of at least two Roman emperors.\nFor centuries, Itálica was an elaborate urban center with a temple, a theater, public baths, gorgeous homes for the monied elite, and a population of about 8,000 residents. This aerial view is of the city's famous amphitheater. It was built during the reign of Hadrian, who was emperor of Rome between the years 117 and 138 CE. Itálica's amphitheater was one of the largest in the Roman Empire. Thousands of spectators came from near and far to watch bloody gladiator fights, hunts of wild beasts, and public executions. The 'entertainment' here was not for the faint of heart.\nToday, the modern Spanish city of Santiponce has grown up around—and even atop—the ruins. Tourists come here to walk the preserved Roman streets, admire the mosaics, and imagine the scenes of life and death that happened in this amphitheater nearly 2,000 years ago.",

And because of its strategic location, Saint-Malo was, for a time, a favorite spot for pirates, corsairs, and privateers—as ships made their way through the channel, pirates lurking off the Saint-Malo coast could pounce easily while French authorities looked the other way.\nDuring World War II, in the summer of 1944, Saint-Malo was largely destroyed by American shelling and bombing as well as demolitions by occupying German forces. The Battle of Saint-Malo was the backdrop for much of the action of Anthony Doerr's 2014 award-winning novel, 'All the Light We Cannot See.' After the war, the walled city was painstakingly rebuilt, and now it's a tourist spot where visitors can walk down Saint-Malo's historic streets.",

		"description": "When 12-year-old Mary Anning uncovered the complete skeleton of a fish-like creature near her home on England's southern coast in 1811, extinction was a shaky idea in science. Fossils were nothing new—everything dies and leaves remains, after all. But could an entire species really die off? Were more of these 17-foot sea monsters lurking in the depths of the English Channel?\nThe fact that ichthyosaurs like this went extinct 90 million years ago seems obvious today (which, by the way, is National Fossil Day). But though such definite answers were still only suspicions during Mary Anning's lifetime, she persisted with paleontology. Her prolific fossil discoveries fueled both public interest and scientific understanding. Anning later discovered the plesiosaur at age 24 and the first-known pterodactyl skeleton found outside Germany at 27. Though she died young at 47, largely denied recognition as a woman in Victorian society, her influence endures like the fossils that fascinated her.",

Through their efforts decoding hieroglyphics, cataloging artifacts, and finally excavating Hatshepsut's great temple in 1906, the greatest woman ruler of her time began reclaiming her place in the history books.\nIsn't it lucky we have people willing to dirty their hands and dig up the truth?

Dimitar was hired to construct a crossing that wouldn't collapse into the rushing Arda River, as had all previous spans in this strange spot.\nHow could Dimitar build a bridge to beat all the others? By making a deal with the devil, of course. As one version of the story goes, Lucifer impelled Dimitar to encase his wife's shadow in the stonework, which imbued the bridge with supernatural strength against the rapids. The diabolical catch? Trapping her shadow meant she was doomed to death once construction was completed. Dimitar finished the bridge in 40 days, and his wife died shortly after.\nDyavolski Most (Devil's Bridge) in the Rhodope Mountains of southern Bulgaria stands tall to this day as proof of Dimitar's deadly pact. Or could it be, perhaps, that Dimitar was just a really good stonemason? Five centuries on, it's all water under the bridge…",

		"description": "Today, on the first day of Native American Heritage Month, we're visiting Bailick Park in County Cork, Ireland. Why come to the Emerald Isle on a day meant to honor the contributions of Native Americans? The answer lies in a tale of shared humanity that begins in the 19th century.\nBack in 1847, Ireland was enduring a horrific famine. Humanitarian aid poured in from all over the world, but one contribution stood out among the others—the $170 raised by the Choctaw Nation to supply food to the starving Irish. It doesn't seem like a lot, but it was equivalent to thousands in today's money. Most remarkably, the aid came from a nation of people who, just 16 years before, had been forced by the administration of US President Andrew Jackson to leave their ancestral homeland in Mississippi and march 500 miles to areas west of the Mississippi River that had been designated 'Indian Territory.' They and other forcibly relocated Native Americans endured brutal winter conditions, disease, and starvation, as well as extortion and violence by local frontiersmen, ultimately losing about a fourth of their people on the 'Trail of Tears.'\nThe Choctaw contribution to the Irish in 1847 began a long history of friendship between the two nations, and in June 2017, with a 20-strong delegation from the Choctaw Nation in attendance, this monument in County Cork, Ireland, was dedicated. Named 'Kindred Spirits,' it features nine giant stainless-steel feathers, shaped to represent a bowl of food for the hungry. The sculpture was created by Alex Pentek at the Sculpture Factory in Cork, Ireland, with assistance from students of the Crawford College of Art and Design. It's meant as a tribute—or 'Yakoke' ('Thank you' in the Choctaw language)—to the Choctaw tribe's contribution to alleviating the 'Great Hunger.' The demonstration of empathy between the two peoples continues to inspire efforts to provide assistance for people suffering from famine worldwide.",

Marigolds are one of the main symbols of this festive, two-day celebration. The flowers are native to North America, and were deemed sacred by the Aztecs, who likened their bright colors to the sun. According to legend, those colors and the flowers' sweet aroma have the power to lure the souls of the dead back to this world from beyond.\nIt's believed by most scholars that Day of the Dead, or Día de los Muertos, has roots that reach back thousands of years, long before Spanish colonization began in 1492. These Indigenous traditions eventually blended with the Catholic observances of All Saints' Day and All Souls' Day, November 1 and 2 respectively. During modern Day of the Dead festivities, Mexican families gather to eat, drink, and pay homage to their deceased friends and relatives, and if they're lucky, maybe even commune with them!",

Streets, markets, temples, and other public spaces are also illuminated with hanging lanterns like those seen in our homepage photo.\nEach day of the festival has its own significance, but day three—called Lakshmi Puja—is considered the main event.

		"description": "When the Pont Rouge (Red Bridge) of Sainte-Agathe-de-Lotbinière was built over the Palmer River in 1928, covered bridges were already commonplace here in Quebec. Simple designs imported from the United States allowed relatively untrained workers to quickly construct crossings like this. 'Ponts rouges' (often called this whether or not they were painted red) popped up wherever rural French Canadians required a convenient river crossing—as many as 1,500 were built between the late 1800s and the 1950s. Today fewer than 100 still stand, and some—like this one—are protected by local and provincial agencies for historic preservation.",

Though it's one of many marsupials found here in Western Australia, the numbat is unique, sharing no relation to any living species. It's also critically endangered: This cute specimen is one of fewer than 1,000 of its kind left in the wild.\nNumbats behave a bit like Africa's meerkats or North America's prairie dogs, often standing on hind legs to furtively scan the surroundings for predators or hiding out in hollow logs or burrows. They've always got a nose to the ground, too, searching for nests of their favorite snack: tasty termites. A single numbat often slurps up 20,000 termites a day with its long, sticky tongue, something homeowners in Western Australia surely appreciate.",

That's probably the safest way to get a close-up mug shot of this giant 'lord of the Arctic.'",

But it was the sands of time that conquered the city once and for all: Silty deposits from the river eventually mucked up the port so badly it became useless. Gradually abandoned, Kaunos' location was lost to memory, and its rock-hewn Lycian tombs, monuments, and 5,000-seat amphitheater were relegated to rumor until a British surveyor rediscovered the site in 1842.",

It was Veterans Week in New York City, and the ship was sailing across the Hudson River on its way to participate in the events. Every year on November 11 we celebrate Veterans Day and honor all service members living or dead, including these sailors. There are currently around 19 million living veterans and 1.3 million active service members in the US.\nThe USS Iwo Jima was named for the World War II battle on the Japanese island of Iwo Jima. The five-week battle saw some of the fiercest and bloodiest fighting of the Pacific war. The battle's namesake ship is in active service and has deployed over the years to Liberia, Yemen, Haiti, Israel, and Lebanon. It also provided disaster relief during Hurricane Katrina. The ship's motto, 'Uncommon Valor,' is based on the words of WWII Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz after the battle of Iwo Jima: 'Among the Americans who served on Iwo Jima, uncommon valor was a common virtue.'\nToday, we honor all who have served, living or dead. So, if you happen to see a veteran or a current service member today, be sure to tell them, 'Thank you.'",

		"description": "Today we're visiting the mountaintop town of Ronda in the Málaga province of Andalusia, in the south of Spain. First settled by the Celts and later inhabited by the Romans and Moors, this dramatic cliffside setting is split in two by the El Tajo gorge, a rocky drop plummeting nearly 400 feet to the Guadalevín River. There are three bridges that span the gorge, the largest and newest of which features in the center of our homepage image and is—appropriately enough—called Puente Nuevo (New Bridge). Despite its name, the bridge is more than a couple of centuries old—it was completed in 1793 and connects the Moorish old town, La Ciudad, with the new town, El Mercadillo.\nThe Puente Nuevo was completed by Spanish architect Jose Martín de Aldehuela, who also designed another of the historic town's famous landmarks—the open-air circular building you can see to the left of the bridge. The Plaza de Toros de Ronda is one of Spain's oldest bullrings. Built entirely of stone in the 1780s, it's considered the birthplace of modern bullfighting. It was frequented by two giants of American culture—Ernest Hemingway and Orson Welles, who were inspired by Ronda's beauty and bullfighting traditions. They spent many summers in these parts, and Welles' ashes are buried in an urn near Ronda at the country estate of his great bullfighting friend, Antonio Ordóñez.",

But manatees face threats beyond boat propellers, including habitat loss, cold stress, toxic effects of red tide, and the loss of their favorite food, seagrass. Officials in Florida have reported an unusually high number of manatee deaths in 2021, mostly due to seagrass die-offs on the eastern Florida coast.\nThe good news? Manatee populations near Florida have rallied since their low point in the early 1990s, when it was thought only about 1,200 were left. The most recent state estimates have their numbers between 7,500 and 10,200 along both Florida coasts.",

In fact, scholars in India described the sequence centuries before Fibonacci, and they probably weren't the first to figure it out either. But in any case, each November 23—that is, 11/23—we celebrate the infinite series known as the Fibonacci sequence.\nSo what does this have to do with our image of a fossilized shell? Try to picture the Fibonacci sequence on a graph. If you properly arrange squares of the areas 1x1, 1x1, 2x2, 3x3, 5x5, 8x8, etc., on graphing paper, a curved line drawn through each square will form a perfect expanding spiral not unlike the ammonite fossil cross-sectioned here.

The unusual prop has practical origins. The Zuni people have thrived in the Zuni River Valley in New Mexico for 4,000 years, and their handmade clay ollas have long been used to store food and water. A practical—if tricky—way for a Zuni woman to carry a heavy jar of water back home was to balance it on her head. Over time, the women began incorporating this skill into their dances, thus the formation of the Zuni Olla Maidens.\nWhile the entire month of November is Native American Heritage Month in the United States, today is Native American Heritage Day.

		"description": "If this image of New York City's Pennsylvania Station seems straight out of a classic film noir, it's for good reason. The photo was taken in the 1950s, just a few years before the city's beloved Beaux-Arts style masterpiece was dismantled and then demolished so that Madison Square Garden could be built atop its warren of walkways and train lines.\nThis original Pennsylvania Station opened to the public on November 27, 1910. It was built by its namesake, the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, to compete with Grand Central Station. For 50-plus years, commuters and visitors streamed in and out of the grand and imposing Penn Station to take trains to and from New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and beyond. When the building was decapitated in 1963 with only its underground network of tunnels and walkways left in place, the demolition sparked city-wide and even international outrage. 'One entered the city like a god; one scuttles in now like a rat,' wrote architectural historian Vincent Scully. There was a silver lining to the cloud of demolition dust: A collective sense of loss galvanized the movement to preserve historically significant buildings in the US.\nToday, we celebrate the anniversary of Penn Station with more good news. On January 1, 2021, the first train left Penn Station from the new Daniel Patrick Moynihan Train Hall. It's a $1.6 billion architectural masterpiece of its own, built from the adjacent US post office building and taking design cues from the original Penn Station building, pictured here. We'll toast to that!",

Or more generally: Panama, where the photo was taken.\nPanama celebrates its Independence Day today—although on this strategic, ocean-straddling strip of land, independence is complicated. When Panama broke loose from Spain on this day in 1821, it became part of Colombia until, backed by the US, it seceded in November 1903 just before the US took over construction of the Panama Canal. (The Centennial Bridge over the canal, shown here, was finished in 2003 and named to commemorate 100 years since Panama's secession from Colombia.) The US spearheaded building the international waterway, and controlled it until December 31, 1999, when Panamanians finally assumed full command of the canal, one of Panama's chief sources of revenue.",

These lithe and lightweight cats are built for speed, with compact heads, thin torsos, and long legs that help them accelerate up to 70 mph when hunting gazelles or antelopes on the savannah. Because cheetahs have uniquely flexible spines, they're able to make sharp, sudden turns, even during a high-speed chase. Individual cheetahs tend to avoid one another, but a cub like this one will stay with its mother for about 18 months, and a female cub may stick with mom into adulthood. Some males are territorial and will form small groups, called coalitions, to defend a prized area.\nInto the 19th century, cheetahs ranged across most of sub-Saharan Africa and were also abundant in the Middle East and India. Today, they live in small, isolated populations in southern and central Africa, with just a few dozen individuals left in central Iran. A 2016 estimate placed their total population at 7,100 worldwide. While cheetahs are the fastest land animal on earth, they can't outrun human encroachment and loss of habitat, and are considered a vulnerable species.",

But if your holiday wish is to be chased by an unseemly seasonal demon, the narrow, medieval streets of this city are the place to be tonight. Or this would have been the place to be if a different ghoul hadn't raised its unwelcome, spiky head—the coronavirus continues to unleash its real-world horrors, canceling tonight's scheduled Krampus runs, just as it did last year. Allow us to explain.\nThe furry, devil-horned figure of Krampus is a sidekick to Santa Claus in Alpine folklore. This mean and mischievous bogeyman travels with Saint Nick, whipping naughty kids with sticks while Santa showers the good ones with toys. Too cheery for you? In other versions of the legend, Krampus eats up the little misbehavers or drags them to hell. And you thought a lump of coal was harsh.\nThough the roots of Krampus festivities stretch back to ancient times, Austrian officials tried to stamp out the yuletide demon in the mid-20th century. But like an undead fiend, Krampus has resurged in popularity in the last decade or so, his legend spreading around the world. He's been the subject of several (mostly low-budget) horror movies in the US alone, and central Europe has seen revived Krampus-themed festivities like Salzburg's 'Krampus run.' Typically held December 5, this raucous event sees costumed Krampuses and other grotesque ghouls chase revelers through the old city. Here's hoping the horned beast returns to Salzburg next winter.",

Launched a year to the day after the Pearl Harbor attack, this vessel served nine patrols, or deployments, in the Pacific theater between 1943 and 1945. One of the top-performing US submarines of the war, Bowfin is credited with sinking 16 Japanese vessels, key strikes in helping to achieve the US victory. The decommissioned Bowfin was moved to Pearl Harbor in 1980, converted to a museum ship in 1981, and named a National Historic Landmark five years later.",

So why are these giant stone logs segmented in such symmetrical rounds, as if they're ready to be split into firewood?\nEach of these smooth splits occurred in an instant as the brittle quartz cracked under geologic pressure. But each of those instants was eons in the making. First, about 225 million years ago, the trees were buried by torrents of river silt. Then mineral deposits slowly seeped into the trees and replaced the decaying wood. Much later, around 60 million years ago, the entire Colorado Plateau began shifting, generating crushing forces that finally divided the petrified logs.\nThe fossilized trees, surrounding land, and the many plants and animals that live here have enjoyed protection since December 8, 1906, when President Theodore Roosevelt created Petrified Forest National Monument. It was designated as a national park in 1962, lending still greater protection.",

Instead, its coat transitions from brown and gray to a snowy white every autumn. The fox's pelt acts as camouflage, allowing it to blend in among the rocks and tundra for half of the year and, after turning white, hide in the snow and ice the other half.\nNote the rounded ears and short muzzle—these protect the Arctic fox against frostbite. Even the bottoms of the Arctic fox's paws are covered in fur, protecting it from the cold as it walks atop the snow and ice.

Some critics appreciated Tchaikovsky's score, but most found the choreography and dancing 'amateurish' and 'insipid.' Largely forgotten by the early 20th century, 'The Nutcracker' made its US debut with a performance by the San Francisco Ballet company in 1944. It became a true Christmastime classic when choreographer George Balanchine staged his own 1954 production with the New York City Ballet. Balanchine's version caught on and inspired other dance companies to perform it themselves.

The pretty holiday illumination you see is adorning the side of the Palais de l'Ile, a distinctive 12th-century building in the town of Annecy, France, high in the French Alps. Designated a historic monument in 1900, the medieval structure is perched on a small islet in the Canal du Thiou.\nOver the years, this 'house in the shape of a ship' has served as a palace for local nobility, a prison, a courthouse, and an administrative building for the regional government. Today, it's a museum of local history. The town of Annecy itself, dubbed 'the pearl of the French Alps,' dates back to Roman times. Over the centuries it passed to various counts and regional kingdoms before finally being annexed to France in 1860. Today it's the largest city in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region of southeastern France. Near the border with Switzerland, the area is also home to Lake Annecy, the third-largest lake in France. It's a popular tourist draw for skiers in winter, and hikers and cyclists in summer.",

While much of the Christian world celebrates Christmas on December 25, for those who follow Eastern Orthodox Christian traditions—including many Ukrainians—Christmas is still a couple weeks away. Eastern Orthodox Christmas celebrations are tied to the Julian calendar, which is 13 days behind the more universal Gregorian calendar, so Christmas Day in Ukraine will be celebrated on January 7.\nIn many Eastern European cultures, a traditional Christmas Eve dinner consists of 12 meat-free courses meant to symbolize the 12 disciples of Christ. For the Ukrainian feast, kutia, a sweet wheat grain pudding, is a star of the meal—other dishes may include braided bread, fish, and soup. The meal begins when children spot the first star that appears in the night sky. Christmas Day is typically spent in church services and with family.\nIf you're celebrating Christmas—either today or in 13 days—we wish you a merry one.",

In many British Commonwealth countries, today is known as Boxing Day, a holiday that originated in the United Kingdom. There are a few conflicting theories about its origins, but it's generally accepted that the name derives from the giving of 'boxes' to lower classes on the day after Christmas. One thing is certain—it has nothing to do with pugilism, although it has primarily become a day dedicated to sporting events and shopping, much like the Friday after Thanksgiving in the US.\nMany families also use the holiday as an opportunity to go outside and get some exercise after spending Christmas Day indoors, like these ice skaters in our homepage image. They're gliding across the Royal Pavilion Ice Rink in Brighton, on the southern coast of England. The ice rink, set in front of a royal pleasure palace built for King George IV, is said to be the only one of its kind in the UK powered entirely by green energy. It is located within Brighton's bustling North Laine district, a popular shopping area that is sure to be busy today. As you shop for bargains and enjoy those tasty turkey leftovers, consider paying homage to Boxing Day's origins by helping those who are less fortunate.",

These medium-sized Arctic specialists love the cold and travel farther north than other passerine birds. Only ravens can be found north of snow buntings.\nBut when winter weather approaches in the Northern Hemisphere, snow buntings migrate south and settle across southern Canada, the northern US, and parts of Europe and central Asia. By early April, male snow buntings will begin their long return to the cold north to search for quality nesting areas, with female buntings arriving about six weeks after the males. While these birds are not currently endangered, the effects of global warming could potentially impact future populations, as a warmer climate threatens to shrink their habitats and upset the balance between their peak breeding and feeding seasons.",

Harp seals are one of five types of seals that populate Jones Beach from November to May. They travel from as far away as the Canadian Arctic and northwestern Greenland to rest up and feed before making their way north again in the spring.\nHarp seals can sleep in the water, too, with almost their entire body submerged, save for the snout. They tend to hang out in groups on land because it's safest that way. A harp seal can live up to 35 years provided it isn't hunted for its pelt as a newborn, or gobbled up by a polar bear, orca, or great white shark as a juvenile or adult. Here, at Jones Beach State Park, harp seals live out of harm's way. They're protected from hunters, while the sharks have migrated south for the winter. So, rest up, little friend.

Constructed between 1876 and 1887, the Lick Observatory has been the site of significant discoveries, including several of Jupiter's moons and other planetary systems. It's named for American real-estate entrepreneur James Lick, who set aside $700,000 for the University of California to build a facility that would be home to a 'telescope superior to and more powerful than any telescope yet made.'\nHis wish came true. The 36-inch refracting telescope on Mount Hamilton was the largest that had ever been built when it saw first light on January 3, 1888, a distinction it held until the construction of the 40-inch refractor at Wisconsin's Yerkes Observatory in 1897. Sadly, Lick died before his vision became a reality, but his name lives on. His body is even buried beneath the telescope, which continues to scan the skies today.",

An underground cave system connects this swimming hole to the nearby ocean, and the water rises and falls with the tides.\n'To Sua' translates to English as 'big hole.' While accurate, it feels like an understatement in this context. For adventurous visitors to Upolu Island, To Sua Ocean Trench can feel like a trip to another world. To get to this natural saltwater pool, make your way along a cliffside path surrounded by lush forest. Then climb down to the waters via the wooden ladder. After your swim, you can squeeze through a cave-like lava tube to find yourself on a short, sandy beach.",

We've wandered here because this is the enchanted forest that inspired author A.A. Milne's depiction of Winnie-the-Pooh's neighborhood, the Hundred Acre Wood. It's our way of celebrating Winnie-the-Pooh Day, observed each year by the Pooh faithful on January 18, Milne's birthday. The author, along with help from illustrator E.H. Shepard, introduced the world to Pooh and his many forest friends with the beloved 'Winnie-the-Pooh' books, first published in 1926.\nMilne owned a home on the northern edge of Ashdown Forest called Cotchford Farm, and the author drew inspiration from these woods for many of the settings in his series. The real-life Five Hundred Acre Wood became Hundred Acre Wood, while the hill called Gills Lap became Galleon's Leap. Milne also modeled the character Christopher Robin after his real son, Christopher Robin Milne, who himself spent much time as a child in these very woods. If there's any doubt about the importance of Ashdown Forest to the 'Pooh' books, Christopher Milne himself once described the real-life and fictional forests as 'identical.'",

Breeding season for these birds begins by October, when they gather in colonies of thousands, coupling off and constructing nests made of stones.\nWhen it comes to parenting, Adélie couples are true partners. The female lays two eggs, and then the parents each take turns incubating them in 12-day shifts until the chicks hatch after about a month. The chicks remain in the nest for around 22 days, while both parents again take turns, this time by feeding and guarding them. Once March rolls around, the parents return to sea, bringing their young along with them. They'll spend the winter foraging for food among the icebergs.",

The large rock on the left is said to be the husband, Izanagi, and at its peak is a small torii, a symbolic gateway marking the entrance to a Shinto shrine. The smaller rock represents his wife, Izanami.\nThe smitten sea stacks are joined together in matrimony by a thick rope braided of rice straw called 'shimenawa,' which is used as a symbol of purity and protection in the Shinto religion. The sacred rope is replaced in a special ceremony, held three times each year during the months of May, September, and December. The best time to see the rocks is at dawn during summer or twilight in winter, when the sun and moon, respectively, rise between them.

Each year on January 25, Cupid aims his arrow toward the people of Wales who celebrate St. Dwynwen's Day—the Welsh version of St. Valentine's Day. St. Dwynwen is Wales' patron saint of lovers, although she was rather unlucky in that department after falling head over heels for a man she wasn't allowed to marry. The 5th-century princess's heartache led her to dedicate her life to God and pray for true lovers to have better fortune than her own. In return, Dwynwen became a nun and set up a convent here on Llanddwyn.\nDespite its name, Llanddwyn Island is cut off from Anglesey's mainland only during very high tides. Since the 19th century, it has been home to Tŵr Mawr lighthouse (meaning 'great tower' in Welsh). The design of the lighthouse, seen in our photo today, is inspired by the area's many windmills. Just out of frame, you will find the remains of the church Dwynwen founded, along with a well named after her. It became a place of pilgrimage following her death. Legend has it that the well is home to sacred fish that can predict whether couples' relationships will succeed.",

But those tiny false 'ears,' which may function as display feathers or camouflage, lend the owl a distinctive appearance, and the short-eared owl is often affectionately called 'shortie.' Here in England, short-eared owls are seen more frequently in winter, when their numbers are boosted by an influx of continental birds migrating from Scandinavia, Russia, and Iceland.\nUnlike most owls, the short-eared owl often prefers to be out and about during the daytime, which is good news for British birdwatchers this weekend. Over the next few days, around 1 million people across the UK are expected to take part in the Big Garden Birdwatch, one of the world's largest wildlife surveys. Beginners and birding experts alike grab their binoculars and spend an hour counting birds they see landing in their garden or local green space.

		"description": "To mark the beginning of Black History Month, we're paying tribute to one of the few all-Black combat regiments in World War I, true heroes who were instrumental in achieving the Allied victory. The storied 369th Infantry Regiment, famously known as the Harlem Hellfighters, served in frontline trenches for 191 days—longer than any other American unit in the war—and suffered 1,500 casualties, the most losses of any American regiment. They fought under the 16th Division of the French army, because many white Americans refused to go into combat alongside Black soldiers.\nBut the men of the 369th quickly proved their bravery and combat skills. Their heroism in battle earned them the respect of their French comrades, who awarded them—before any other American unit—the prestigious Croix de Guerre, France's highest award for bravery. It also earned them the fear of the enemy—media reports credited the Germans for bestowing their nickname, 'Hollenkampfer,' or 'Hellfighters.'\nSoldiers of the 369th are pictured here on February 17, 1919, on their victorious return to New York City after the war. Around 250,000 people gathered to greet them. Accompanied by music from the Hellfighters band, led by James Reese Europe, they paraded north from Fifth Avenue at 23rd Street to 145th and Lenox in Harlem. Around 70% of the regiment's members called Harlem home, and their family, friends, and neighbors were among those cheering their return. On this day during a month that would eventually be set aside for Black history, these soldiers were given a hero's welcome. A few months later, as General John J. Pershing led soldiers along Fifth Avenue in a much larger victory parade, not one Black soldier was honored. Despite the sacrifice and bravery of the Harlem Hellfighters, the country remained segregated, both in its military and its society writ large.",

The monarchs remain in Mexico from around November to March.\nUpon arrival in the Mexican state of Michoacán, they settle into the forests of fir trees like those shown here. Then they begin finding their way to milkweed plants to mate and lay their eggs. The eggs hatch after just a few days, leaving the offspring to feast on the milkweed before eventually transforming into the next generation of adult butterflies.

Though Pueblo peoples here in northern New Mexico made pictographs in this style several centuries ago, there's no evidence they were depicting extraterrestrials. But don't get us wrong: We want to believe.\nToday is Extraterrestrial Culture Day, a holiday that enjoys official status in New Mexico thanks to the 'Roswell incident' of 1947. Depending who you ask, the metallic wreck found on a remote ranch in New Mexico one July morning was either a weather balloon, a top-secret military device disguised as a weather balloon, or a bona fide alien craft. Whatever the truth, the nearby town of Roswell has gone all-in on UFO lore. It's home to numerous UFO-themed attractions, chief among them the International UFO Museum and Research Center.",

The ceiling fresco—a mix of stained glass, hand-painted detail, and LED lighting—recalls artwork from the Italian Renaissance, with vibrant blue skies and heavenly clouds. But in Wiley's interpretation, the religious figures common in such works are replaced by Black Americans in modern-day clothing—seemingly weightless in the air, in poses reminiscent of breakdancing moves.\nWiley first gained attention with his vibrant portraits of Black men and women. These works often referenced the classical 18th-century portraits of Western Europe. But the artist toyed with those conventions by featuring figures in modern attire against stylized backgrounds.",

Conservation efforts have brought their numbers in the wild up to about 31,000 today.\nAt full sprint, bison can run up to 35 mph even though they can weigh over a ton. Big, fast, and strong, these heavyweights are built for the Great Plains, or the gridiron.",

These 380 square miles of diverse countryside include rolling grasslands, river valleys, hillsides, and ancient woodlands. The area has been inhabited since the Stone Age, and for centuries was a royal hunting ground—in fact, the word 'chase' derives from these hunts.

Flamenco is packed with passion and drama, as performers transmit their deepest emotions—from sadness and regret to exuberance and joy—through body movements and facial expressions. But flamenco is more than just a dance: It's an art form that mixes dancing with singing, guitar playing, clapping, and finger snapping.\nThe origins of flamenco are shrouded in mystery, but the centuries-old tradition is commonly associated with the Romani people of Andalusia, in the south of Spain. The dancers seen here are performing outside Palma de Majorca, on the Spanish Balearic island of Majorca, an indication that despite its Andalusian origins, flamenco has spread to all corners of Spain. Nevertheless, it's the Andalusian city of Jerez that's at the heart of the flamenco scene. On any given night, you'll find bailaoras (female dancers) in traditional red dresses performing in local flamenco venues known as 'tablaos.' Every year, Jerez celebrates its flamenco heritage with a world-renowned festival, simply known as the Festival de Jerez. Over the next two weeks, the festival will feature events, classes, and performances by famous flamenco artists.",

Graffiti taggers were given the option of either going to jail or participating in the new initiative. Easy choice!

Perhaps no other creature is as emblematic of climate change as polar bears, the apex predator of the Arctic. As the planet warms, their fragile habitat shrinks.\nIn the fall, after the ice floes have diminished, making hunting more difficult, a pregnant female polar bear will dig a maternity den, usually in a snowdrift. She lies dormant there through the winter before giving birth sometime between November and February. The cubs, born blind and with only a light layer of fur, weigh just about a pound at birth. In the cold Arctic winter, the newborns would suffer outside the protection of the den, so they rest there with their mom, growing rapidly on her fat-rich milk until the young family breaks open the entrance to the den sometime in early spring.\nThis mother and her cubs are enjoying a spring day in Manitoba, Canada, in Wapusk National Park, where the Arctic tundra yields to a boreal forest.

Beyond the mountain, the 369-square-mile park also includes valleys, waterfalls, old-growth forest, and pristine alpine meadows famous for summer wildflowers.\nRainier is considered the most glaciated peak in the contiguous US. Native Americans named it Tahoma, which translates to 'mother of waters.' Indeed, the mountain spawns five major rivers, and to this day, its snowmelt provides much of the water for the region.\nAlthough beautiful, Rainier is also one of the most dangerous volcanoes in the world. Scientists consider an eruption in the near future to be highly probable. In addition to spewing ash and triggering landslides, a major eruption would likely cause massive mudflows, called lahars. These lahars would send a surge of mud, boulders, and debris hurtling toward the Seattle-Tacoma metropolitan area, less than 65 miles away. For now, we'll just admire the majesty of this sleeping giant and be thankful that the national park protects so much pristine northwest wilderness.",

But with the concerted efforts of Indian and Nepalese wildlife authorities, the population of greater one-horned rhinos has slowly built back up to around 3,700 today.\nThis megaherbivore, noted for its single black horn, is considered a keystone species due to the disproportionately important role it plays in its native ecosystem. Conservation efforts have concentrated on the rhinos' traditional habitat in the grasslands and woodlands of northeastern India and southern Nepal. The rhinos are especially important to the health of the ecosystem there because they love to wallow in puddles of water—by doing so they help to protect, expand, and create water holes that are also used by other animals, significantly enriching the habitat for all.",

		"description": "The 2022 Winter Paralympics begins today in Beijing, as the Chinese capital becomes the first city to host both the summer and winter editions of the Paralympic Games. Over the next 10 days, about 600 athletes will compete in 78 different events across six sports—alpine skiing, cross-country skiing, biathlon, snowboarding, para ice hockey, and wheelchair curling. All the events will take place in a strict Covid 'bubble' system to ensure safety at the Games.\nSpeaking of bubbles, today we're looking at the National Aquatics Center, a box-shaped building that will host the wheelchair curling events. The design of the bubble-wrapped façade—made from a thin, transparent material called ETFE—is based on the Weaire-Phelan geometric structure, which is derived from the natural pattern of bubbles in soap lather. The building was originally built to host the swimming, diving, and synchronized swimming competitions at the 2008 Summer Olympics and Paralympics. Nicknamed the Water Cube for the Summer Games, the building's pool has been turned into an ice rink for the winter events, so the venue has been redubbed the Ice Cube, at least temporarily. It's the first sports arena in the world that can switch between water and ice.",

		"description": "Rising majestically out of the bay, Mont-Saint-Michel is once again a true island, at least during high tides. A crude, elevated causeway built in the 19th century once connected Mont-Saint-Michel to the mainland, allowing visitors to walk across to the spectacular rock. But in 2014, the causeway was removed and replaced by an elegant, curving bridge above the tidal flats. Now water flows freely around the monument at high tide, making the tiny island fortress a real island for the first time in more than a century.\nToday's visitors are following in the footsteps of pilgrims who for centuries traversed Europe to pray at the sacred site. The local bishop of Avranches built a chapel on this rock in 708 after the archangel St. Michael visited him in a dream, and the rest, as they say, is history. Now the island, half a mile off the coast of Normandy in northwestern France, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Its permanent population is fewer than 50 people, including a dozen or so monks and nuns, but more than 3 million visitors cross over to the island most years.",

As a result, cormorants must come ashore to dry themselves by spreading their wings open for long periods. This behavior may also help with digestion or regulate their body temperature. Or maybe they're just showing off.",

		"description": "Here on New Zealand's rugged South Island, the waters of Lake Tekapo display such striking electric-blue colors because of glacial silt flowing into the lake, carried by the braided Godley and Macauley Rivers, seen at the bottom of our image. These rivers are themselves fed by the melted waters of glaciers in the nearby Southern Alps. As these active glaciers slowly bulldoze the mountainsides, they pulverize rocks along valley floors and walls. All that grinding eventually produces a fine-grained powder of silt, sometimes called glacial flour. Meltwater picks up the silt, carrying it downstream and into lakes like Tekapo. The particles are so light and fine, they're slow to sink to the bottom, remaining suspended in the water column instead.\nThe name Tekapo is a misspelling of the Māori word Takapō, which means 'to leave in haste at night.' But if you are one of the region's many visitors, you may find the nighttime even more mesmerizing than the day. Lake Tekapo is a certified Dark Sky Reserve, one of the world's largest. With night skies almost completely free of light pollution, stargazing doesn't get much more vibrant, and tours cater to manuhiri (visitors) interested in astro-tourism. If that's not reason enough to stay the night, the area's abundant skiing and fishing opportunities might be. There's certainly no need to leave in a rush.",

		"description": "This famous feisty girl stands her ground in front of the New York Stock Exchange in lower Manhattan, a striking reminder as we celebrate International Women's Day that we still have work to do in the quest for gender equality. Kristen Visbal's bronze sculpture 'Fearless Girl' took up her power pose in 2017 facing down the iconic Wall Street bronze statue called 'Charging Bull.' For the 2021 observance of International Women's Day, the corporate sponsor of 'Fearless Girl' added broken glass around her, with a plaque that read: \"Today's broken glass ceilings are tomorrow's stepping stones.\"\nWhile many glass ceilings are indeed being broken, much work remains in the fight for gender equality in pay and opportunity. The National Women's Law Center reports that US women who work full time earn 82 cents for every dollar paid to men performing similar work. And those lost cents add up. One study suggests the disparity is stark: Over a lifetime, a woman in the US can be denied hundreds of thousands of dollars in pay. And the losses are especially pronounced among Black women, who remain underrepresented in high-earning positions.\nThe 2022 theme for International Women's Day is #BreakTheBias, and organizers call on us to imagine a 'world free of bias, stereotypes, and discrimination…A world that is diverse, equitable, and inclusive.' Bring it on.",

For much of the Middle Ages, the Bobbio Abbey and its vast library made the town a center of religion, culture, and learning.\nThese days, Bobbio is a regular tourist stop perhaps best known for its old bridge, or Ponte Vecchio (not to be confused with THE Ponte Vecchio in Florence). Bobbio's old bridge spans the River Trebbia with 11 arches of unequal size and is commonly called Ponte Gobbo (Hunchback Bridge), because of its irregular shape.\nBobbio remains a jewel box of a town frozen in time. With its many small churches, modest houses, and cobblestone streets, Bobbio maintains the character of a medieval village nestled in the Trebbia Valley. Ernest Hemingway described the Val Trebbia as 'the most beautiful in the world,' and with views like this, who could argue with him?",

		"description": "Today we're celebrating 110 years of the Girl Scouts! Sure, we enjoy their cookies every year, but with so much history behind the organization, the Girl Scouts deserve merit badges for more than just the Thin Mint. On March 12, 1912, founder Juliette Gordon Low brought an outfit called the Girl Guides stateside from England after befriending the founder of the scouting movement there. The first American troop had 18 girls participating. Low designed activities to allow girls to serve their communities, experience the outdoors, and develop self-reliance and resourcefulness. Those skills would be useful on the camping expedition seen in today's photo. These girls can be seen along the shore of Todd Lake at the Deschutes National Forest in Oregon in 1960.\nOfficially renamed Girl Scouts of the United States of America in 1913, the organization had a hand in relief efforts during the Great Depression and World War II. Girl Scouts also have a long history leading events that support civil rights—Martin Luther King called the group 'a force for desegregation.' In recent years, the scouts have focused on environmental and social issues, and have made headlines as transgender allies.\nIf all that's not enough of a reason to celebrate the Girl Scouts, then, OK, consider the cookies. Girl Scout Cookies have been produced on a commercial scale since 1934, though individual sales have been documented much earlier. Called the largest annual fundraiser in the world dedicated to girls, every year more than 1 million scouts sell over 200 million packages of cookies, raising more than $800 million. The Thin Mints variety amounts to 25% of all sales. We'll raise a glass of milk to the Girl Scouts today as we sample our favorite cookies.",

It's the second Sunday of March, when most Americans and Canadians 'spring forward,' setting their clocks ahead one hour in observance of daylight saving time (DST). Then on the first Sunday of November, we'll 'fall back' by turning our clocks back an hour.\nThe practice of resetting clocks with the seasons became widespread during World War I, first in Germany, as a way to conserve coal used for heating homes. Other European countries followed suit, and the US did, too, in 1918, but that lasted just two years. The US brought it back during World War II, and observing daylight saving time has remained standard practice ever since. Initially it was a mess, with a patchwork of some cities observing it and others not—at one point the Twin Cities of St. Paul and Minneapolis were on different clocks!\nFinally, passage of the Uniform Time Act of 1966 got most places in the US marching to the same daily drumbeat. Congress added about a month of DST in 1986 and again in 2007. But not everyone is on board. Arizona and Hawaii do not observe daylight saving time, and dozens of states have introduced legislation to end it permanently.",

Pi Day is a relatively recent phenomenon—invented by a physicist in 1988 and designated by Congress a national holiday in 2009. But it's already almost certainly the most popular holiday celebrating a mathematical constant. While Pi Day is a young tradition, the number π (pi) itself has been a fascination since antiquity, when it was first calculated as the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter.\nYou probably know that March 14 was chosen for Pi Day since the date expressed numerically (in month/date format) matches the number's first digits, 3.14. Aside from eating pie to celebrate, some people go to great lengths to memorize digits that go way beyond 3.141592…, which earns them bragging rights in some, um, circles. The world record is a staggering 70,000 digits after the decimal point—the remarkable feat was achieved by 21-year-old student Rajveer Meena in 2015.\nTake a moment from your Pi Day revelry to appreciate the unintentional π symbol formed by this Neolithic burial chamber in Cornwall, England. As the morning sun warms Lanyon Quoit's ancient stones, it's impossible not to wonder who built it and how, since it predates metal tools and is older than Egypt's pyramids. Theories abound, of course, but could π have been involved?",

According to the ancient historian Plutarch, Caesar had been warned by a seer that his life would be in danger no later than the Ides of March, something that William Shakespeare dramatizes in his famous tragedy of Caesar’s life and assassination. While historical fact and fiction can diverge, we do know that before March 15, 44 BCE was over, a group of senators had intercepted Caesar here in the Forum as Caesar was on his way to the Senate House. They stabbed him 23 times, killing him. Afterward, Rome descended into civil war, ending the Roman Republic, and leading to the rise of the Roman Empire.\nThe Forum was a city square in which Rome's commercial, political, and religious activity took place, along with the occasional assassination. It was a site of ceremonies and celebrations. It was where Mark Antony's famed funeral oration for Caesar was given, and where Caesar's body was burned before the public. Today the area is a popular tourist attraction, drawing more than 4.5 million visitors in an average year.",

Pandas are one of the animals we recognize from an early age. But while we may take them for granted, they've been under threat from shrinking habitats and food supply as people harvest bamboo and build roads and train tracks through their forests. National Panda Day on March 16 spreads awareness about these beloved bears and encourages us to safeguard their future.\nThere are currently about 1,800 giant pandas living in their native habitat of central China and another 600 or so in zoos. These figures represent a slight increase over population counts of the early 2000s, perhaps a result of dedicated conservation efforts. With the rise in numbers, the International Union for Conservation of Nature reclassified the giant panda in 2016 from 'endangered' to 'vulnerable.'\nThis giant panda is scratching a tree to mark its territory in the Wolong National Nature Reserve in China's Sichuan province, which has implemented strict conservation measures to protect pandas. Soon, no doubt, this one will scout out some tasty bamboo shoots. Bamboo makes up 99% of a panda's diet, and an adult bear must consume more than 30 pounds (some manage 80!) of the woody grass each day to meet its dietary needs. While that sounds like a hefty amount, giant pandas digest only 17% of that bamboo. Since eating occupies about 14 of its waking hours, the giant panda has a couple of physiological tools to help: The bone at the base of its paw works as a modified thumb so it can get a firm grip on the bamboo, and its molars are very broad and flat to crush the bamboo shoots, leaves, and stems.",

St. Patrick is often depicted holding a shamrock, which he purportedly used to explain Christianity in Ireland by saying the leaves illustrated the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit of the Holy Trinity. Never mind that Celtic druids had revered the sacred shamrock and its three leaves long before Patrick's arrival. Coins depicting St. Patrick with a shamrock date back as far as 1675.\nLegends of St. Patrick abound. For example, he's said to have driven the snakes out of Ireland, but most experts would suggest it was the cool, damp weather that kept the serpents from ever arriving there in the first place. Tradition has it that he died on March 17 of the year 461 CE, and one can only assume that a year later the first green beer was served.\nWhether you find yourself in Dublin, on the California coast, or any point in between today, we leave you with a traditional Irish toast: 'May your glass be ever full.

		"description": "Did you check the weather forecast today? Does it look like rain? Will it turn colder? What's the outlook for the weekend? These questions may seem commonplace, even mundane, but the answers can be of crucial importance. Given our reliance on weather prediction, let's tip the rain hat to the world's weather experts on World Meteorological Day, celebrated each March 23 by the United Nation's World Meteorological Organization (WMO).\nThe 2022 theme for World Meteorological Day is 'Early Warning and Early Action. Hydrometeorological and Climate Information for Disaster Risk Reduction.' That's a mouthful, but it essentially boils down to the importance of predicting high-precipitation weather events and mitigating or preventing the damage caused by them.\nWorldwide, floods cause more than $40 billion in damage each year. They're the most common type of natural disaster. In the United States flash floods claim more lives than tornadoes, hurricanes, or lightning. But with accurate predictions and appropriate warning systems, people living in an area likely to flood can know the severity of upcoming threats and plan accordingly. Thanks to the study of hydrometeorology, forecasts can predict the impact days and even weeks in advance. Long-term projections can even give an idea of what's coming several months from now.

		"description": "Shhh, it's sleeping. But don't confuse that with hibernating. A tree squirrel, like this red squirrel in Scotland, doesn't hibernate during the winter. Hibernating is more of a ground squirrel trait. But the red squirrel is particular about where it sleeps, mostly building its nest, or drey, high above the ground in the cavity of an evergreen tree. Nests are often lined with soft materials such as leaves, moss, and grass. This little sleeper is using its bushy tail to keep warm, with the help of some lichen and pine needles.\nIn Scotland and elsewhere in the United Kingdom, the native red squirrel is threatened by the much more prominent, non-native North American gray squirrel. The American transplants tend to outcompete the red squirrels for food and living space. While there are millions of gray squirrels in the UK, it's estimated only 120,000 to 160,000 red squirrels remain, about three-quarters of them in Scotland. Conservation efforts focus on preserving red squirrel habitat and combating the spread of gray squirrels.",

Tolkien's novels 'The Lord of the Rings' and 'The Hobbit.' Like Tolkien's mythical Elf settlement, Lauterbrunnen Valley has a bit of storybook appeal, with an unusually narrow valley floor hemmed in by steep Alpine cliffs and dotted with numerous waterfalls. Lauterbrunnen became popular among mountain climbers and hikers beginning in the late 19th century, and Tolkien hiked through the valley in 1911. The valley remains a popular tourist destination.\nThe Tolkien Society organized the first Tolkien Reading Day in 2003 to celebrate and promote his works. They selected March 25 as it is the day that the Dark Lord Sauron was defeated and the Black Tower destroyed in 'The Lord of the Rings.' Tolkien's writing continues to provide fodder for various entertainment forms, with Amazon's TV series 'Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power' debuting later this year.",

Crocuses are perennial, flowering bulbs that are built for toughness. As you can see, the plants are able to endure frost and even snow because their flowers and leaves are protected by a waxy cuticle. That's why the first blooms you see in spring are often crocuses. They can grow in a variety of environments, even in the high elevations of the alpine tundra above the tree line.\nWhile other blooms are still slumbering, crocuses are up and at 'em. Naturally, they are magnets for brave bees and birds, like this great tit coming in for a snow-covered landing. The birds are widespread and common in Europe, the Middle East, and Central Asia—and they know a sure sign of spring when they see one.",

Hundreds of wisteria plants were meticulously cultivated to form tunnels that bloom with shades of blue, white, purple, and pink. The walkable tunnels open into large domes of wisteria vines for visitors to sit under and bask in the fragrant flowers. An overlook gives visitors an impressive view of not only the flowers but also the surrounding valley and its bamboo groves.\nThe private garden wasn't necessarily intended to be a tourist destination. Founder Masao Higuchi just wanted to leave something behind as proof that he lived in this world. Work began on the garden in 1968 and in 1977 the garden was open to the public. If you want to see the garden, plan accordingly. It's only open for two brief periods a year: the wisteria season between late April and early May and the equally impressive maple season. In autumn more than 700 maple trees change color, bringing another blast of color from mid-November to early December.",

(And if you like a glass of milk with your cookies…) The heritage breed originated in the southwest of Scotland, and it thrives on the region's rough pastures and windswept slopes. Belted Galloways fight the elements with a double-layer coat: The long, coarse hair diverts rain, and beneath that, the cow has a soft undercoat to keep it warm and dry in the harsh Scottish winters.\nHow did these cattle get that signature white belt? It's believed that black Galloway cattle were crossbred with Lakenvelder (Dutch Belted) cows in the 17th or 18th centuries. While the black-and-white look is most common, the cattle can also sport a reddish or dun-colored coat, always with that distinctive creamy white belt.\nBelted Galloways are known for their top-quality marbled beef, although they are also raised as dairy cattle. Some breeders—known as 'Belties' in the biz—keep the cattle for their calm temperament and eye-catching coat. Although they are still a Scottish favorite, Belted Galloways can now be found in other countries too. So if you ever see Oreos in a field…",

		"description": "Locally, it's called 'La dame de fer,' which translates to English as 'The Iron Lady.' To the rest of the world, it's the Eiffel Tower, a landmark nearly synonymous with all things Parisian. It's one of the most recognizable structures in the world and the most visited monument with an entrance fee. The Eiffel Tower took 500 workers two years, two months, and five days to complete. Most of the structural work was finished by the end of March 1889 and to celebrate, the builders led a group of government officials and journalists to the top of the tower on March 31. It was, at the time, the highest man-made structure in the world. With the addition of a new radio antenna on March 15, 2022, the Eiffel Tower grew an additional 20 feet and is now 1,083 feet tall, just in time for its 133rd birthday.\nWarm weather in summer causes the iron in the structure to expand, so the Eiffel Tower actually grows by up to around 7 inches. On a particularly windy day, if you look closely, maybe you'll notice the natural swaying movement of the tower near the top. That wind gets collected by turbines on the second level, which convert it into electricity for the tower's shops and restaurants. There's also a rainwater collection system that's used for the toilet tanks. The Eiffel Tower gets a fresh paint job roughly every seven years. Originally it was dark red, then yellow, but has been 'Eiffel Tower Brown' for the past 54 years. It takes around 16,000 gallons of paint to get the job done.",

		"description": "In honor of April Fools' Day, take a moment to appreciate this trick of the eye created by the French street artist and photographer who goes by the name JR. He's known for surreptitiously posting large black-and-white photographs in public locations, often in humorous contexts. This cheeky public-art piece from 2021 was installed in the desert sands of the Giza pyramid complex in Egypt. The installation makes it look as if the detached tip of the Pyramid of Khafre magically hovers above its base.\nKhafre is the second-largest pyramid in the Giza complex, smaller only than the Great Pyramid, whose capstone has been missing for all of modern history. (That's no joke.) The Great Pyramid's missing top has been the subject of much speculation and scholarly pursuit. This complex of pyramids was built around 2,600 to 2,500 BCE.\nVisual illusions in art, a technique known as trompe l'oeil, are a specialty of JR, born in Paris in 1983 to a Tunisian mother. He always appears in public wearing a fedora and sunglasses, and has revealed very little of his identity. The enigmatic artist is most famous for making the glass-and-metal Louvre pyramid 'disappear.'",

Turtle Head is the perfect launching point for a visit to the lake, where visitors can explore scenic trails, formal gardens, bridges, and overlooks.\nThe cherry trees bloom for about 10 days, usually starting in late March and early April. If the scene evokes thoughts of Japan, you're on the right track as the viewing of blossoms is a long-standing tradition in Japan. In fact, the trees of Lake Tai were a gift from Japanese visitors who helped plant them in Wuxi. Now there is no doubt when spring arrives.",

And though it isn't the island's highest waterfall—that would be Morsarfoss at over 787 feet—or most powerful (the thundering Dettifoss), Goðafoss, has, within its swirling waters, its own story to tell.\nAn Icelandic legend holds that in 1000 CE, a well-respected pagan priest and chieftain named Thorgeir Thorkelsson was tasked with deciding if Iceland was to become a Christian nation or if it would continue to worship the ancient Nordic gods. The peace of the island was at stake, with fierce advocates on each side. Thorgeir decided in favor of Christianity, but with the caveat that those who chose to continue to recognize the old gods would not be punished so long as they converted. This tale, likely created in the 19th century, says that after Thorgeir converted to Christianity he returned to his home near Goðafoss and hurled his statues of the Norse gods into the falls, which is said to have angered the old gods so much that they split the waterfall in two. However the falls came to be, we'll just admire the result, especially when they're illuminated by the green glow of the northern lights.",

In the meantime, we think they make ideal mascots for Siblings Day, celebrated in the US and Canada on April 10.\nFully grown caracals are trim and sleek, with long legs built for speed that have springs inside (not really) to help them leap as high as 10 feet to catch birds in midflight. They're incredibly stealthy—they even have stiff fur on the pads of their feet to quiet their steps. It's not surprising that they're also known as the desert lynx, as they are the fastest—and largest—of the small cats in Africa, but they're only distantly related to actual lynx. Caracals' short coat is a gorgeous gold, but it's those distinctive face markings and ear tufts that give them character (in fact, 'caracal' is a Turkish word that means 'black-eared'). There's debate in the wildlife community about the purpose of the tufts. Some believe they enhance the cats' hearing or help camouflage the caracals in the dry areas of Africa, India, and the Middle East they call home; others think tuft twitching is a way to communicate.\nThroughout history the caracal has been prized for its skill at leaping high to pluck birds out of the air and catching small game, such as mongooses, rodents, and monkeys—even a stray impala or small kudu. Indian and Chinese rulers used them for hunting and bestowed them as gifts. In recent years, caracal numbers have been dropping, largely due to agricultural encroachment on their habitat. Caracals will kill livestock if they're hungry, and of course farmers and ranchers object, often with shotguns. On the plus side, caracals do keep small grass-eating critters under control, which leaves more pasture for livestock to eat. For the sake of these charismatic cats, we're rooting for peaceful coexistence.",

You'll want to research which varieties are safe to eat. Some have been found to cause cancer, particularly if they're not properly cooked. In North America, the ostrich fern is the one most commonly eaten but it's important that you don't pick every shoot or else you might kill the plant. After you have a successful, safe, and sustainable harvest, steam or boil the fiddleheads to ensure they're thoroughly cooked.

While the flowering buds are beautiful in their natural state, the mitsumata shrub (Edgeworthia chrysantha) has so much more to offer.

No wonder, then, that it's also known as the Oriental paperbush. Mitsumata washi is dense and holds ink well—it's a favorite of artists and calligraphers—and sheets of mitsumata paper are also used in traditional shoji screens.\nIt's this very versatility and strength that made mitsumata a natural candidate for Japanese banknotes. The dense, short fiber from the inner layer of bark helps create sturdy currency that can withstand millions of grubby hands and transactions. Mitsumata made its banknote debut in 1879, and it's still used in Japanese currency today.\nWant to see mitsumata in bloom? Spring's the time to catch the golden flowers, and gardeners note that you'll smell the heady, almost spicy fragrance before you see the bush itself. After the flowers fade, the leaves take on a bluish, silvery hue, and in autumn they turn golden themselves.",

		"description": "Grab your boots and gear, today we're heading to Arizona to hike out to Horseshoe Bend. Known as the 'east rim of the Grand Canyon,' it's actually about 140 miles from the other rims and is really more a part of nearby Glen Canyon. Scientifically, the beautiful view exists thanks to something called an 'entrenched meander.' Around 6 million years ago, the area was closer to sea level. The Colorado River, following the path of least resistance, meandered and became trapped when the Colorado Plateau uplifted around 5 million years ago. Over time, the river water cut through exposed sandstone, forming the thousand-foot-deep, 270-degree horseshoe-shaped bend.\nHorseshoe Bend used to be a locally loved gem until social media came around to spread photos like this one. Now, nearly 2 million tourists a year visit this natural wonder. It's believed that eventually the Colorado River will cut through the neck of the bend. So, if you want your selfie with the horseshoe, you only have another million years, give or take.",

Completed and staged 16 months after Christo's death at age 84, 'Wrapped' was the fruition of an idea 60 years in the making. On view for 16 days from Saturday, September 18 to Sunday, October 3, 2021, the project required 270,000 square feet of recyclable silvery-blue polypropylene fabric that completely covered the monument. The fabric glistened and glimmered with the changing light of Paris. The pleated fabric was held fast to the arch by nearly 2 miles of red rope.\nOver the decades, artistic partners Christo and Jeanne-Claude created several large-scale installations at famous landmarks around the world, using fabric in tandem with landscapes and structures like Berlin's Reichstag and New York's Central Park.\nWorld Art Day was declared by the International Association of Art, a UNESCO partner, as an international celebration of the fine arts, and to promote awareness of creative activity all over the world. It is celebrated every April 15, which also aptly marks the birthday of Leonardo da Vinci, the embodiment of creativity.",

		"description": "Only a very small percentage of Yellowstone's total visitors see the park when it looks like this. In winter, when the park grows quiet, its hydrothermal features really stand out, like the rainbow-hued Grand Prismatic Spring in the bottom center of this image, the most photographed feature in Yellowstone.\nJust the inspiration we need as we start National Park Week, an occasion to celebrate the splendor of our park system and turn to thoughts of hiking, paddling, and camping. The 'week' is actually a bit longer, starting today and running through Sunday, April 24. Yellowstone was established by Congress 150 years ago as the nation's first national park. Today, there are 63, and they include the volcanoes of Hawaii, the giant sequoias of California, the Grand Canyon, and the desolate moonscape of the Badlands.\nPerhaps no national park better captures the American landscape than Yellowstone, 3,500 square miles of lakes, canyons, rivers, mountains, waterfalls, hot springs, and its charismatic megafauna—bison, wolves, elk, and grizzly bears. But it's Yellowstone's hydrothermal sites that really set it apart. Old Faithful might be the most famous of them, but it's only one of 10,000 geysers and hot springs around here. Because the park is still chilly in April, you'll have the place mostly to yourself. Only about 44,000 people visit Yellowstone in April, compared to the nearly 1 million who gather each July. If you need more incentive, entrance fees today, in honor of National Park Week, are on the house.",

There's even a name for the hue, 'robin's-egg blue.'\nAlthough it's uncommon to see these blue eggs in your backyard or in the wild (and please don't go hunting for them!), the American robin is ubiquitous throughout North America. Some migrate to Canada and Alaska, but many also remain year round in the United States and northern Mexico. This orange-breasted beauty is so popular, it's the state bird of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Connecticut.\nBut the American robin isn't the only bird that produces colored eggs. The emu (greenish-blue), great tinamou (turquoise), peregrine falcon (mottled brown), and red-winged blackbird (light blue with black spots) are only some of the other bird species that can produce eggs worthy of an Easter egg hunt!",

Square Tower House is one of many cliff dwellings constructed by the Ancestral Puebloans in what is now the American Southwest. At 27 feet, it's the tallest structure in the park. Square Tower House is also notable for its kiva, a round, sunken room used for ceremonies. Unlike most of the ancient kivas found in the region, the kiva at Square Tower House has an intact original clay roof supported by wooden beams.\nAncestral Puebloans lived in today's Four Corners region, where the borders of Colorado, Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico meet at a single point. It's unclear when exactly this culture emerged, but the current consensus is that the Ancestral Puebloans appeared in this area a little more than 3,000 years ago. They're believed to have built the series of cliff dwellings for defensive reasons as various factions competed for scarce resources when the region suffered from a prolonged drought. It's thought that the changing climate eventually became so severe that it likely drove them from the cliff dwellings sometime around 1300 CE, just a century or so after construction began. Today, many of the cliff dwellings have been restored and visitors can view the homes and kivas of the builders.",

Plitvice Lakes National Park is the oldest and largest of Croatia's national parks. The big attraction is the series of 16 descending, turquoise-colored lakes, connected by subterranean karst rivers, and above ground by streams and waterfalls. The lakes are separated by natural dams of travertine, which is created by the interplay of water, plant material, and bacteria. The water changes color from green to azure to gray depending on the angle of the light and the density of minerals and organisms in the water. About 11 miles of wooden boardwalk make it easy for people to wander among the lakes, falls, and caves that are open to visitors year-round.\nThe 115-square-mile park was established in 1949 in what is now central Croatia, near the border of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 1979, Plitvice's unique beauty put it on the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The lakes seem to magically disappear into the moss-covered earth, and then reappear downstream, proof enough that these woods are indeed enchanted.",

The young mute swans, called cygnets, are sheltered under mom's tail feathers in the Massapequa Preserve on Long Island, New York, a tranquil oasis in the suburban sprawl of Nassau County.\nMute swans, despite their name, make a variety of sounds such as grunts, snorts, and whistles but are less vocal than other species of swans. The popular phrase 'swan song' comes from the mistaken belief that swans are silent until the end of their lives, when they sing a beautiful song. Cygnets have dark bills and grey down, but as they grow older, they'll acquire snow-white feathers and an orange bill, as well as those long, looping necks swans are famous for. Male swans, or cobs, can weigh over 30 pounds, making them one of the heaviest flying birds in the world.\nTrue to their associations with love and romance, mute swans are devoted lovers. They tend to pair for life and remain monogamous, sharing duties of maintaining a nest and caring for their young. Swan pairs aggressively defend each other and even mourn dead mates. It's no wonder we've come to view them as symbols of enduring love.",

		"description": "After long—very long—winter nights, it's not surprising that the First Day of Summer is cause for a big celebration in Iceland. The public holiday falls on the first Thursday after April 18, and launches Harpa, the first summer month of the old Norse calendar that was followed by the country's first inhabitants. The year was split into just two seasons back then—summer and winter—which explains why Sumardagurinn Fyrsti, the First Day of Summer, falls in chilly April. Indeed, folklore has it that if you put a dish of water outside the night before the holiday and it freezes, you'll have a good summer. Regardless of temperature, the holiday does herald the arrival of those famously long days with little darkness, a welcome relief after the light-deprived winter months.\nSo how do Icelanders celebrate the First Day of Summer? Well, they take part in flag-waving local parades, listen to marching bands, and enjoy outdoor games and sports with family and friends. There's a tradition of giving summer gifts ('sumargjafir'), and those are often connected to outdoor activities—maybe a bike or a soccer ball, or new clothes—to encourage children to play together in the fresh air after the long, frigid winter. And of course, what celebration would be complete without food? The holiday gets people cranking up the barbecue and gathering for 'summer' food, even though the average high temperature in April is in the 40s. Getting cold watching a parade? Icelandic crepes with thick cream and jam inside will warm you up. Feeling chilly but you're determined to think 'summer'? Join the hardy Icelanders who make ice cream a First Day of Summer must-have.",

Rare plants thrive here, too, like the endangered Baltic orchid, mezereon, and daisyleaf grape fern. In addition to the draw of its biodiversity, Karula is a popular spot for camping, adventure tourism, fishing, nature photography, hiking, and cycling.\nThe very first Earth Day was on this day in 1970, when some 20 million Americans rallied in communities across the United States to raise awareness of environmental issues. The landmark event is credited for sparking passage in the 1970s of the most comprehensive environmental reform legislation in US history, including the creation of the Clean Air, Clean Water, and Endangered Species Acts, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Earth Day is now celebrated in nearly 200 countries and has grown to include Earth Week and even Earth Month celebrations. That's good news for Earth's residents, big and small.",

Unneeded artificial light is classified as a pollutant and has been proven to have harmful side effects. Not only does it waste money and energy, it also disrupts plants and animals, is believed to impact the climate, and blocks our view of the universe.\nEncouraging people to get away from artificial light is one of the goals of International Dark Sky Week, and today's photo shows just how magnificent that can be. Here, we're treated to a beautiful view of the Milky Way from Yosemite National Park in California. Yosemite is part of a network of national parks monitoring dark night skies to gather a complete data set of light pollution. A report from Yosemite National Park says that 'two-thirds of Americans cannot see the Milky Way from their backyard, and if current light pollution trends continue, there will be almost no dark skies left in the contiguous United States by 2025.'\nLuckily, dark sky is a recoverable resource. There are ways to reduce our light use and improve the view of the night sky for everyone. Think about it over the course of the next week, preferably while gazing at a night sky undisturbed by light pollution—or at least a beautiful photo of one.",

		"description": "For World Penguin Day, we're dropping in on these three kings, who are conferring on matters of state, no doubt. By their grand name, you might expect the king penguin to be the largest of penguin species. In fact, the emperor penguin outranks the king in stature, although they do look similar. The king stands out because of its striking yellow-orange chest feathers and the matching flash of color on the side of its head. Kings can be found in Antarctica and on the subantarctic islands, but their only visits to shore are during the breeding season and when it's time to molt. The 3-foot-tall kings have one of the longest breeding seasons for birds: It lasts from 14 to 15 months, and they only raise one chick every other year, as it takes nine months for the baby to be fully fledged.\nKing penguins hunt for krill, fish, and squid, while they themselves are prey for fur seals, leopard seals, and killer whales. Their hunting prowess is thanks to their large flippers, which power them to the ocean depths where dinner lurks. They can dive about 1,000 feet below the surface, where little light remains, so they rely on their excellent 'night vision' to locate prey in the darkness of the deep. That dapper tuxedo also serves an important purpose (it's not just a fashion statement): Predators looking down see the penguin's black back when he's swimming, which helps him blend in with the dark water; prey looking up from below see his white tummy, which matches the sunlight above. We'd call that a very versatile outfit.\nApril 25 is World Penguin Day, which was created to celebrate these lovable, entertaining birds and to alert people to threats facing this feathered family. Of the 18 (or so) penguin species, 12 are considered endangered or vulnerable. Among the main threats to penguins are climate change and ice melt, overfishing, and oil spills. Happily, our king friends have seen their numbers rise in recent years.",

What American movie is complete without a scene of a stroll through its unmistakable grounds?\nCentral Park was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, considered the fathers of landscape architecture. It was their first project together. They later collaborated on many large parks and college campuses all over the US, but Central Park is no doubt their most enduring work. It took 19 years to build and was completed in 1876.\nAlthough the landscape of boulders, ponds, woods, and gently sloping hills appears to be nature's original design, the land was greatly altered to create what you see today. About 5 million cubic yards of soil and rock had to be removed. Land had to be drained and leveled. More gunpowder was used to carve the land than was used in the Battle of Gettysburg during the Civil War. Nearly 150 years later, the park is still where the city plays. Residents and visitors get to enjoy two ice skating rinks, a carousel, zoo, outdoor theater, tennis courts, ballfields, formal gardens, rustic trails, and even a castle.

		"description": "At first glance, these red fox kits might look like they're just enjoying playtime in a Canadian field, but this is serious business. The kits are actually practicing crucial hunting skills. Called 'mousing,' a fox jumps high so it can surprise its prey from above. These little guys are going to get the hang of it pretty quickly, too. Baby foxes grow up very fast—they're roughly fully grown after only six or seven months. This pair is 4 months old, which is just about when their mother will get them to hunt for themselves. By autumn, when they’re around 8 to 10 months old, they'll be ready to leave their mother altogether and go off on their own.\nThere's no denying that fox hops are cute, but scientists have observed an interesting phenomenon about them. When a fox is on the hunt, regardless of the time of day, weather, or other factors that could affect how it sees its prey, a fox will almost always jump facing northeast. When it's forced to jump in another direction the hunt is rarely successful. It's believed foxes use the Earth's magnetic field to measure distance, which increases their accuracy.

It's a coast redwood, the species that includes the tallest trees on Earth. Some top out at more than 350 feet tall and live for over 2,000 years. These redwoods are heroes of nature, affecting the weather and climate, while creating conditions essential for a healthy ecosystem along this stretch of the Pacific Coast.\nBut all of this little sprout's potential is at risk because the coast redwood is an endangered species. Before commercial logging began in the mid-1800s, coast redwoods stretched across 2 million acres of the California coast—today, only 118,000 acres of older coast redwood forest remain. But they're at least protected in areas like this state park.\nWe're considering the fate of this young seedling today, because it's an especially important day for it and for all trees. That's right, today is Arbor Day, the day where we stop for a moment to think about the trees (and hopefully even plant a few). The first American Arbor Day occurred 150 years ago, when an estimated 1 million trees were planted in Nebraska in 1872. This year, America's Arbor Day Foundation is celebrating its 50th year of dedication to tree planting. They've planted over 350 million of them over the years, but the mission never ends. Trees are vital to the health of our planet, which means they're important for our own health as well.",

Lei Day was first celebrated in 1927 and made an official holiday in 1929. It also happens to fall on the first day of Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, which honors Americans of Asian, Melanesian, Micronesian, and Polynesian heritage. May is the month the first Japanese immigrants arrived in the US in 1843, and the month the transcontinental railroad was completed in 1869 by, mostly, Chinese immigrants.\nLei Day is celebrated on all the Hawaiian Islands with parades, pageants, music, dancing, and food. But at the heart of the party are leis, the garlands worn around the neck that are made with leaves, shells, and seeds, but primarily with flower blossoms. Leis are considered symbols of aloha.\nHula is also an important part of celebrating Lei Day. More than the quaint entertainment many of us have come to know, hula is a complex and ancient art form of dance and chants. Without a written language, Hawaiians used hula to record their history and culture. In this photo, a hula teacher, known as a kumu hula, leads a group of dancers against the backdrop of the rising sun, on the site of an ancient altar on the island of Molokai. It's said that hula was created by the goddess Laka on this very spot...probably on a morning that looked a lot like this one.",

		"description": "The stunning travertine terraces and hot pools of Pamukkale, Turkey, have dazzled visitors since at least the end of the 2nd century BCE, with the founding of the Greco-Roman thermal spa of Hierapolis. Since then, people have enjoyed a relaxing soak in the 97-degree Fahrenheit water, claiming curative powers for many ailments.\nIt makes sense that Pamukkale is also known as the 'Cotton Palace,' in a nod to the fluffy-looking white formations that cover the hillside. That 'cotton' is travertine, a soft limestone that is formed over centuries as calcite-laden water drops from springs in a cliff high above. Here it's a stunning white, but travertine can be found in many different colors, ranging from gray to gold.\nPamukkale, with its travertine terraces, and the ancient ruins of Hierapolis are so unique that they were named a UNESCO World Heritage Site. To protect the pools, authorities now limit the number of bathers, so you may not be allowed to take a dip. But there's plenty more to marvel at here. Walk around the ruins of the theater, necropolis, ancient temples, and bath houses in Hierapolis. You'll be in good company: The hot springs and Hierapolis draw more than 2 million visitors a year, making Pamukkale one of Turkey's most visited attractions.",

		"description": "This mandarin duck and her cute little charges seemed a fitting way to illustrate Teacher Appreciation Week, which peaks today on Teacher Appreciation Day. She is leading by example, safely guiding the next generation on their first forays into the world. Hopefully we appreciate the dedication and wisdom of our teachers year-round, but this special day is certainly a timely reminder. For the last two years educators have battled the staggering challenges of the COVID pandemic; rallying their students, whether online or distanced and masked in the classroom; and doing their best to give children a safe, nurturing environment for learning. Their commitment has helped build a strong foundation for young people's future well-being and happiness, and it taught the value of community and resilience.\nThis duck convoy is an adventure in early education too. After the chicks hatch in their nest high up in a tree cavity, the mother flies down to the ground and urges the chicks to leap out and join her (don't worry, leaves and grass protect them from the fall). Once all the chicks have made the daring plunge, the mother leads them to the water. This duck is clearly a female, as she lacks the brightly colored, showy plumage of the male—and she does have a distinctive white circle around her eye.\nDon't be surprised if it's usually a female leading the family swim—the moms are left to raise up to a dozen chicks while the dads go off to molt. While this division of the sexes may sound unfair, it's important to note that mandarin ducks are monogamous and mate for life. That's why they are symbols of love and fidelity, and carvings or illustrations of them are often given to newlyweds in China and Japan.",

That's right, today is Star Wars Day, an annual celebration every May 4 of all things 'Star Wars.' Wadi Rum, aka Valley of the Moon, in southern Jordan, stood in for the moon Jedha in 'Rogue One,' and for the planet Pasaana in 'Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.' It is easy to see why this desolate landscape was chosen to mimic an alien world.\nWadi Rum ('wadi' means 'valley' in Arabic) is the largest valley in Jordan, cut through sandstone and granite formations. A UNESCO World Heritage protected area, Wadi Rum is singled out for its ancient rock carvings and archeological remains. Various human cultures have lived in this valley since prehistoric times.\nToday, Wadi Rum is one of the most popular destinations in Jordan for tourists, particularly rock climbers and hikers. Summer temperatures routinely reach the 90s, but this being the desert, nights cool off considerably. The local Zalabieh tribe of Bedouins act as guides for tourists and coordinate activities like camel rides, horseback rides, and camping. The coastal city of Aqaba is less than 40 miles away, so if you'd like to visit Wadi Rum, put away your hyperdrive—you don't have to leave the galaxy.",

		"copyright": "© Brian Overcast/Alamy",
		"description": "Many celebrations of Cinco de Mayo owe a debt to these rolling fields of blue agave, or agave azul, the source material required to make genuine tequila. The distilled spirit is to Mexico what Scotch whisky is to Scotland and sake to Japan. Tequila is also the base ingredient in the beloved margarita cocktail certain to be served in abundance today.\nBlue agave is native to Jalisco, a coastal state of Mexico, where it grows head-high in the rich, sandy soils of Jalisco's highlands. Its flowers are pollinated, not by bees or birds, but by the Mexican long-nosed bat, adding to this succulent's mystique. The bat's favorite foods are the pollen and nectar of agave. Tequila is made by roasting the heart of the plant and then crushing or squeezing it to release a sugary, clear liquid called aguamiel, which translates to honey water. That liquid is distilled to produce tequila. Authentic tequila, by law, can be made only in Jalisco and a few municipalities outside it, and its authenticity is protected by trade agreements.\nTequila's association with Cinco de Mayo in the US probably owes to the fact that Americans observe the day with an upbeat celebration of Mexican culture in general. Cinco de Mayo is sometimes mistaken for Mexico's Independence Day, which is actually on September 16. In Mexico, Cinco de Mayo commemorates the Mexican army's victory over the French Empire in the Battle of Puebla in 1862. Whatever side of the border you're on today, if you toast the table with a glass of tequila, take a moment to remember the azure fields where it all started.",

		"description": "For just a few weeks every spring, across the pond in England and under the newly forming woodland canopy, one of the most enchanting flowers begins to bloom. The bluebell is known by many names but those who know it as the 'fairy flower' might be the most prepared to withstand its strong, sweetly scented allure. According to British folklore, a blooming bluebell carpet on the woodland floor is a mystical place where fairies live. The legends hold that fairies hang their spells on the flowers to dry, and disturbing them would unleash the magic. In earlier times, children were warned that picking bluebells would cause them to be spirited away. Even adults could fall victim to the flower, being doomed to wander the woods and never escape. And heaven forbid you ever happen to hear the fairies ring the bluebells for their gatherings—it means your death is imminent, a belief that inspired another name for bluebells: 'dead men's bells.'\nThe truth of the matter is that bluebells are considered toxic. Ancient folktales about fairies were a good way to make sure curious humans avoided handling them. But enjoying their beauty is a whole different matter. Walking through ancient woodland to catch a glimpse of these short-lived beauties is a popular activity in the United Kingdom, where they grow prolifically—today's enchanting photo was taken in Hertfordshire, England. Rare in other parts of the world, there has been success in transplanting them, should you want to want to tempt fate with the fairies.",

The first ESO telescope at the La Silla site in Chile began operating in 1966.\nAnd what better place to spend World Astronomy Day? The event was started in 1973 by Doug Berger, the president of the Astronomical Association of Northern California. His initial intent was to set up various telescopes in busy urban locations so that passersby could enjoy views of the heavens.

		"description": "Among mothers, few can claim as deep a bond with her baby as a koala mom. Because her pregnancy lasts only a month—likely making her the envy of other mammal mothers—her baby emerges into her embrace still in the embryonic stage, about the size of a jellybean. Mom will spend the next year carrying her baby, called a joey, either inside her pouch or on her back, a feat that makes her annual Mother's Day card well-earned.\nSometimes inaccurately called 'koala bears,' koalas aren't bears at all. Koalas are marsupials, and like most marsupials, they have maternal pouches. Other marsupials include kangaroos, wombats, and opossums, but the universally recognized koala might be the most photogenic of the gang. As such, the adorable creatures have become symbols of their native Australia.\nIf they always seem to be striking a relaxed pose, that's because they're sedentary tree-dwellers, inhabiting the eucalyptus forests of eastern Australia. A koala's diet consists mainly of eucalyptus leaves, which are low in calories and nutrients—that's why a koala typically spends 20 hours a day sleeping or resting. That doesn't leave time for much else but eating. Good thing koalas are asocial animals and tend to be loners. If you ever see two koalas together, they're likely mother and joey, making a koala's mother-child bond all the more special.",

These and similar rock formations are known by many names—hoodoos, tent rocks, earth pyramids, as well as fairy chimneys—and are typically found in dry, hot areas. Here in Cappadocia, in south-central Turkey, they were formed when a thick layer of volcanic ash solidified over millions of years into soft, porous rock called tuff that was overlaid by hard basalt. Cracks in the basalt allowed wind and rain to gradually wash away the softer bottom layer, leaving the hard basalt to cap tall columns of the tuff. The result is these unusual, often beautiful—and perhaps puzzling—formations that spread across the Anatolian plain.\nThis part of modern-day Turkey has been inhabited since at least the Hittite era, between 1800 and 1200 BCE, and possibly for much longer. Innumerable ancient empires fought over the region, with Hittites, Assyrians, Neo-Assyrians, Persians, Greeks, and Romans each laying claim to Anatolia at times. To escape this dangerous world, the locals learned to burrow into the hillsides for protection. Today, a visitor can see the vast, complex, interconnected caves in which societies thrived and sheltered for millennia. Göreme National Park was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1985 and is now a popular tourist destination.",

Officially, the forest was named in 1949 in honor of Pinchot, the first head of the US Forest Service. Located between Mount St. Helens to the west and Mount Adams to the east, the land was set aside as a place worth preserving as far back as 1897. But people had been living in the forest for more than 6,000 years. Archaeologists continue to make discoveries within the dense forest that teach us about the past lives of Native Americans in the Pacific Northwest.\nSpanning 1.3 million acres, GPNF exhibits an array of natural wonders: forests, wildlife, mountains, and numerous rivers and lakes that offer excellent fishing. Goose Lake is said to be the best fishing hole in the state. The forest is known as a native habitat for several threatened species, like the spotted owl, bull trout, and chinook salmon. The grounds also include the 110,000-acre Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument, established in 1982.",

That's a lot of adoring attention for a small island (only 28 square miles) of 15,000 residents, and it's no wonder why. The whitewashed, clifftop villages of Santorini, like Oia featured in this image, are postcard-perfect. And so are the unlimited panoramic views of the azure Mediterranean Sea.\nIts tranquil beauty belies the cataclysmic eruption that formed the island as we know it today. The Minoan eruption, about 3,600 years ago, was one of the world's largest known volcanic eruptions. It destroyed what was a thriving Minoan city and created a giant caldera that sank below the sea, leaving behind the picturesque lagoon seen here. Volcanic activity has continued since then. At the center of the lagoon is the uninhabited volcanic island of Nea Kameni, which emerged from the sea in 19 CE, according to Pliny the Elder. It's had several major eruptions over the past 300 years.\nWith millennia of experience, people have learned to live with the volcanic activity of these islands. Tourism is now the main activity on Santorini, along with a small winemaking industry. Throw in abundant sunshine, constant sea breezes, and meandering steps through storybook villages and you'll never run out of reasons to visit.",

The preserve was established in 1961 and is contiguous with the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania—together, the Mara-Serengeti ecosystem protects some 9,700 square miles. In addition to our friend the giraffe, the Maasai Mara is home to large populations of elephants, lions, cheetahs, rhinos, wildebeest, hippos, crocodiles, zebras, and many more creatures.\nWhile some zoologists consider the Masai giraffe its own species, most authorities recognize just one species of giraffe with nine subspecies. Masai giraffes like this one are the tallest of those, with males reaching heights of more than 18 feet. They range from southern Kenya, south through the Serengeti, and through all of Tanzania. In 2019, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) announced that Masai giraffes are now endangered. Their population has declined by nearly 50% in the last 30 years, mostly because of poaching and changes in land use.\nUntil the late 19th century, giraffes were commonly known as camelopards, due to the mistaken belief that a giraffe was a cross between a camel and leopard. But if you've ever tried to get a camel and a leopard to even go on a first date, you'd know how unlikely this is.",

		"description": "If you're lucky enough to find yourself under a cloudless sky tonight, you'll be able to see one of our solar system's great wonders, a full lunar eclipse, also known as a 'blood moon.' The spooky nickname derives from the reddish hue the moon takes on when Earth casts its shadow upon it. Featured here is a blood moon over the Swiss Alps. A full lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth and moon align perfectly with the sun, and the moon falls directly behind Earth's shadow. When Earth falls behind the moon's shadow, a solar eclipse occurs.\nWhile total eclipses of the sun get more attention and make a more dramatic entrance, total lunar eclipses are majestic in their own right and are much more user-friendly. For one, you can look directly at a total lunar eclipse without any worry of harming your eyes. And they're viewable by far more people than solar eclipses. That's because a total lunar eclipse can last for hours, while solar eclipses last just a few minutes. In addition, lunar eclipses are viewable anywhere on the nighttime side of the world while total solar eclipses occur only within a narrow longitude on the planet.\nTonight's lunar eclipse coincides with the 'flower moon,' the full moon of every May. Earth's shadow will gradually begin moving across the face of the moon beginning at 10:28 PM Eastern time. The moon will be in Earth's full shadow for about 85 minutes, with the peak of the eclipse occurring just after midnight, at 12:11 AM Eastern time. It can be seen from Europe, Africa, and parts of Asia, but is best viewed from North and South America. While not exactly rare, total lunar eclipses don't occur too often, and even when they do, they can be hidden by cloud cover. If you miss tonight's blood moon, you'll get a second chance this year in November. Your next chance after that will be in three years, so you might want to plan to stay up late tonight.",

They're also one of the smallest owl species, measuring 9 or 10 inches and weighing less than a half-pound.\nAnd unlike other birds, their method of warding off predators is to make rattling and hissing sounds, as if they were rattlesnakes. Moreover, these owls are most active during the daytime, not snoozing when the sun is up as other owls do.\nThe burrowing owl has many neighbors here in the Pawnee National Grassland. This internationally known birding area is home to the Colorado state bird, the lark bunting, as well as the mountain plover and several birds of prey.

You'll find more than 6,000 of the little salt pans near Maras, many of them owned and mined by local families.\nSalt is still harvested from the ponds through evaporation, just as it was in the 1400s when the Inca created the pools. Production is—pun sort of intended—seasonal. From May to October output is greater and of higher quality, and you'll see crystallized salt with its subtle pink hue. Maras salt is prized for its flavor and rough texture, and people swear by its healthy properties, too. The salt is sold in markets, and of course visitors are encouraged to take samples back home with them.\nIt's not far from Maras to Moray, another location where Incan ingenuity is on display. This time it's in the form of grass-covered stone rings believed to have been test beds for crop experimentation. The soil is from a few areas in the region, and studies show that the rings were designed to create microclimates to see what worked best for different plants.",

This relatively small wonder proves that inspiration can be found in many places, including a suburb of Kansas City. At 42,000 square feet, the Museum at Prairiefire in Overland Park, Kansas, is about 1/50th the size of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, with which it has a partnership. But to those who find beauty and truth behind its walls, Prairiefire is no less enriching.\nInternational Museum Day was created by the International Council of Museums in 1977 to create awareness that 'museums are an important means of cultural exchange, enrichment of cultures and development of mutual understanding, cooperation and peace among peoples.' It's observed annually on or around May 18 by more than 37,000 museums in 158 countries and territories. Each year is assigned a different theme. This year's theme is 'The Power of Museums,' to innovate and build community.\nThe Museum at Prairiefire, which opened in May 2014, is devoted primarily to natural history. It borrows displays from larger museums and hosts at least two major traveling exhibits per year. Its striking glass exterior, featured here, was designed to reference the intentional prairie fires that were an integral part of farming life in Kansas. The glass is dichroic, which means that its color changes with the light of the day. The museum is itself a work of art.",

When 80,000 visitors showed up each day after it opened, authorities needed some time to reevaluate what exactly they had. Parking, ticketing, and customer service were boosted before the bridge reopened.\nDesigned by Israeli architect Haim Dotan, it was always meant for tourists. Spanning 1,410 feet across the canyon between two mountain cliffs in Zhangjiajie National Forest Park, more than 120 glass panels allow unparalleled views 980 feet straight down. Should you feel daring, you could swing underneath the bridge or take the plunge from the world's highest bungee jump. Management touts that the bridge set 10 world records for design and construction, and when it opened it was the longest bridge of its kind in the world. That honor has since passed to the bridge at the Huangchuan Three Gorges Scenic Area in China's Guangdong province, which spans 1,726 feet.",

		"description": "It's World Bee Day, and we're doffing our caps in thanks to the world's lesser known 'essential workers.' According to the UN, three out of four crops across the globe producing fruits or seeds for use as human food depend, at least in part, on bees and other pollinators. And tens of thousands of flowering plants, like the crocuses in today's photo, would not exist if it weren't for the little buzzers. A quote often misattributed to Albert Einstein suggests humans would have only four years left to live if the bees go extinct. No matter who said it, the message is clear: Our livelihood is intimately tied to the survival of bees. And that connection is of critical importance now, as bee colonies continue to struggle after more than 20 years of mass die-offs, a phenomenon known as colony collapse disorder.\nThe good thing is that many people are actively working to reverse this trend. The hobby of beekeeping has skyrocketed in recent years, even in urban areas. Bees suffer in some rural agricultural areas where the wildflowers they depend on have largely disappeared due to monoculture farming practices. Excessive pesticide use on farms is also harming bee populations. So, ironically perhaps, urban areas have greater plant diversity and lower pesticide levels, which makes cities often better habitats for beekeeping. 'City bees' are now said to be healthier and produce better honey than bees raised in farming areas.\nIn Slovenia, the country responsible for the World Bee Day initiative, beekeeping is a way of life. One out of every 200 people is a beekeeper, most of them amateurs. The Beekeeping Academy of Slovenia says the hobby teaches 'responsibility, perseverance, modesty, hard work, love of nature and homeland.' Plus, they get that honey. Now that's something to buzz about.",

		"description": "The winds of history have long blown through the beautiful halls of the Alhambra. Though it had been the location of fortresses as far back as the 800s, construction of the Alhambra (Arabic for 'red castle') began in 1238 under the rule of Muhammad I Ibn al-Ahmar, founder of the Emirate of Granada. Ensuing leaders would continue construction of the complex, turning it into one of the finest examples of architecture from the historic Islamic world. The palace was the final hold of the Moors before the completion of the Christian Reconquista in 1492, when the Alhambra became the royal court of Ferdinand and Isabella. They greeted Christopher Columbus there later that same year.\nWhile Spanish rulers would soon leave their imprint on the complex, with Spanish Renaissance architecture standing in contrast to the existing structures, the next few centuries would see the Alhambra gradually fall into disrepair and disuse, including a damaging occupation by Napoleon's forces during the Peninsular War of 1807-1814. After Napoleon's defeat, the grand palace was rediscovered among European and American travelers, which led to several extensive restorations. In 1984 the Alhambra was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Today it's one of Spain's most-visited tourist destinations.",

		"description": "Today we're taking a walk through the clouds to visit one of the most beautiful and biodiverse places on the planet. Costa Rica's Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve is in the Tilarán mountain range 5,000 feet above sea level. Hundreds of animal species and thousands of insect and plant species call the forest home. Diligent nature lovers could count nearly 700 types of butterflies and 500 species of orchids during a visit. Famous in the scientific community, the forest also attracts more than 70,000 tourists a year.\nYou may be wondering, what exactly is a 'cloud forest?' Different than a rainforest, a cloud forest is high enough above sea level to be covered by persistent mist and fog generated by the forest's own evaporating moisture. This makes for a damp and humid, yet cool environment. Generally tropical, cloud forests are pretty rare. Only 1% of the current global woodland is considered true cloud forest. Entirely dependent on an area's local climate, it is expected that many of the 736 locations currently identified as cloud forests will be strongly impacted and altered in the coming years. Monteverde, in fact, is known as the location where the first climate-related species extinction was recorded—in the 1980s, the golden toad fell victim to a parasitic fungus that spread into the area due to the changing climate.",

		"description": "Few structures achieve the status of the Golden Gate Bridge—so recognizable that it needs no introduction. Opened on this day in 1937, the bridge was a marvel of engineering, built to withstand ferocious winds above and swirling currents below. Its construction was embraced by the local population because it would finally connect the rising metropolis of San Francisco to communities in Marin County and all that lay north. Before the bridge was completed, a ferry was the only way across the Golden Gate, the mile-wide strait that connects the Pacific Ocean to San Francisco Bay. Building a bridge to cross the span would be no small feat, and many thought it impossible.\nFinancing for the construction was another hurdle and was put further at risk with the Great Crash of 1929. But eventually voters in the Bay Area supported a bond measure worth $35 million ($530 million in 2020 dollars), using their homes, farms, and business properties as collateral—the infusion of cash allowed construction to begin in 1933. In the midst of the Great Depression, the bridge became a jobs generator, putting 2,000 men to work. In four years they completed the engineering triumph ahead of schedule and under budget.\nIts two towers rise to 746 feet above the water, and the span suspended between them is 4,200 feet long, which made it the longest suspension bridge in the world upon its completion. Eighteen longer suspension bridges have since been built (nine of them in China), but the Golden Gate remains the star among them, considered the most beautiful, the most photographed, a symbol of American style and ingenuity, and a calling card for a city. There are few better reasons to leave your heart in San Francisco.",

To the west, toward the setting sun, is the Reflecting Pool and the Lincoln Memorial. To the east, unseen here, is the Washington Monument.\nThe World War II Memorial is steeped in meaning and tells the story of the armed conflicts in both the Atlantic and Pacific. On the north side of the oval fountain and plaza, images cast in bronze tell the story of the battle against the Axis powers in Europe. Other bronze bas-reliefs on the south of the fountain depict the battle for the Pacific. The images also draw a link between the battlefront and the home front with images of troops in Europe and the Pacific interspersed with those of farmers and factory workers in the US. Statements made by leaders of the time are etched onto the walls of the memorial, as are names of famous battles.\nAt opposite ends of the fountain are 56 pillars arranged in two semicircles, representing the 48 states and six US territories (at the time of the war). But perhaps the most poignant feature of the memorial is the field of gold stars, in the center of today's photo, as you look west toward the Lincoln Memorial. Each of the 4,048 stars represents 100 Americans who died in the war. Below the field of stars are inscribed the words, \"HERE WE MARK THE PRICE OF FREEDOM.\"",

These long-lived, charismatic, intelligent, loyal, and affectionate creatures are threatened by habitat loss, competition from invasive species, and trapping for the pet trade. Indeed, the qualities that make them darlings of the animal world also make them attractive as pets for people.\nThere are nearly 400 species of parrots, divided into three superfamilies: true parrots, cockatoos, and New Zealand parrots. Most live in tropical or subtropical regions. A quarter to a third of all wild parrot species are threatened with extinction. As many as 50 million parrots live in captivity, where they can live as long as humans. Along with crows, ravens, and magpies, parrots are among the most intelligent birds and are well known for being able to mimic human speech.\nThe scarlet macaw, pictured here in flight in Costa Rica, is found from southern Mexico to Bolivia. It has disappeared from some places because of habitat destruction or capture for the parrot trade, but in other areas it remains widespread. Prized for their bright colors, macaws have been bred by people for centuries. They are among the largest of parrot species, growing to almost 3 feet long, mostly because of their tail feathers, a trademark of the scarlet macaw. They prefer to live in tall deciduous trees and near rivers. They tend to mate for life and share in the duties of caring for their young, taking turns preening their chicks and each other in an impressive display of affection.",

The beauty and diversity of species contained within its pristine 270 square miles are the perfect inspiration for World Reef Day, observed every year on June 1 to bring awareness to this vital but largely unseen part of our natural world. Reef Day also kicks off World Oceans Month, a time to celebrate and learn more about these indispensable ecosystems.\nAlthough coral reefs occupy less than 0.1% of the planet's oceans, they support up to 25% of the world's marine species. They have rightfully earned their nickname, 'Rainforests of the Sea.' Coral is not a plant, but part animal and part mineral, a marine invertebrate that secretes calcium carbonate to form a hard skeleton. They grow in colonies, usually in warm, shallow waters, and form vast colonies that we see as reefs, creating the basic platform for marine life to flourish around them. They even provide benefits to land, protecting shorelines from the forces of the ocean.\nUnfortunately, coral reefs are under immense environmental pressure due to pollution, overfishing, and particularly from changing ocean temperatures. A warming ocean and acidification due to increased carbon dioxide have resulted in coral bleaching—when under stress, corals lose their color. The yellow whip and red gorgonian you see here are what healthy coral look like, but vibrant, hearty coral are swiftly becoming the exception rather than the rule. Recently, even the previously robust and thriving Marovo Lagoon began showing signs of bleaching, a sobering reminder that the beauty we see here is fragile and becoming more precious.",

Of course, the Trooping of the Colour will take center stage today as the official birthday parade, with 1,400 soldiers in full military regalia, 200 horses, and 400 military band musicians. The royal family will watch the parade and then turn their gaze to the skies as the Royal Air Force flies past. The rest of the jubilee week will include a service of thanksgiving at St. Paul's Cathedral in London, a live concert here at Buckingham Palace, and a special pageant featuring people from throughout Britain.\nBeacons will be lighted the length of the land, and we suspect many will celebrate by sampling the newly anointed official jubilee pudding, a lemon trifle that won a nationwide baking contest to discover a new dessert fit for the queen. Another delicious way to celebrate the jubilee is with the Big Lunch. The idea took off in 2009 and is now a beloved annual tradition. Communities get together to celebrate and enjoy themselves, sharing food and friendship in gatherings large and small. The lunch can be a neighborhood barbecue or a street party—or even an impromptu wine-and-cheese affair, with people sitting on folding chairs in someone's driveway.

The German inventor would likely be floored by today's variety of bike options, from lightweight road bikes to heavier mountain bikes with fat, knobby tires designed to handle rougher terrain and even snow.

Thankfully the trails in the national network are categorized as 'Scenic,' 'Historic,' or 'Recreational' to simplify things. Probably the most famous pathways are the Appalachian Trail and the Pacific Crest Trail (both designated 'Scenic' trails), which were the first to be officially named to the National Trails System when President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the system into law in 1968.\nIn a speech three years earlier, Johnson had said, 'We can and should have an abundance of trails for walking, cycling, and horseback riding, in and close to our cities. In the backcountry we need to copy the great Appalachian Trail in all parts of America.' His vision took root, and today there are protected trails across the US, with much of their upkeep carried out by enthusiastic volunteers. If you need an incentive to hit the great outdoors, we reckon this image should do the trick. Banner Peak and Thousand Island Lake in the Ansel Adams Wilderness are highlights along both the Pacific Crest Trail and the John Muir Trail.\nToday is National Trails Day, established by the American Hiking Society as a day of public events aimed at advocacy and trail service. On this day, 'Thousands of hikers, bikers, rowers, horseback riders, trail clubs, federal and local agencies, land trusts, and businesses come together in partnership to advocate for, maintain, and clean up public lands and trails,' the AHS explains.

Started in 1975 as a research location for the University of Helsinki, the plan was to create rhododendron plants that would thrive in Finland's northern climate. And, boy, did they. Around 3,000 specimens of a Japanese variety of rhododendron were originally planted, then selectively bred to produce eight new varieties of 'rhodies' over the years.\nIn 1996, the park was expanded to include azalea plants, which are also in the rhododendron family and bloom at the same time. The research garden now doubles as a public park that is visited by thousands of locals and tourists every summer. Since the gardens were originally planted, it's been observed that the blooms fluctuate. A vibrant year is usually followed by a more modest one. So, if you're 'rhodo-loco' and planning on making the trip to check it out, try to time it right.",

		"description": "On World Oceans Day, you're invited to dinner below the sea, hosted by these long-beaked common dolphins. This pod, off the Eastern Cape in South Africa, is employing an ingenious hunting technique, herding a school of frantic sardines toward the surface of the water so they have no escape, essentially driving them against a wall. Once pinned near the surface, the sardines are easy pickings for the hungry dolphins and any other lucky bystanders, like these dive-bombing Cape gannets who are quick to pounce on the opportunity. The technique requires teamwork of course but that comes easy to dolphins, known for their intelligence and tight familial bonds.\nWorld Oceans Day has been officially recognized by the UN since 2008, in an effort to create awareness and understanding of the oceans and their vital role in supporting all life on the planet, not just marine life. The oceans are under pressure like never before from pollution and climate change. As habitats become dangerously altered, many species are facing extinction, signs that the vast oceans are more fragile than we once thought.\nLest we ignore the bit players here, the smallest fish, like anchovies, herring, and these sardines, fill an essential role in the food chain. Mass feedings like this occur all over the oceans. Scientists even have a name for it: multi-species feeding associations. One massive shoal of small fish can feed many larger creatures, demonstrating how life in the sea is interconnected and how every organism has a part to play.",

We're in a Scottish village now known as New Abbey, about 8 miles south of Dumfries. We've stepped inside the ruins of Sweetheart Abbey, a 13th-century testament to the love between a husband and wife. Founded in 1273 by 'lady of substance' Dervorguilla of Galloway, the abbey was constructed solely to commemorate her love for English nobleman John de Balliol upon his death in 1268.\nHer devotion didn't end there, though. It's said she had his heart embalmed and placed in an ivory casket bound with silver. She then carried it with her everywhere she traveled for the rest of her life. Dervorguilla and the heart were eventually laid to rest alongside John at the abbey when she passed in 1290. As time progressed, sadly, the lovers' graves were lost to war.",

This picturesque area, located in the Hodonín District near the town of Kyjov, is a haven for photographers. Moravia has a rich history, and the long-settled region has been a part of numerous empires. Medieval and Ottoman castles are among the historic highlights for visitors to take in.\nAside from Moravia's highly regarded wines, the region produces a vast amount of poppy seeds in fields like this one. Most of the crop is exported, but the tiny black seeds have long had a prominent place in Czech cuisine, particularly in pastries. Poppies have also been revered since ancient times for their beauty and medicinal qualities. The Greeks and Romans used them as offerings to the dead. Poppies on tombstones represented eternal sleep, a symbology L. Frank Baum tapped into when the characters in 'The Wonderful Wizard of Oz' begin to fall asleep in a poppy field. The poem 'In Flanders Fields,' with its reference to red poppies growing on the graves of fallen soldiers, is the reason the flower is associated today with Memorial Day (aka Remembrance Day).",

		"description": "You may think finding a tropical paradise that's still largely untouched by people is merely a pipe dream. You may be wrong. Raja Ampat, an archipelago in the province of West Papua, Indonesia, has a mere 64,000 inhabitants, and they all live on or around its four main islands—Batanta, Misool, Salawati, and Waigeo. (In fact, the name Raja Ampat means 'Four Kings' and derives from an ancient legend that says four young kings were hatched from dragon eggs, one ruler for each of those main islands.) The rest of Raja Ampat is made up of about 1,500 smaller islands and cays—and astonishingly, hundreds of these tiny islands have yet to be explored by humans.\nOf course, the lack of people is critical to keeping this paradise pristine. The main visitors today tend to be adventurous divers and snorkelers, who love exploring Raja Ampat and its vast reef system. And for good reason: It's considered one of the most biodiverse places in the world. The ecosystem, which is part of a larger tropical ocean area called the Coral Triangle, is so diverse that it's sometimes referred to as the Amazon of the Seas. Raja Ampat stretches over nearly 10 million acres of land and sea, and it boasts 540 types of coral, more than 1,000 species of coral reef fish, 700 kinds of mollusks, and a variety of warm-blooded marine animals (including migratory snorkelers and scuba divers).",

		"description": "Join us for a hike at one of America's least-visited national parks. Big Bend National Park may be among the country's largest national parks with an area of over 800,000 acres (about the size of Rhode Island), but it's also one of the most remote. Found in West Texas along the Rio Grande at the Mexico border, the park entrance is roughly a two-hour drive from the nearest interstate. The good thing is, even in a 'busy' year when half a million people visit, there's plenty of space to enjoy the great outdoors unhindered by crowds.\nAdded to the national park system on this day in 1944, Big Bend contains the largest protected area of the Chihuahuan Desert in the United States. It's also known for having the darkest night skies among the contiguous states. This makes it a 'must visit' for stargazing; thousands of stars are visible when the skies are clear, along with the Milky Way. If you head out for a hike, keep your eyes peeled for the 1,200 plant species in the park. There are also plenty of animals, though most of them tend to come out only at night. Except birds, that is. Birdwatching is incredibly popular at Big Bend–it's on the paths of annual migrations, so more than 450 different bird species have been cataloged here.",

		"description": "At a glance, this might look like some ordinary swamp, but the Okavango Delta in the African nation of Botswana is a veritable miracle of nature. Unlike most rivers, the Okavango River doesn't drain into any sea or ocean, but rather empties into the open savanna. Thousands of elephants, and just about every other type of African animal you can name, owe their existence to this annual wetland. 'Annual,' because the marshland of the delta swells threefold to its full size but once a year, between March and July, when the seasonal rains from the highlands of Angola flow downhill 750 miles until they flood the arid savanna of northwest Botswana. The wildlife drawn to this life-sustaining water includes lions, leopards, cheetahs, rhinos, giraffes, zebras, hippos, wildebeests, hyenas, crocodiles, impalas, and of course elephants, the planet's largest land animals.\nBy far, most of the world's elephants—more than 400,000—live in Africa, and Botswana is the country with the largest population of African elephants. The majority are bush elephants, larger than their cousins, the African forest elephants who live in the Congo Basin. Bush elephants have concave backs and their tusks curve outward, while forest elephants have straight backs and tusks. Both are endangered by habitat loss and poaching. Their population is about a tenth of what it was at its peak in the last century.\nMoremi Game Reserve makes up a large portion of the delta. The rest is protected by a mosaic of other preserves called Wildlife Management Areas. In 2014, the Okavango Delta was placed on the UNESCO World Heritage List. The amount of water that fills the delta is estimated to be 2.6 cubic miles, four to five times the volume of water contained in Lake Okeechobee in Florida. Eventually much of this water will be consumed, absorbed, and evaporated, and the delta will once again more closely resemble the savanna around it. Until the next rains come.",

The Met anchors Museum Mile, a stretch of Fifth Avenue on Manhattan's Upper East Side that is home to eight museums. Of these, the Met is the biggest, followed by the Guggenheim. All reside within 22 blocks of one another. Today, the city celebrates these curatorial treasures with the Museum Mile Festival, as museums extend their hours and offer free admission to all visitors. Billed as a mile-long celebration of art and culture, the festival also includes outdoor performances along Fifth Avenue.\nThe Met was founded in 1870 and backs up to the eastern perimeter of Central Park. Its encyclopedic collection includes art from every part of the world, from classical antiquities to modern art, musical instruments, weaponry, and clothing. The vast museum even displays an Egyptian temple, the Temple of Dendur, which Egypt dismantled and gave to the US in 1965—President Lyndon Johnson awarded it to the Met two years later. The Met is also famous for hosting the Costume Institute Gala, better known as the Met Gala, on the first Monday of May. The gala is organized by Vogue magazine and draws celebrities from many fields.\nBut you don't have to be an A-lister to enjoy Museum Mile today. If your jam is the Met, El Museo del Barrio, the Jewish Museum, or the Cooper Hewitt, you don't want to miss this massive block party.",

		"description": "If you're celebrating Nature Photography Day today, then Great Smoky Mountains National Park would be an excellent place to snap your own shots of sylvan splendor like this one. That's because you'd have two reasons to celebrate—the park turns 88 today. These misty peaks and valleys along the border between Tennessee and North Carolina were established as a national park on this day in 1934. All these years later, it may not be the most famous national park in the US, but it is by far the most popular. With more than 14 million visitors per year, it draws more people than the Grand Canyon, Yellowstone, and Yosemite combined.\nTrue to its name, the park is known for its persistent haze. Native Americans–the region is the ancestral home of the Cherokee people–gave the place a name that translates to 'place of the blue smoke.' The smoke is actually a fog created in part by the native vegetation. It owes its blueish appearance to humidity and stagnant air. Almost all of the park is covered in deciduous and coniferous forest, a third of it old-growth trees that predate European settlement. The thick forests, range of elevations, and abundant rainfall support a stunning variety of wildlife. There are so many black bears that about two live in every square mile of the park. Bats, foxes, skunks, otters, bobcats, and 200 species of birds also call this place home. The park is most notable for its salamanders. In fact, it's known as the Salamander Capital of the World, with 30 species living here.\nBut the real stars of the park are the mountains. For panoramic vistas, this vantage point—Clingmans Dome on the Tennessee side of the park—is hard to beat. At 6,643 feet, it's also the highest point in the state. To take your own version of this shot, you don't even have to hike. Simply drive to the parking lot. But after you've got your pics, keep the camera handy. If the parking lot looks this good, imagine what photos you can take in the rest of the park.",

		"description": "The Seonam Temple, or Seonamsa, in Jogyesan Provincial Park, South Korea, is famed for expressing calm serenity. Just downstream, Buddhist monks built this gently arched bridge by hand centuries ago. Stones around the base record the names of visitors for posterity. Called the Seungseon Bridge ('the Ascending Immortals'), it's fitting to approach the temple itself on foot, at one with nature. The site is hidden away in ancient trees, with tranquil ponds and streams, gentle hiking trails, and gorgeous pagodas. The temple still ekes out its day in the traditional way, with mellow bells and meditation. The monks also cultivate wild tea plants and are happy to share the benefits of the harvest. You are at peace as soon as you arrive at Seonamsa, and there's little to distract you from the present moment.\nThe original temple is believed to have been built in the 9th century, but over the years war and a major fire caused extensive damage, and it had to be rebuilt in the 19th century. Now the Seonam Temple is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, along with six other 'sansa,' or Buddhist monasteries, dotted in the mountains throughout the southern provinces of the Korean Peninsula. Visitors are invited to stay overnight at the temple and follow the monks' daily practice, but you can also dip in for a day to absorb the peace and tranquility. Flowers in spring and colorful leaf displays in fall make those the most popular times to visit.",

The region's harsh weather means that only the hardiest of wildflowers can survive, and the bright yellow arrowleaves fit the bill.

Those two magnificent parks, along with several surrounding national forests and wildlife refuges, together help constitute the almost 18-million-acre (28,000-square-mile) Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, one of the world's largest intact mid-latitude temperate ecosystems.\nHere at Grand Teton National Park, there's something for every lover of the outdoors. It's a popular destination for mountaineering, hiking, fishing, and camping, with more than 1,000 drive-in campsites and over 200 miles of hiking trails that provide access to the backcountry.

		"description": "Of all the tricks humans have taught themselves, few delight and impress more than surfing. A sport, a pastime, an art, a philosophy of life, surfing is as close to magic as a person can perform on the untamed ocean. Today, the sport of wave riding gets its well-earned due with International Surfing Day, a time each year to honor the sport, the lifestyle of surfing, and the ocean itself, whose good health is vital to the sport and so much else. Surfers have a special connection to the ocean and the waves it produces. A surfable wave is shaped by countless variables: The winds hundreds or thousands of miles away that produced the energy to set the swells in motion, and then the reef or point of land or underwater boulder upon which a swell will break into a perfectly shaped wave. Wind and timing are everything, and devoted surfers know the weather and the shore intimately.\nSurfing can be done anywhere waves break, from Iceland to Ireland, Brazil to Senegal. But there are a handful of spots renowned for their waves, such as Hawaii, Tahiti, California, and the Gold Coast in Queensland, Australia, pictured here. As the sport has evolved, surfers have taken on ever bigger waves, giants that exceed 50 feet in height at now-famous surf breaks like Jaws, Mavericks, and the latest in Nazare, Portugal.\nSurfing is believed to have originated in Polynesia more than 1,500 years ago and was observed by Westerners in Hawaii as early as the 1700s. Native Hawaiians are credited for creating the sport as we know it today. Duke Kahanamoku, Olympic swimmer, great waterman, and one of Hawaii's earliest celebrities, helped spread surfing's popularity to California and Australia in the early 1900s. Today, surfing is an Olympic sport, has a professional tour for both men and women, and is an integral part of popular culture. But for the lucky souls who know how to ride a wave, it's simply the best way to spend a day at the beach.",

		"description": "Happy Father's Day! To celebrate, we're venturing into a tropical forest in Queensland, Australia, to visit one of nature's most protective fathers, the southern cassowary, the largest of three species of this flightless bird. The cassowary has earned the title of the 'world's most dangerous bird' because of its sharp, dagger-like claws and aggressive behavior. Cassowaries, like this doting father and his chicks, are notorious for attacking and sometimes killing domestic animals and even humans. In the wild, adult birds are so belligerent that they have no natural predators. Their young, however, need some protection. That's when dad steps in.\nOnce a mother cassowary lays eggs, she essentially abandons the family and moves on to start another. Cassowaries are solitary birds, so this abandonment of the chicks comes naturally. But dad understands his children need some assistance. He'll sit on the eggs for upwards of 50 days, making sure to add or remove nesting material to keep their home at the perfect temperature. During this time, he's so attuned to keeping the eggs safe, he often skips meals. Upon hatching, chicks can stay in the nest for nine months. Dad stays by their side the whole time, often taking them out to feed and to teach them the ways of the world.\nSnakes, lizards, and eagles that try to capture a cassowary chick are often met by extremely aggressive kicks with those claws that can eviscerate the would-be attacker. Once the chicks come of age, papa cassowary chases them away and gets ready to do it all again with another brood. While there are no reports of his kids returning to deliver 'World's Greatest Dad' mugs or ashtrays, the male cassowary's dedication to fatherhood has earned our admiration.",

The gorgeous swallowtail is welcome in any garden, both for its beauty and its ability to pass pollen from flower to flower. Far less desired are swallowtails in their caterpillar form, which can take a toll on ornamental plants or citrus crops. There are more than 550 swallowtail butterfly species, and their name comes from the forked appearance of their hindwings, which can be seen when the butterfly is resting with its wings spread.\nAbout three-quarters of all flowering plant species need the help of animals to move their heavy pollen grains from plant to plant for fertilization. While bees and butterflies are famously prolific pollinators, they're far from the only creatures to serve this vital function. Other insect pollinators include wasps, ants, flies, moths, and flower beetles. Vertebrates can pollinate certain plants, too: mainly bats and birds, but also some non-bat mammals (monkeys, lemurs, possums, rodents) and some lizards. Long-beaked birds such as hummingbirds, honeyeaters, and sunbirds pollinate deep-throated flowers.\nPollinating animals are our unheralded heroes, traveling from plant to plant carrying pollen on their bodies in an interaction that allows the transfer of genetic material critical to the reproductive system of most flowering plants. These plants provide us with food and innumerable resources. Without hardworking pollinators, humans would soon be an endangered species.",

Spend the longest day of the year exploring the town, which is swaddled in myth and history. Pagans and Christians alike have worshipped here through the ages, and both groups still do today. Glastonbury Tor is the striking hill on the horizon, and the lonely tower is the last vestige of the 14th-century church of St Michael, which was built to replace a wooden church toppled by an earthquake in 1275.\nAdventurous visitors may be intrigued by the legend that suggests you can access the fairy kingdom of Annwn through a secret cave below the tor. (Pay a social call on the lord of the Celtic underworld, Gwyn ap Nudd, while you're there). Another legend tells of a visit by the boy Jesus with his uncle, Joseph of Arimathea, and how they left the Holy Grail in Glastonbury. And there's a tale that the town is the site of the mythical Isle of Avalon, where King Arthur went after his final battle. (As far as we know, the Holy Grail has not been found, but in 1191 monks in the community at Glastonbury Abbey announced that they had found Arthur's grave.)\nRegardless of your own beliefs, historical or spiritual, there's no disputing it—celebrating the summer solstice on Glastonbury Tor is a memorable quest. Be warned, though: You won't be alone. The event draws crowds of people, some hoping to tap into the spiritual aura, others who want to start at the tor and work their way to Glastonbury Abbey and the Chalice Well and Gardens. Still others will head from here to the Glastonbury Festival, the massive five-day festival of music and other performing arts that begins in nearby Pilton tomorrow. The summer solstice has been celebrated in different ways in many different cultures for centuries, so feel free to usher in summer however you want, bidding adieu to the dark and cold and welcoming warmer, sunnier days.",

The Amazon spans nine countries in South America including Ecuador, where this pristine ecoregion is protected by the Yasuní National Park, shown here. Today is set aside as World Rainforest Day, to remember the vital role of this and other rainforests and to champion efforts to protect them. The world's rainforests are under threat like never before from deforestation driven by agriculture and cattle ranching. Some studies indicate that humans have degraded or destroyed more than half of the world's rainforests. Fewer trees means warmer temperatures, which increases the risk of drought and wildfire and compounds the damage of deforestation.\nThe Amazon has been called the lungs of the planet because the estimated 390 billion trees here convert carbon dioxide into oxygen, which humans and other animals need to survive. The Amazon also cools our planet by capturing and storing carbon. It is as much the planet's air conditioner as it is its lungs. For that reason, the health of rainforests is crucial to arresting climate change.\nThe other gift of rainforests, and of the Amazon in particular, is biodiversity. The number of species of plants, animals, and insects in the Amazon is not in the thousands, but in the millions. Scientists estimate half of the planet's biodiversity exists in the Amazon. In fact, many of our modern pharmaceuticals are derived from Amazon plants. That makes the Amazon not just the Earth's lungs and air conditioning, but also its medicine cabinet.",

		"description": "For 427 years the Mostar Bridge stood strong, despite the belief that its original mortar was composed of egg whites. Truth is, not much is known about the 16th-century construction of this bridge in what is now known as Bosnia and Herzegovina. All that remains in historical records are memories and legends and the name of the bridge's builder, Mimar Hayruddin. He was charged by Suleiman the Magnificent to build an unprecedentedly wide arch, and threatened with death if the structure failed. Hayruddin is said to have been so unsure of his creation that he made funeral preparations before the scaffolding was removed.\nLuckily (and much to the builder's probable relief), the arch remained intact. Suspended nearly 80 feet above the Neretva River, the highest point of the bridge's arch rose an additional 39.5 feet. Upon its completion in 1566, it was the widest arch ever built, stretching 90 feet across. The bridge was compared by one explorer to 'a rainbow arch soaring up to the skies.'\nKnown locally as Stari Most, or 'Old Bridge,' it was finally brought down in November 1993 after being hit by a barrage of shells in a targeted attack during the Bosnian War. Considered a treasure of Bosnian Islamic architecture, its destruction by Croatian forces was condemned around the world. Scholars referred to the act as an attempt at 'killing memory.' Due to the cultural significance of the bridge in the Mostar region, plans to rebuild it as accurately as possible began at the war's end. The reconstructed bridge was unveiled to the public in 2004. Used for normal daily activities, the bridge also has history as a popular spot for annual diving competitions.",

		"description": "Like a giant block of Swiss cheese, Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula is riddled with holes called cenotes. Cenotes form when subterranean limestone dissolves, allowing underground water to penetrate. The rock above may cave in, forming a sinkhole that reveals the cool, often crystal-clear water. Other cenotes may remain below the surface, hidden and often unexplored. Cenotes vary in size from very small to several dozen yards across, and recent discoveries have shown that some cenotes lead to a series of underground cave systems that can span several miles in length.\nIn a region with little rainfall and no aboveground rivers or streams, the Yucatán's thousands of cenotes were vital to the many cities of the Maya civilization that used them as a primary source of fresh water. While some of the peninsula's cenotes have a mix of salt water and fresh water, many of the holes have remarkably clean fresh water that has slowly filtered through rock. The diffuse light that reaches into the underground chambers creates a magical effect that only enhances the fantastic swimming and diving. Many of the larger cenotes feature platforms and ropes to jump off, and they are often located near historically significant Maya ruins.",

		"description": "Summer up north belongs to the bears. When the sun reigns, so do the brown bears of Alaska—like this mother and cub in Katmai National Park and Preserve, about 260 miles southwest of Anchorage. Also known as grizzly bears in Alaska, the brown bears pack a year of living into the summer months, foraging, feasting, frolicking, fighting, and mating under skies of nearly perpetual daylight.\nThe Alaskan varieties of brown bears are among the biggest in the world due in no small part to the summer bounty of food found on their home turf. Alaska springs to life in summer, and the bears take full advantage, eating up to 90 pounds of food per day. That kind of binge eating packs on 3 to 6 pounds of fat daily, which they will need to get through the long winter hibernation. It helps that grizzlies are not picky eaters. They'll eat berries, flowers, roots, fish (especially salmon), small mammals like beavers, and big ones like caribou. That diet helps them reach weights approaching 1,000 pounds. The biggest brown bears are found on the islands of the Kodiak Archipelago, off Alaska's southern coast, where a subspecies of about 3,500 bears have lived in isolation for around 12,000 years. Kodiak bears can weigh up to 1,700 pounds, three times the size of some of their North American and Eurasian cousins.\nCenturies ago, brown bears flourished in much of Europe, North Africa, California, and even Mexico. Although their numbers and territory have shrunk considerably, there are still about 200,000 brown bears in the world, most of them in Russia, Canada, and the US. As such, they are the most widely distributed bear species in the world. Some of the luckiest among them are these coastal bears of Alaska. Katmai is a verdant wonderland of mountain ranges, valleys, lakes, and rivers. The lack of roads in the region keeps pesky humans at bay. (Visitors must use boats or floatplanes.) In short, this mom and baby live in bear paradise, literally living large.",

Now pride parades and events are celebrated each June in most parts of the world—New York City's is still one of the largest pride celebrations. In 1999, President Bill Clinton gave Pride Month national recognition by declaring June 'Gay & Lesbian Pride Month.'\nOur photo today, of course, is of the now-iconic rainbow flag that symbolizes LGBTQI+ Pride.

Today we're in the lavender fields that carpet the Valensole Plateau in Provence, France. A rolling 300 square miles of flowers color the landscape as far as the eye can see. Vincent van Gogh spent time here, and featured lavender in some of his paintings. June is the start of the lavender season, and though it runs till August, peak viewing (and smelling) time varies a little with fluctuations in temperature and rainfall. There are lovely villages that you can meander while visiting the lavender fields, stopping for a pastry or crunchy-soft baguette at an outdoor cafe.\nHot, dry summers and plenty of sun help lavender thrive in the South of France and other countries that border the Mediterranean Sea. While we think the sight of lavender fields is relaxing in itself, the herb is always in demand for its essential oil, which lends a soothing scent to cosmetics, cleaning products, and even food. Some studies suggest that lavender can improve your sleep, reduce pain and inflammation, and relieve anxiety and depression. The powerful plant was also used as an antiseptic in days gone by, as it has antimicrobial and antiviral properties.",

Meaning 'jug' in the language of the ancient Amazigh people (aka Berbers), Tafilalet was named for the pottery jars they filled with water from underground springs. After the first permanent settlement of the region, Sijilmassa, was founded in 757 CE, Tafilalet became a stopping point for caravans traveling from the Niger River to Tangier on the northern tip of Morocco and the gateway to Europe.\nThe oasis here at Tafilalet thrives thanks to underground springs and wells, which are supplied by sandstone aquifers that can be hundreds of miles away. Surrounded by the dry sands of the Sahara, the life-giving waters here at Tafilalet support miles of date palm groves, a major industry in North Africa. Over the centuries, several villages have sprung up in this oasis, some of them with fortified kasbahs like this one, to withstand attacks from invaders.",

		"description": "Only in the tropics do forests grow in salt water. Take this forest of mangrove trees in Phang Nga Bay in southern Thailand, one of the largest and best-preserved mangrove forests in the country. Adapted to thrive in coastal marshes and swamps, mangroves can filter salt water and withstand strong coastal storms. Virtually all mangrove forests and all species of mangrove grow only in the tropical regions of the world. They are protectors of the coastlines, acting as a buffer against storms and floods.\nToday and on every June 29, we join the United Nations in marking the International Day of the Tropics, a moment to focus on the unique beauty of this part of the world and the challenges faced here. The tropics are roughly defined as the area above and below the equator between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn. By 2050, the UN estimates the tropics will be home to most of the humans on Earth, and two-thirds of the world's children. The tropics are also home to the poorest parts of our world and those most vulnerable to global warming.\nPhang Nga Bay on the Andaman Sea is one of the most treasured and visited sites in Thailand. The south-facing bay is about 150 square miles in size, and contains numerous limestone islets, tower karsts, cliffs, caves, and lagoons. At its mouth is the tourist mecca of Phuket Island. Much of the bay is protected as the Ao Phang Nga National Park, created in 1981 by royal decree. The most famous landmark in the park is probably Ko Tapu, a tall, cylindrical rock that is narrower at its base than at its top. It was featured in the 1974 James Bond movie 'The Man with the Golden Gun,' and has since been dubbed 'James Bond Island.' The real star of Phang Nga, however, is the mangrove. Resilient, wondrous, and beautiful, mangroves are an apt metaphor for the tropics they inhabit.",

		"description": "Today is Asteroid Day, and it's a reminder that as our planet follows its path around the sun, it encounters a lot of stuff. Science tells us that every day, Earth's atmosphere is hit with roughly 100 tons of dust and particles the size of a grain of sand. And every year, at least 30 small asteroids enter the atmosphere, only to burn up before touching the ground. NASA says it's pretty much guaranteed that at least one of them will be about the size of a car. As time progresses, the likelihood increases that even larger celestial rocks will hit the ground and cause significant damage.\nAcross the globe there are plenty of reminders of these events in the form of craters, like the one in today's photo. The Acraman crater is a point of impact in South Australia. It's believed to have been created about 590 million years ago when the Earth was hit by an asteroid with a diameter that could have been as large as 56 miles. For comparison, the asteroid thought to have killed the dinosaurs 66 million years ago was 6.2 miles across. NASA says that an asteroid the size of a football field would cause serious damage. One that could really threaten civilization hits every few million years. Hopefully, with 78 countries observing Asteroid Day, governments and scientific institutions are developing ways to protect Earth from an impact if a 'big one' shows up.",

The race will see riders in Stage 1 today cycling past iconic landmarks of the Danish capital like Tivoli Gardens and the Little Mermaid statue. From here, the racers will ride through other parts of Denmark, Belgium, Switzerland, and of course France before ending with the final stage on the Champs-Élysées in Paris on July 24.\nCopenhagen seems a fitting starting point for the world's most famous bike race, since it's so well known for being heavily invested in cycling for transportation, healthy living, and a commitment to green energy. That love affair with bikes is reflected in the cyclist figure of today's homepage image. Created by painter-turned-sculptor Einar Utzon-Frank in 1936, 'The Weather Girls' used to provide a quick forecast for folks on the square. Situated atop a rotating disc, the girl on the bike that we see here would spin out if fair weather was in the forecast. But if rain was expected, she would emerge with an umbrella.\nThe sculpture is no longer functional as a barometer, but the cycling figure mirrors the Danes in general—always out biking, rain or shine. The country makes cycling as convenient and enjoyable as possible, with separate traffic lights, dedicated bike lanes, cyclist-friendly traffic laws, and thousands of miles of segregated bike paths. Even the world-class competitors in the Tour de France would appreciate that.",

		"description": "Other than our pet dogs, no other canine species has succeeded more at living among humans than the fox. This is despite the fact that people have hunted foxes for sport and for their highly coveted fur, and generally regarded them as pests and nemeses. No matter how we feel about them, foxes seem to have earned our respect. Of all the animals that are arguably clever and crafty, the word we use is 'outfoxed,' not 'outcrowed,' or 'outbeared,' or 'outraccooned.'\nThe cunning fox is an appropriate poster pup for the 'dog days of summer,' which start today and end in 40 days on August 11. These long, hot, languid days of summer are associated with the 'dog star,' Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky and the predominant star of the constellation Canis Major (Greater Dog). The dog days begin when Sirius rises—that is, when the star first becomes visible above the eastern horizon—at least in the Northern Hemisphere. In the Southern Hemisphere, the appearance of Sirius marked the start of winter for Polynesians, who used it as a lodestar to navigate the ocean. For those of us up north, Sirius and the dog days simply mean keeping cool while enjoying the warmth and bounty of the longest days of the year. Foxes typically spend their summers parenting their offspring, called kits, and readying them for the fall when they will stake out on their own.\nTrue to their reputation, foxes are among the most adaptable and resourceful of animals. They live all over the world, in forests, grasslands, deserts, mountains, and even the Arctic. They eat primarily small rodents, but are opportunistic omnivores known to feed on reptiles, birds, insects, fruit, and roots. They are also expert scavengers and thieves when it comes to food. Perhaps the reason foxes are adept at living among people is because they're a lot like us.",

		"description": "Americans will spend this day in a myriad of ways, likely with others and likely outdoors. Many will be at carnivals and picnics, watching parades and listening to concerts. It's all in honor of the moment that the people of 13 far-flung colonies collectively declared they would become a united and independent nation, free of the rule of Great Britain and its monarch King George III across the Atlantic Ocean. For millions of Americans, Independence Day, or the Fourth of July, will end with the launching of fireworks over towns and cities, including the nation's capital of Washington, DC, shown here with the White House and the Washington Monument illuminated.\nThe Fourth of July is the date in 1776 that the Declaration of Independence was ratified by the Second Continental Congress, although it officially approved a resolution to split from Britain two days earlier on July 2. As president of the Congress, John Hancock signed the declaration first. His signature appears very large on the document, and to this day his name is shorthand for any type of signature. He and Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, and Benjamin Franklin all claimed to have signed on July 4, 1776, although that assertion has been debated. Jefferson was the principal author of the document. Most of the 56 signers of the Declaration of Independence signed a month later, an act that risked conviction of treason and punishment by death.\nThe American rebellion for independence ignited revolutions around the world, most notably the French Revolution, and shortly thereafter the Haitian Revolution, in which slaves successfully led an insurrection against French rule in the colony of Saint-Domingue, now Haiti. That inspired other Latin American colonies to fight for their independence from European powers. American independence was a contagion of freedom. You could say that colonialism, although its legacy remains today, began its descent in 1776, something we can all take to heart as we watch the night sky light up tonight.",

		"description": "Tucked into a tiny bay of a grand alpine lake is this granite bump called Fannette Island, the only island in Lake Tahoe. The massive lake lies in the Sierra Nevada at an altitude of 6,225 feet, straddling the state line between California to the west and Nevada to the east with near perfect symmetry. Fannette Island is in Emerald Bay, on the California side of Tahoe's southwest shore. A narrow inlet, seen here at the top center of this image, connects Emerald Bay to the rest of the lake, whose natural beauty draws visitors in all seasons of the year.\nLake Tahoe is known as a mecca for boaters and skiers and even gamblers who flock to the several casinos found on its shores. Its frigid alpine water is renowned for clarity. Despite cold winter temperatures that provide the surrounding ski resorts with ample snowpack, the lake never freezes. The largest alpine lake in North America, Tahoe rivals even the Great Lakes by volume because it is so deep.\nIce Age glaciers, nature's master sculptors, carved out Emerald Bay eons ago. For some reason, they left behind in their wake tiny Fannette Island. It was known by a half dozen names over the last century before Fannette finally stuck. A short hike to the top, 150 feet above the water, will take you to the ruins of an old stone building called the 'Tea House,' constructed in the 1920s by the former owner of the island as well as a nearby estate on Emerald Bay called Vikingsholm (the property is now owned by the state and is a popular feature of Emerald Bay State Park). The Tea House was used for exactly that, intimate tea parties in surroundings that would be nearly impossible to duplicate in any other home. While tea is no longer served atop the island, the alpine vistas are still there for the taking.",

Started in the United Kingdom, the holiday went global about 20 years ago as a yearly reminder that kissing isn't reserved just for greetings or social formalities. Puffins engage in an endearing form of courtship behavior seen here called billing, in which they playfully tap each other's beaks by swinging their heads from side to side.\nAtlantic puffins, also called common puffins, are the only one of three species of puffin native to the Atlantic. They inhabit the far north, in Newfoundland, Labrador, Greenland, Norway, and especially Iceland. They spend fall and winter on the open ocean fishing. They're expert flyers, swimmers, and divers and can spend years at sea without returning to land. They can fly as fast as 50 mph, and dive as deep as 200 feet for their food. Come spring and summer, adult puffins return to shore to breed and raise their young in cliffside colonies. A female lays a single egg, but both parents take turns incubating it, and later feeding their chick. Puffin couples often reunite each year at the same nesting site. How they find the exact same spot is a mystery.\nThese two puffins are enjoying the warm season in the far north of the Shetland Islands in Scotland. In winter, their beaks turn a drab gray, but come spring their colors return, just in time for mating season. That's probably not a coincidence, scientists have concluded. With beaks flush with bright colors, the billing begins. The behavior is generally limited to mated pairs, but sometimes puffins bill with neighbors as well. Whether you call it billing or kissing, it sure seems to be the way puffins show they care.",

		"description": "Heceta Head Light is perched 205 feet above the Pacific Ocean on Oregon's central coast. The headland is named for Spanish Basque explorer Don Bruno de Heceta, who led a secret expedition in 1775 to bolster Spain's claim to the Pacific Coast of North America. Having sailed from Mexico, by the time the voyage reached these shores, the crew was ravaged by scurvy and Heceta made the call to turn back—but not before he became the first to map and record a written description of the mouth of the Columbia River as well as this rocky 1,000-foot-high headland that would eventually bear his name. By the 19th century, seafarers making their way up and down the coast made the call for a lighthouse to guide their way. Construction of the 56-foot-tall lighthouse was complicated by the steep bluffs and remote location, but the first light beam pierced through the darkness on March 30, 1894.\nThe first lightkeepers at Heceta Head found the location too isolated, prompting several of them to leave the job after just a short period. Staffing turnover persisted until the 1930s when the nearby Oregon Coast Highway was put into service and the area received electricity. The lighthouse played a minor role in World War II when 75 members of the Coast Guard and their dogs were stationed here to guard the beaches. The lighthouse became fully automated in 1963, and by 1970 the lightkeeper's house entered a new era as a satellite campus for a nearby community college. These days the area is on the National Registry of Historic Places and the lightkeeper's cottages have a new life as rooms of a bed and breakfast.",

Whatever credence you give to Homeric tales of island hopping, there's no denying the appeal of the palm-lined Preveli Gorge or the enchanting beach it pours out to. Preveli Beach, just out of the frame of this image, was a favorite spot for hippie travelers in the '60s and '70s and remains an idyllic tourist destination today.\nLike most of the ancient, well-trodden Mediterranean islands, Crete—the largest of the many Greek isles—has a rich, epoch-spanning history. Here on Crete's southern coast, Preveli Gorge is home to an influential monastery with two building complexes: the Lower (Kato) Monastery of Saint John the Baptist and the Rear (Pisso) Monastery of Saint John the Theologian. The holy sites date back at least as far as the 16th century, and possibly had origins as far back as the 10th century.\nDuring the long occupation of Crete by the Ottoman Empire, Preveli Monastery was a center of rebellion and patriotism, with monks often serving as leaders and warriors in the many revolts against the occupiers. After more than 250 years, Crete finally won its freedom and joined Greece in 1913. The monastery would again find itself at the center of world events when it provided shelter and supplies to Allied soldiers fighting German occupiers during World War II.",

City planners and government officials will need to account for this rapid increase as power grids, water supplies, public transit, and emergency services will all be stretched.\nWorld Population Day was created by the United Nations in 1989 to focus attention on the urgency and importance of population issues. After hundreds of thousands of years, the world human population finally reached 1 billion around the year 1804. In just over 200 years since then it has exceeded 7.7 billion. It's expected to grow to around 8.5 billion in 2030, 9.7 billion in 2050, and to exceed 11 billion in 2100. How many is too many? What standard of living can we expect for people when there are more than 11 billion of us? And how many people can the planet sustain while also allowing nature to thrive? These are among the questions policy makers will confront as they consider the future of our world.",

		"description": "Today is International Rock Day and we're giving due respect to these geologic wonders. It might seem odd to sing the praises of rock, but think about it. Rocks have been with humankind since the beginning. From tools to housing to weapons, they've been key to our survival. A period of our history was so reliant on rocks that it will be forever known as the Stone Age. We would not be where we are today without the many minerals found on our planet, so rock on!\nTo celebrate, we're going to focus on one marvelous rock in particular: basalt, the most abundant volcanic rock on Earth. Here at the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland, there are roughly 40,000 interlocking hexagonal columns of basalt that were formed after an ancient eruption. Celtic legends tell different stories about the origins of the rock formation. One suggests that it was built as a battleground for two giants, Ireland's Fionn mac Cumhaill (aka Finn MacCool) and Scotland's Benandonner. Another legend claims that mac Cumhaill built the causeway to cross the North Channel to meet a Scottish lover. However it came to be, the Giant's Causeway is revered today as one of the United Kingdom's greatest natural wonders and is among the most popular tourist spots in Northern Ireland.",

		"description": "For Shark Awareness Day, let's consider things from the shark's point of view. Sharks get a bad rap. They may be apex predators of the oceans, but we're the ones most responsible for reducing their populations by more than 70% in the past half-century. Rather than perpetuate the stereotype of sharks being dangerous, let's think of them as they are—amazing sea creatures with hundreds of millions of years of history in their genes. We may not always want to encounter them face to face, but they deserve our respect and for the health of our oceans as whole, sharks deserve protection.\nTake these baby lemon sharks, for example. They're just hanging out in some mangroves off the Bimini Islands of the Bahamas. They're considered the best known of all shark populations because of research done at the Bimini Biological Field Station. But as well studied as they are, lemon sharks tend to avoid us. There have only been 10 reports of lemon sharks biting humans, and none of these bites were life-threatening. Notice these babies are sticking by each other's sides. Like many species of shark, lemon sharks prefer to be close-knit with one another. Social interaction is important to them, just as it is for humans. It helps them learn, cooperate, and survive. Sadly, humans have overfished the lemon shark, mostly for food, putting it on the list of vulnerable species. So, rather than live in fear of sharks, let's change the narrative to giving them a little space to live in peace.",

Well, that's the ancient village of Arrone. (On second thought, we probably didn't need the photo.) Arrone looks over the Valnerina, a valley carved by the River Nera, which twists its way through Italy's scenic Umbria region, known as the Green Heart of Italy.\nWhen you stroll through the narrow alleys between 9th-century stone houses, it's like entering a time warp. Gaze out from the fortifications, imagining battles of the past. You'll easily spot the iconic square clock tower, with an ancient olive tree on top—it's what remains of the fortress built by the founders of the village, the Arroni family.\nAs you're walking through the past, make sure to visit both of Arrone's churches. Since you're at the top of the village—'La Terra,' to locals—explore the modest 13th-century San Giovanni Battista Church and its stunning works of art. Check out the bell tower, too: The 'Campanari di Arrone' (bell ringers of Arrone) are guardians of traditional bell-ringing methods. In the village's lower section, you'll find the Church of Santa Maria Assunta, which is filled with gorgeous frescoes dating to the early 16th and 17th centuries. And don't forget to marvel at the 16th-century glazed terra-cotta sculptures. So many ways to explore history in such a little village.",

		"description": "Birds, bees, and flowers grace today's photo, but we're going to bet that potato chips will be what you remember tomorrow. First the basics: We're in South Carolina looking at a beautiful American goldfinch perched atop a sunflower. While the matching color scheme makes for a great photo, it's likely this little bird has stopped for a meal. American goldfinches are among the strictest vegetarians in the bird world, preferring grains and seeds, especially sunflower seeds. That's why it's not uncommon to see them in neighborhoods with well-stocked bird feeders. In fact, human activity has generally benefited American goldfinches overall. The birds thrive in areas where forests have been removed—they prefer open meadows or fields covered in weeds.\nThe European goldfinch has long been kept as a pet bird, perhaps due to its ability to learn simple tricks. Meanwhile, its American cousin prattles on about potato chips. That's its signature call. The American goldfinch has several vocalizations but its most common is a twitter that sounds distinctly like it's calling out 'po-ta-to-chip, po-ta-to-chip.' In the birding community, the call is so unique and distinguishable that the American goldfinch is referred to as the 'potato chip bird.' Perhaps more interesting, the bird has been observed to distinctly oscillate as it flies, dipping down and back up, over and over, as it screams 'po-ta-to-chip' on the upswing. So, next time you have a hankering for chips, give a listen for nature's advertising agent calling out a not-so-subtle message.",

		"description": "July is National Bison Month and we've chosen today to honor America's official and largest land-dwelling mammal. The male American bison in today's photo is lazing among wildflowers in Yellowstone National Park, the only place in the country where there's been a continuous population of bison since prehistoric times. Once widespread across the American plains and revered by Native Americans, they numbered in the tens of millions. Tragically, settlers hunted the bison nearly to extinction by the late 1800s. Fewer than 1,000 of the giants were left in 1905 when the American Bison Society was formed to save them. These days, the population has stabilized with a little more than half a million bison spread across the country, with a few thousand living freely on the plains at Yellowstone.\nYou may know this majestic bovine as a 'buffalo,' which, depending on who you ask, can be considered an incorrect name. Believed to originate from the French word for beef ('boeuf'), 'buffalo' was first attributed to the beast as early as 1616. The word 'bison' didn't see use until 1774, but now it's the term preferred by most scientists. Some argue that the only 'true' buffaloes are the species of water buffalo originating in Africa, the Indian Subcontinent, and Southeast Asia.\nAmerican bison, due to near extinction, are mostly genetic hybrids, the result of bison mated with domestic cattle. These hybrids are commonly known as 'beefalo.' Only about 5% of American bison are genetically 'pure,' which includes the population at Yellowstone and another at Elk Island National Park in Canada. No matter what you call them, the bison is a noble creature worthy of awareness and conservation.",

Today, on National Moon Day, we remember one dream that came true on this date in 1969: the day humans first set foot on the lunar surface. So far, it's the only place beyond our planet that humans have visited.\nFifty-three years ago, millions of people around the world watched NASA astronaut Neil Armstrong step out of the Apollo Lunar Module Eagle and onto the surface of the moon. Fellow astronaut Buzz Aldrin followed him 19 minutes later, and the pair spent more than two hours exploring the landing site and collecting samples of lunar material. A third astronaut, Michael Collins, flew the command module that took them back to Earth and did not have a moon walk of his own. The three astronauts of the Apollo 11 spaceflight spent eight days in space before splashing down in the Pacific Ocean. The moon landing gave the US a victory in the space race with the Soviets.\nThe moon is Earth's only natural satellite, orbiting our planet about every 28 days, in what we refer to as a lunar cycle. The moon has virtually no atmosphere, no evidence of life, no water, no sound, and very low gravity. It is literally a dusty ball of rock. Yet, the moon stabilizes Earth's wobble on its axis and therefore moderates our climate. Most scientists believe it was formed out of debris ejected from Earth after a massive collision with another planet-like body. If that's true, the moon is part of Earth, inextricably linked to it forever.",

The gardens have changed with the times, all while still jealously guarding their history. The site here in the county of Suffolk, in eastern England, was originally home to a powerful Benedictine abbey in medieval times—in fact, 2022 marks the 1,000th anniversary of the storied abbey. You can still visit the abbey ruins and marvel at the 14th-century Great Gate and Norman Tower, which have survived through the ages. Nathaniel Hodson took the original abbey gardens and designed them as a botanical garden in 1831, using the Royal Botanic Gardens in Brussels, with their concentric circles, as his inspiration.\nA century later, the people of Bury St Edmunds saw the popular park's circular beds replaced by 64 island beds set off by specially designed illuminations in honor of George VI's 1937 coronation. A water garden and rose garden added more dimensions to the park, followed by an herb garden (the monks of yesteryear would be happy) and a sensory garden for the visually impaired. Today, gardeners plant about 20,000 plants in the spring to dazzle summer visitors, and then 12,000 plants and 20,000 bulbs each fall in anticipation of a colorful display the next spring.",

		"description": "Local legend here in Perast, Montenegro, has it that two brothers were returning from a dangerous sea voyage in 1452 when they spotted an icon of the Virgin Mary and Child in the waters near Saint George, a natural island in the Bay of Kotor. One of the brothers had injured his leg on the journey, but in the morning it had healed. Taking this as an omen, they vowed to honor the Virgin Mary by building her a church on the spot where they'd found the icon. They began dropping stones there, and even scuttling old ships. A tradition was born, and over decades, the fishermen of Perast would drop a stone in the water at that spot before heading to sea.\nOver time an island rose out of the bay and a church was erected on it. The centuries since have seen tumult, war, pirate attacks, and at least one devastating earthquake, but Our Lady of the Rocks still stands. The tiny isle continues to grow, as each summer on the evening of July 22, the town celebrates Fašinada, a ritual procession of barges and boats that take more stones to Our Lady of the Rocks. The church is decorated with 68 frescos by local artist Tripo Kokolja (1661-1713) and boasts more than 2,500 silver votives donated by locals.",

Of course, since most moths are nocturnal, you may want to leave a light on outside to see them. The elephant hawk-moth in our photo will always see you, regardless of the available light. Not only does it have super-sensitive eyesight, it can see in color—in fact, scientists say it was one of the first species they could prove had nocturnal color vision. We were fascinated to discover one reason for the elephant hawk-moth's great eyesight: It uses a lot of energy flapping its wings to hover and feed from flowers, so it has to be efficient when looking for its next floral feast.

		"description": "Few people in modern history have captured our imagination as much as the famed aviator Amelia Earhart, born on this day in 1897. She was doubly a pioneer of her day, a skilled pilot when flying was a relatively new and daring endeavor, and a woman in a field dominated by men. Earhart's legend was made, sadly, not as much by her piloting accomplishments as by her sudden disappearance in 1937 when her fame was still ascending. The 39-year-old famously went missing, along with navigator Fred Noonan, in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, near Howland Island, while attempting to fly around the world. The official search for Earhart and Noonan lasted 17 days. The US Navy and Coast Guard searched 150,000 square miles of the Pacific, an effort that became the most expensive search in history at the time. Her husband, George Putnam, led a private search in the months that followed. No verified trace of Earhart, Noonan, or the twin-propeller Lockheed Electra plane has ever been found.\nEarhart was born in Kansas and began flying lessons at age 23 soon after taking her first flight. She bought her first plane a year later and with it, set the first of her many records: the altitude record for a woman pilot at 14,000 feet. In 1928, she became the first female passenger to fly across the Atlantic. Then, in 1932, she became the first woman to fly nonstop solo across the Atlantic, and the second person (after Charles Lindbergh) to accomplish the feat. Later that year she became the first woman to fly alone across the US and set the women's distance record of 2,447 miles. In 1935, she became the first person to fly from Hawaii to the US mainland. By then Earhart was an American hero, an international celebrity, and a role model for women and girls.\nHer premature demise has spawned countless theories, documentaries, books, movies, tributes, and a permanent place in popular culture. We'll never know what else she could have accomplished had she lived longer. But in her relatively short life, she created a legacy that has far outlived her.",

You may know it as a carousel, like the Golden Gallopers Carousel at the seaside in Brighton, England, seen in today's photo. The word 'carousel' is possibly derived from the Spanish 'carosella,' meaning 'little war.' Carousels have a history that goes back centuries, with roots in medieval jousting competitions. As the war game grew in popularity, commoners without horses wanted to participate, and carousels with wooden horses soon appeared at fairgrounds. The popularity of carousels led to many advancements over the years, including the up and down galloping menagerie of animals real and imagined, and the instantly recognizable music that became widespread after 1803.\nJuly 25 is an important date in the history of the carousel. On this day in 1871, the first US patent for a carousel was issued to a William Schneider, thus designating him the ride's official inventor. Once fully patented, the carousel in the US entered its golden age. Nearly 3,000 of them were made between the 1880s and 1930s. These days, it's believed less than 175 of those classic wooden carousels are still operating. The National Carousel Association was formed in 1973 to conserve and restore these works of art for future generations to appreciate.",

		"description": "Although we think of forests as trees on land, some of the most important trees grow in water, or more precisely, marshland. Mangrove forests, like this one in Saloum Delta National Park in Senegal, are vital components of the world's coastal ecosystems. Mangroves survive where no other trees can, in salty, low-oxygen coastal waters exposed to tides and storms. They grow up to 30 feet high primarily in tropical and subtropical regions and are able to store vast amounts of carbon, making them crucial to moderating our climate. Mangroves also act as nurseries for fish and aquatic life. And with their complex, interwoven root systems, they protect coastlines from erosion. Today we join the UN in shining a light on the necessity and fragility of mangroves: July 26 is the International Day for the Conservation of the Mangrove Ecosystem.\nThe Saloum Delta is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and a sterling example of the biodiversity of marshlands. These shallow, brackish channels contain about 200 islands and islets and support all kinds of marine life and birds. Dolphins and caimans swim in its creeks. Monkeys, warthogs, buffaloes, rhinos, and giraffes roam the savanna farther inland. The park biosphere includes salt flats, estuaries, and of course mangrove forests. Humans have also long inhabited this delta, fishing its waters and cultivating shellfish. For as long as 2,500 years, people have flourished off the bounty of the Saloum Delta, a bounty made possible by the sturdy mangrove, the bedrock for these marshes, and the keeper of the coastline.",

The Nabataeans were Arab people whose precise origins are unknown. They lived in northern Arabia and the Southern Levant. Mada'in Saleh was their second-largest and southernmost city after Petra, their capital city to the north. About halfway between Petra and Mecca, Mada'in Saleh served primarily as a trading crossroads and was instrumental in establishing the Nabataeans as prosperous middlemen to the rest of the ancient world.\nToday Mada'in Saleh is one of Saudi Arabia's most celebrated historic treasures, and a UNESCO World Heritage Site, distinguished by more than 100 tombs with ornate facades, carved from sandstone outcroppings on the outskirts of the city. The smallest is less than 10 feet tall, the largest more than 60. Most of the tombs were carved in groups, but the especially embellished monument in our photo is relatively isolated, which is why today it's known as the Qasr al-Farid (the Lonely Castle). Here in this windswept desert the bustle of merchants and the caravans full of spices are long gone, but these hand-carved boulders rising abruptly out of the landscape remain as evidence of a time when all roads led to Hegra.",

The tiger's natural territory once consisted of almost all of Asia and parts of the Middle East but has been reduced by 93%. Of the nine known subspecies of tiger, at least three are now extinct (and a fourth is likely extinct). Most tigers, like this gang of sisters, live in isolated, protected pockets. The largest number of wild tigers, by far, live here in India, where 70% to 80% of the world's tiger population can be found. (Russia and Bangladesh are a distant second and third.) Although tiger mothers give birth to up to four cubs every two years, only half of all cubs survive into adulthood.\nTigers are the largest of all cats, weighing as much as 660 pounds, and the largest terrestrial animal whose diet consists solely of meat. They are ambush predators who hunt mostly at night, relying on stealth and strength to take down large prey like deer, boar, buffalo, and even crocodiles—tigers are famously good swimmers. Their stripes serve as good camouflage in forests and tall grass, and each tiger's stripes are as unique as fingerprints are among people. Mona, Seeta, Lara, and Sonam, the tigress sisters, began to hunt together to improve their chances of landing prey. This behavior is typical of lions but almost unheard of for tigers, proving they can adapt in order to succeed.",

		"description": "Today we're taking a tramping trip to New Zealand's South Island to visit the place Rudyard Kipling once called the eighth wonder of the world, Milford Sound and its surrounding rainforest. Tramping, New Zealand-speak for hiking, is incredibly popular at Milford Sound. Nearly a million tourists visit the fjord every year, despite its somewhat remote location. Originally overlooked by European explorers, the area is now known for its beauty and abundance of wildlife. It's not uncommon for visitors to spot dolphins, humpback whales, and native Fiordland penguins.\nSince 1998, Milford Sound is one of about 90 places in New Zealand to officially join its European name with the older, Indigenous Māori name. Now known as Milford Sound/Piopiotahi, the Māori named the area after the extinct piopio bird. According to myth, the Māori hero Māui died during his quest to win immortality for humankind. A single piopio flew into the fjord to mourn him. This bird was memorialized in the name, as the Māori word 'tahi' means 'one.' The Māori people first traveled to the area centuries ago to hunt and fish. They also collected the precious pounamu (aka greenstone) used for trade, carving, and weaponry.",

		"description": "It's around this time of year when some lucky people get to witness these rare, wondrous clouds. Known as noctilucent, or 'night-shining,' clouds, they're the highest clouds in our sky and are only visible during summer. They're made up of icy dust glowing at the edge of space, roughly 50 miles above the planet's surface. The trick to seeing them is to gaze up into the sky at twilight, when sunlight is not reaching the Earth's surface, but is still shining through the high-altitude noctilucent clouds. These clouds occur more often at high latitudes but have been seen lower than 50° north and south.\nGenerally colorless or light blue, noctilucent clouds are distinct in their patterns of streaks, waves, and whorls. It's not fully known why they happen, though some recent studies suggest methane levels could contribute to atmospheric water vapor that rises high into the mesosphere where they form. What is known is that they were first observed in 1885.",

		"description": "The orange glow of a lava tube like the one pictured here is a frequent sight on Kīlauea, the youngest volcano on the island of Hawaii. In near constant eruption for the last 40 years, Kīlauea is widely considered the most active volcano in the world and is the main attraction at Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park, which was created on this day in 1916. The park, which was designated an International Biosphere Reserve and a World Heritage Site, also includes another active volcano, Mauna Loa, the world's most massive shield volcano, which last erupted in 1984. Together, they are among the most studied volcanoes in the world.\nThe volcanoes of the Big Island of Hawaii offer a real-time glimpse into the ongoing creation of the entire Hawaiian island chain, a process that has been underway for tens of millions of years. The Hawaiian Islands exist thanks to a volcanic hotspot on the ocean floor. Magma seeps from this hotspot and turns into solid rock. Once enough magma is extruded, the rock breaks the surface of the sea and becomes an island. The island continues to grow until the Pacific tectonic plate moves the island off the hotspot. The hotspot remains stationary, constantly creating new islands.\nHawaiian religion credits the creation of Hawaii to Pele, the goddess of fire and volcanoes. Possessing a fiery temper and a passionate nature, she is said to make her home in the Halema'uma'u caldera here on Kīlauea. From her volcano home she controls the flow of lava and frequency of eruptions. According to modern legend, she sometimes wanders near the park as an old woman wearing a red muumuu and accompanied by a white dog, as a warning that a new eruption is soon to come.",

		"description": "You won't find a lot of solitude on the Hickman Bridge Trail, a 1.7-mile route in Capitol Reef National Park that leads to this magnificent natural arch. The trail is used by hikers, runners, and nature lovers drawn by incredible rock formations, gullies, and remnants from the ancient Fremont Culture civilization. Hickman Bridge itself is one of the best-known geologic features of the park.\nCapitol Reef National Park was first established as a national monument on this day in 1937, then became a national park in 1971. Capitol Reef is named for its massive rock domes that reminded nearby residents of that famous rotunda of the US Capitol Building back in Washington, DC. Why Capitol 'Reef,' though? Because the imposing formations were major obstacles to travelers through the region, the same way a coral reef is an obstacle to sailors.\nThe geology of the park is defined by the nearly 100-mile Waterpocket Fold, a wrinkle in the Earth's crust that formed around the end of the dinosaur era. Wind, rain, and time have eroded the Navajo Sandstone into colorful canyons, buttes, and natural arches like Hickman Bridge. The dramatic rock formations make Capitol Reef a favorite destination in the American West.",

		"description": "The red-necked grebe has a bit of a split personality—in fact, it only lives up to its name about half the year. Its feathers are not red but brambly brown and gray throughout the winter, when it lives a low-key, quiet life in salt water along North American and European coasts. But just before it migrates to a northerly lake, pond, or swamp for breeding season, the plumage around the grebe's throat turns a distinctive rust-red. Both males and females undergo the plumage change.\nThis colorful phase lasts from May to November or so, during which the previously placid bird becomes given to loud calls and rambunctious mating displays. Maybe it's all in the family: Grebes are more closely related to flamboyant flamingos than to their fellow diving seabirds.",

The flowers bloom during the seasonal flood from August to November, cloaking an incredible 15 square miles of wetlands in gorgeous, fragrant pink. The village of Satla, in the Barisal District of south-central Bangladesh, is known as the capital of 'shapla,' or water lilies, for obvious reasons.\nGrowing and harvesting the lilies is a community effort, and farmers sell the flowers in local markets. Not only are they bought for their looks, but they're also valued in traditional Ayurvedic therapies for their medicinal properties. You can even find the stalks and seeds of water lilies on your plate as you enjoy a local vegetable curry. No wonder the popular, beautiful, and versatile water lily is the national flower of Bangladesh.",

Today the castle hosts the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo, a full-on Scottish experience, with bagpipes, drums, and seemingly enough kilts to cover all of Scotland. Enthusiastic visitors can also indulge in whisky and haggis in one of the many hostelries on the Royal Mile, the colorful, bustling historic street that wends its way from the castle down to the Palace of Holyroodhouse, Queen Elizabeth II's official residence in Scotland.\nThe Tattoo is a spectacular show of military music, dancing, and ceremony that runs alongside the Edinburgh International Festival, which also starts today and goes through August 28, and the Edinburgh Festival Fringe (August 5-29), its sprawling, less formal sidekick. The main festival—celebrating its 75th anniversary in 2022—is an invitation-only event that brings together top classical musicians and stage performers from around the globe. The Fringe is decidedly casual. It's the world's largest arts festival and features all types of music, street performers, amateur theater productions, stand-up comedy, and more, often in city streets, church halls, pubs...basically any available space. Think free-spirited and fun. One thing's certain: Edinburgh in August keeps everyone entertained.",

		"description": "You might be wondering where the volcano is in today's photo, but that's not lava. These are salt flats in San Francisco Bay—many of these tidal marshes have been developed into evaporation ponds for the harvest of sea salt. If you happen to be in the air and flying over this part of the country, you'll notice pools of not just bright orange but green, blue, and even magenta among the famous salt ponds. The vibrant colors are determined by brine shrimp, algae, and other microorganisms and their responses to different levels of salt. This orange results from a mid-level saline concentration and the presence of tiny brine shrimp in the water. Green indicates low levels of salt, while pink or red are signs of high salt content in an algae-rich pond.\nWhen Spanish explorers and missionaries arrived in the area in the late 18th century, members of the Indigenous Ohlone people were already extracting salt from the naturally occurring ponds. The California gold rush (1848-1855) brought waves of settlers to the region, and salt became one of San Francisco's largest industries. Roughly 80% of the wetland was eventually lost to salt mining, landfill, or other industrial alteration. But since 2003, many of these tidal flats have been acquired by federal and state agencies as well as private foundations to be restored to their original state. The restoration process will take decades, but even as the wetlands are being restored, about half a million tons of sea salt are harvested from the ponds every year.",

		"description": "It's Lighthouse Day in the United States, so let's stroll over to Spring Point Ledge Light on the breakwater next to Southern Maine Community College in South Portland, Maine. Lighthouse enthusiasts will recognize this as a caisson-style light station, meaning it's a lighthouse built on top of a water-tight chamber called a caisson. In the US, caisson lighthouses were once known as 'bug lights' because at a distance they appeared short and broad, a bit like a beetle on the surface of the water. After the invention of the internal combustion engine, the shape reminded many people of spark plugs, so they started calling them 'spark plug lighthouses.' Most caisson lighthouses are offshore or on dangerously exposed sites, but this is the only spark plug lighthouse in the country that visitors can walk to.\nSpring Point Ledge Light warns boats approaching Portland Harbor of the hazardous ledge that it's named for. This underwater ridge reaches out into the shipping channel and was the cause of many shipwrecks in the late 19th century, when the harbor was one of the busiest on the entire East Coast. Built by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, Spring Point Ledge Light has been a reliable guardian of Casco Bay and Portland Harbor since 1897. The brick and cast-iron lighthouse earned its spot on the National Historic Register in 1988. In May 2022, people celebrated the 125th anniversary of the first time the lamp was lit, back when it guided schooners and hulking steamships safely to shore.",

		"description": "There isn't much to the tiny island of El Pantaleu (or Es Pantaleu in Catalan), cast off the westernmost shore of Mallorca, itself an island only about 60 miles across. Pantaleu and Mallorca are part of the archipelago of Balearic Islands in the Balearic Sea, off the east coast of Spain. Mallorca, Ibiza, Menorca, and Formentera are the chain's four major islands, famous as destinations for tourists seeking the warm Mediterranean climate and inviting shoreline.\nPantaleu is more precisely an islet, a mere rock about 6 acres in size. Its highest point is 80 feet. Not much grows on El Pantaleu, and no one lives on it. Mallorca is only about 1,000 feet away, making it a vigorous but doable swim for the many who have tried from the beach at the village of Sant Elm. Technically, no one is allowed to set foot onto Pantaleu, because it is designated a nature reserve along with the much larger Dragonera Island a few miles farther to the west.\nPantaleu is most useful as a windbreak for boats, as you can see from this aerial photo. The notch between the islet and the main island is a popular anchorage for the many pleasure boats that cruise these waters. Even centuries ago, sailors understood the value of Pantaleu. In 1229, the young James I the Conqueror, King of Aragon, sheltered his fleet from a storm behind Pantaleu before invading the Balearics to make good on his nickname. These days, most of the turf wars around here have been settled, although you might have to battle a vacationer for a spot on the sand or a table at happy hour.",

		"description": "What at first glance appears to be graffiti tagged on a rock wall is, in fact, artwork created by the first human settlers of this remote region deep in Argentine Patagonia. It's thought that the cave paintings were made between 13,000 and 9,500 years ago. The archaeological site is known in Spanish as the Cueva de las Manos (Cave of the Hands). It's the largest display of prehistoric handprints in the world, made all those years ago by people holding a hand against the rock wall and blowing pigments through tubes made of bone. Of the 829 black, white, red, and ochre prints, most are of young male hands. One print has six fingers, and only 31 are of right hands.\nThe cave paintings were created in at least three waves over thousands of years by ancestors of the Tehuelche people. Archaeologists have hypothesized that the artists were hunter-gatherers. This theory is supported by the fact that even older than the handprints are depictions of guanacos (a relative of the llama, and the main source of food at the time), rheas (large flightless birds), and hunting scenes.\nToday, more than 476 million Indigenous people live in various regions of the world, like the Teheulche, who continue to live in Patagonia near the southern border between Argentina and Chile. To honor and protect the rights of the world's current Indigenous populations, the UN marks each August 9 as International Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples. We'll raise our hands in support of that.",

		"description": "These immensely photogenic and relatable trees, their shaggy, sinewy limbs thrust upward into the pale light of the desert sky, are the main reason people come here to California's Joshua Tree National Park. Joshua Tree was declared a national monument on August 10, 1936, before being designated a national park in 1994. Perhaps no other national park is so completely defined by a single feature, be it a plant or wildlife or natural formation. While Joshua Tree National Park contains other wonders, this tree that looks drawn by Dr. Seuss is what visitors come to celebrate.\nThe park (and the town of the same name) could also be called the hippest national park in the country, owing to its proximity to Los Angeles, and the Insta-worthy, charismatic flora that have helped make JT a darling on social media. Vanlifers, artists, celebrities, and other creative bohemians have fueled a boom in tourism, not just to the park itself, but to the surrounding towns, like Pioneertown. The kitschy outpost served as an old Hollywood set and is now a center of nightlife in the area. Pappy & Harriet's Pioneertown Palace serves artisanal cocktails with its barbecue and features live music, sometimes from the likes of Paul McCartney, Robert Plant, and Patti Smith. And if you can't find an elderflower martini in Joshua Tree, then Palm Springs and Indio and Coachella are a short drive away, something Yellowstone and Yosemite can't claim.\nBut for those going purely for the nature—the hikers, rock climbers, campers, and stargazers—the 1,200-square-mile park is no less a marvel. Two deserts, the high-elevation Mojave and the low-elevation Colorado, merge here, each with its own ecosystem. The Joshua tree itself grows only on the Mojave side, at elevations between 1,300 and 5,900 feet. Most of the world's Joshua trees are found here. A variety of yucca, Joshua trees live from 500 to 1,000 years with roots as deep as 35 feet. Most believe their name was first concocted by Mormon pioneers who likened their branches to the outstretched arms of the biblical Joshua. It proved catchier than its botanical name, Yucca brevifolia. And as any influencer worth their followers will tell you, it makes for a much more memorable hashtag.",

Nearly three-quarters of the country is made up of mountains, thanks to its location in the Pacific Ring of Fire volcanic zone. Japan's four major islands—Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, and Shikoku—all have ranges running through them.\nThe 9,065-foot Mount Tsubakuro, which we feature in our home page image today, is a popular hiking destination on Honshu with well-maintained trails, rest areas, and lodges. Beautiful scenery abounds here, less than three hours' drive from Tokyo.\nAccording to the legislation that established Mountain Day, the observance was launched to provide 'opportunities to get familiar with mountains and appreciate blessings from mountains.' One of those is snow-capped Mount Fuji, Japan's tallest mountain (12,389 feet) and one of the most pictured peaks in the world. Japan's rugged terrain is a boon for its tourist industry, with plenty of spots to ski and climb—or just relax in ancient hot springs.",

		"description": "Today is World Elephant Day, when we focus on these remarkable creatures and pledge to protect them. African elephants, like those shown here, are the largest living land animals, with bull elephants standing a whopping 13 feet tall at the shoulder. Their distinctive trunks and big, flapping ears make them one of the first animals every child can recognize. Adults marvel at the close family bonds they create and the way a herd rallies to protect its members, grieving when one dies. They form a strong, social community over their life span of about 60 to 75 years.\nSadly, elephants attract negative attention too. Around 100 of the massive African elephants are killed by poachers every day, their tusks stolen for the lucrative and illegal ivory trade. In fact, the most recent comprehensive census of African elephants shows their populations decreased by 62% between 2002 and 2011, and they have lost 30% of their geographical range, according to the World Wildlife Fund. And this decline continues—it's feared that elephants could be headed to extinction by the end of the next decade. Wildlife biologist Dr. Jane Goodall has studied and written about elephants: 'I have spent hours and hours watching elephants,' she says, 'and come to understand what emotional creatures they are…. It's not just a species facing extinction, it's massive individual suffering.'\nThe elephant family pictured here lives in Amboseli National Park in Kenya, home to more than 1,500 African elephants. The park is also home to the Amboseli Elephant Research Project, which has studied, observed, and protected African elephants for 50 years. This World Elephant Day, let's all find a way to help these majestic beasts and guarantee them a safe, happy future in the wild.",

The Boundary Waters wilderness stretches for 150 miles along the US-Canada border within Superior National Forest. Known by those seeking solitude, Boundary Waters is one of America's most beautiful and remote locations. Formed long ago from the scraping and gouging of glaciers, the area is distinct with its rugged cliffs, canyons, and thousands of lakes and streams. More than 1,200 miles of canoe routes are enjoyed by thousands of people every year.\nCanoeing the many waterways may be the main draw, but 80% of the area is forest. In fact, the Boundary Waters wilderness contains the largest swath of uncut forest in the eastern US. That's even after the 1999 'Boundary Waters blowdown,' a powerful July 4 derecho storm that lasted 22 hours and took down millions of trees with its 100-mph winds. Many animals call the forest home, including the largest population of wolves in the contiguous states.\nIf you're a night owl, the Boundary Waters wilderness offers a unique opportunity. In 2020, the area was designated one of only 15 Dark Sky Sanctuaries around the world by the International Dark-Sky Association. This differs from a normal Dark Sky designation in that its fragile landscape is one of the planet's most remote locations, free of light pollution and ideal for night sky observation. The point is, night or day, you're sure to find something worth your time at the Boundary Waters.",

The individual species have developed adaptations for survival as varied as their environments. Chameleons and geckos camouflage themselves so well they can seem to almost disappear. Many lizards will detach their tails, a technique called tail autonomy, to distract predators while they escape. The frilled-neck lizard fools would-be predators by spreading out a large frill around its neck, making itself look large and scary.

		"description": "At 8 miles in circumference, the Chittorgarh Fort is one of the largest forts in India, a nation with scores of ancient and medieval fortresses. For starters there are seven massive gates from which to enter. Inside you'll find four palaces and 19 temples. At one time there were almost 100 bodies of water, most of them ponds fed by natural catchment and rainfall, although now there are only 20. Chittorgarh ('garh' means 'fort,' so it's also known as Chittor Fort) is so old, no one is sure exactly when it was built, although reports of its earliest capture go back to the 8th century. It is one of six large forts in the northwestern state of Rajasthan referred to as the Hill Forts of Rajasthan, all of them collectively designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. We're featuring this important and ancient complex on India's 75th Independence Day, one of India's three national holidays.\nOn August 15, 1947, India officially broke free of Great Britain and became a sovereign and democratic nation with the speedy passage of the Indian Independence Act. The paperwork might have been fast, but the struggle for independence from British rule lasted 90 years and cost many Indian lives. The British controlled the Indian subcontinent for nearly 200 years, after winning the decisive Battle of Plassey in 1757. The victory allowed the English East India Company to eventually exercise control over most of the rest of the Indian subcontinent, Burma, and Afghanistan. East India remained the supreme authority in India for a century until 1857 when a massive rebellion by civilians and Indian soldiers against the company was suppressed, resulting in direct British rule, referred to as the British raj.\nThe ensuing decades saw the formation of the Indian National Congress, the rise of Indian nationalism, various armed rebellions, and many acts of civil disobedience led by Mahatma Gandhi and others, before independence was finally achieved. While India as we know it is still a very young nation, the Chittor Fort reminds us the land and people that created modern India have endured and thrived for millennia.",

		"description": "To really get the feel for today's photo, stop what you're doing, put your hands in the air, and imagine yourself plunging downhill at 50 miles an hour. Screaming is optional. It's National Roller Coaster Day and we're waiting in line at Morey's Piers in Wildwood, New Jersey, for our ride on the Great White. A hybrid wooden and steel coaster, it's been in operation since 1996 and reaches its highest point 110 feet above the ground. Coaster enthusiasts point out the ride's dip under the pier shortly after the start as one of its highlights. It's also noted for a portion of the ride swinging out over the nearby beach.\nRoller coasters have come a long way since their early days beginning in the 17th century as Russian sled rides. Eventually called Russian Mountains, those original rides were just tall, wooden ramps covered in ice. When the concept made its way to the much warmer France, the sleds rolled across the tracks on wooden rollers, hence the name 'roller coaster.' Coasters saw another advancement in the 1870s when a Pennsylvania mining company built a downhill gravity railroad to transport coal. Its train cars held double duty by giving thrill rides to tourists during down time.\nBy the 1920s, coasters had entered their 'golden age.' New construction techniques allowed designers to build them taller, longer, and faster, drawing crowds to newly opened amusement parks around the world. These days, the United States alone has about 760 roller coasters, and thrill seekers take them on roughly 1.7 billion rides per year. Aieeeeee!",

		"description": "Get your clothespins ready, it's Surströmming Day! For the uninitiated, that means we're in Sweden and cracking open this year's surströmming harvest to enjoy its putrid wonder. Surströmming is Baltic herring that's been caught in April and May, then lightly salted and allowed to ferment. Beginning in the 1940s, a royal ordinance forbade the selling of Surströmming before the third Thursday in August to prevent incompletely fermented fish from being sold. The ordinance is no longer on the books, but the tradition holds.\nSwedes indulge in fermented herring from bloated cans that most insist should be opened outside and preferably underwater. That's the recommended way to alleviate the stench from what some call the world's worst-smelling food. You may have seen popular 'challenge' videos of people trying to brave the experience and failing miserably. That's part of the fun, even if those videos are not the best representations of a true surströmming feast.\nIn today's photo, we're visiting a small fishing village on the island of Källö-Knippla in Gothenburg's northern archipelago. People there today might enjoy some surströmming on top of tunnbröd (flatbread). It's common to cover the fish in red onions, sour cream, and dill and then wash it all down with a shot of booze, a beer, or even milk. The taste is said to be very sharp, savory, and even acidic. That is, if you can keep it down. One food critic famously said that 'the biggest challenge when eating surströmming is to vomit only after the first bite, as opposed to before.'",

		"description": "In the summer of 2016, an experimental solar-powered airplane called Solar Impulse 2 completed a 26,000-mile multi-stage trip around the world without using a single drop of jet fuel. The remarkable feat took longer than a year and made the slow-flying plane part of aviation history. We are remembering this seminal flight today to mark National Aviation Day, established in 1939 by President Franklin Roosevelt as a day to celebrate the advancement of flight. August 19 was chosen because it is the birthdate of Orville Wright, who in 1903, with his brother Wilbur Wright, became the first to achieve powered, controlled flight on the hills of Kitty Hawk on North Carolina's Outer Banks.\nSolar Impulse 2 was the second aircraft built by Swiss aviators André Borschberg and Bertrand Piccard. Borschberg is an engineer by training, Piccard a psychiatrist and balloonist who copiloted the first balloon to fly around the world nonstop. The pair took turns piloting the aircraft, which can carry only one person, on a multi-leg, 16-month flight around the world that started and ended in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates.\nThis image was taken during the final leg from Egypt to Abu Dhabi as Solar Impulse 2 flew over the Great Pyramids of Giza. The superlight plane was powered by thousands of solar cells mounted atop its fuselage and jumbo-jet sized wings. Batteries stored energy so it could fly at night. The going was slow by the standards of modern jet travel—Solar Impulse 2 flew at an average speed of 50 mph. Clearly, solar-powered flight on a commercial scale is still many years away, but as this photo shows, its Kitty Hawk moment is in the books.",

		"description": "Today we're celebrating World Honey Bee Day, honoring the humble bee's role in pollinating our crops and sharing honey goodness with us. It's remarkable to consider that there are around 20,000 different species of bees in the world, but just eight species of honey bees. And it's sobering to realize how fragile their existence is. Billions of honey bees have disappeared over the last 15 years in what's known as colony collapse disorder. There's no definitive explanation for the die-off, though scientists believe pesticides, loss of habitat, climate change, mite infestation, and disease are contributing factors. Now we need to reintroduce bees and other pollinators to safeguard our food system.\nOf course, besides pollinating plants, bees produce honey to feed their hive community over the winter. And since honey bees produce double or triple the amount of honey they need, there's plenty for us to enjoy, too. Unfortunately for busy beekeepers here in the northwest province of Asturias, Spain, local endangered brown bears are also partial to snacking on honey. Hence the traditional stone wall protecting the hives from sticky-pawed thieves.\nWhile the bear has always had pride of place in Spanish culture—it's the symbol of Madrid, for example—bears' reputation for plundering honey hives and sometimes even killing livestock makes them unpopular with beekeepers and farmers. The brown bears of Spain were once aggressively hunted, and the bear population fell to dangerously low levels by the 1970s. Conservationists worked to gain legal protection for the bears, and now there's a delicate balance between bears and bees in Asturias. Ecotourism here in the Muniellos Nature Reserve helps beekeepers and farmers sustain their businesses, with carefully organized tours allowing visitors to observe the bears from a distance while spending money on local honey.

We're looking out at the sea on the Costa da Morte, or Coast of Death, a nasty name for an equally nasty (but beautiful!) stretch of Galician coastline in the extreme northwest of Spain. We're featuring Costa da Morte during International Lighthouse Weekend because mariners are never happier to see a lighthouse than when they're sailing this coast, known as the Bermuda Triangle of the Eastern Atlantic.\nThe Costa da Morte is known for its lighthouses, like this one, called Faro de Playa Lago, one of many strung along 125 miles of coast from Finisterre in the south to Malpica in the north. As a devourer of ships, the Costa da Morte is prolific. Since the 14th century, more than 600 shipwrecks costing thousands of lives have been documented. The rocky Costa da Morte faces the open North Atlantic and takes the brunt of big ocean swells. Deep waters turn to shallow waters quickly near this rocky cliff-strewn coast, known for its strong currents and hidden rocks. The fog can roll in quickly. Storms form frequently. And hurricane-force winds are not uncommon.\nCool, rainy, and rocky, the Galicia region of Spain is more 'Lord of the Rings' than Club Med. To visit the lighthouses of Costa da Morte, you can walk a trail appropriately called Camino dos Faros (Road of the Lighthouses). While satellite technology and electronic instruments have vastly changed how safely we can now navigate the seas, lighthouses are still vital to boating and the maritime industry. Plus, they're just darn good-looking.",

		"description": "Forget looking up in the trees to find these guys. They are burrowing owls, which means that they live on the ground or under it. In fact, they often take advantage of the hard work of tunnelers such as prairie dogs or gophers by building their nests in the burrows they dug and abandoned. Think of burrowing owls as squatters of the avian world. You'll find these 7½- to 11-inch birds in North and South America, especially in grasslands, farming areas, or dry expanses with vegetation that is close to the ground.\nAnother of their behaviors is most unowl-like, too: While most owl species are nocturnal, burrowing owls prefer to be out and about during the day snagging bugs (except when they shelter from extreme midday heat). But they do hunt for small mammals at night using the tactical advantages of their superior hearing and night vision. They hunt by air and by land, swooping down from branches but also using their long legs to hop along the ground to catch critters, just to keep them on their toes.\nIn their downtime, burrowing owls snooze at the mouth of their burrows or in hollows in the ground, which do double duty as a dirt bath. If they're startled, the owls do a cartoonish bounce, then run to the safety of their burrows, uttering screams and clucks to scare off the intruder. They even mimic rattlesnake sounds to send their foes packing. These quirky birds also reject the traditional owl 'woo-who' in favor of 'coo-coooo' and the nighttime 'co-hoo.' Talk about owls of a different feather…",

On February 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine in a major escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian War that began with Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. NATO and Europe have rallied to Ukraine's cause, and a war that many expected to last weeks has stretched into months, with the Western-backed Ukrainian forces thwarting Putin's ambitions and not showing any signs of relenting.\nToday we demonstrate our solidarity with the people of Ukraine by featuring this image that evokes the flag of their nation—a field of golden wheat below a bright blue sky. Ukraine, together with Russia, has long been known as the 'breadbasket of Europe.' In recent years, Ukraine has been the world's fifth-largest exporter of wheat, accounting for 7% of global sales. Grain yields are so high partly because Ukraine is home to a quarter of the world's highly fertile 'black soil,' or chernozem. Disruption of Ukraine's wheat production and distribution, and the theft of its grain by Russia, threaten to diminish the world's food supply and cripple Ukraine's vital farming sector.\nA recent agreement that the UN brokered with Russia has allowed some of the grain trapped in Ukraine's silos to begin flowing out of the country once again. But it remains unclear how long this fragile deal will hold and whether it will bring relief to the world's hungry or to Ukraine's economy. We can only hope the people of the besieged nation are granted the independence they have strived for.",

		"description": "While most of us play in our vast system of 63 national parks, others work there. Today, on National Park Service Founders Day, we recognize their efforts and the priceless gift of our country's national parks. The NPS protects and maintains these parks as well as hundreds of national monuments and other natural, historical, and recreational properties. They include some of our most stunning natural landscapes, like North Cascades National Park in Washington state, featured here. This image, of the Triplets and Cascade Peak, is taken from atop Forbidden Peak.\nThe NPS was created on August 25, 1916, when President Woodrow Wilson passed the Organic Act. At the time there were nine national parks and 33 federally protected areas such as national monuments. Today there are more than 400 such areas, managed by 22,000 NPS employees and 340,000 volunteers. The oldest national park is Yellowstone, created in 1872, believed to be the first national park in the world. The youngest is New River Gorge in West Virginia, created in 2020. Fourteen national parks have been designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites, and 21 named UNESCO Biosphere Reserves. Thirty of our 50 states have national parks, with California having the most with nine. Alaska has eight, Utah five, and Colorado four. Alaska has the four largest national parks. Not surprisingly, the vast majority of our national parks are west of the Rockies.\nNorth Cascades is one of three national parks in Washington state (the others are Olympic and Mount Rainier). North Cascades is also the state's newest national park, created in 1968. It is perhaps the most rugged park in the lower 48 states, containing more than 500,000 acres of steep mountain peaks and vast forests, as well as the headwaters of many waterways. It boasts the most expansive system of glaciers in the US outside of Alaska. Most of the park is protected as wilderness so there are few roads, structures, or signs of human impact. It is relatively isolated even though it's within 100 miles (as the crow flies) from the metropolises of Seattle and Vancouver, Canada. This proximity of wilderness to human development reminds us why we created the NPS, to preserve some of the nation's most special places in their natural state.",

		"description": "Of the many ways people have invented to ride boards of one kind or another, the sport of kiteboarding (aka kitesurfing) is one of the newest. It owes a debt to all the board sports that came before it, borrowing a little bit from snowboarding, water skiing, wakeboarding, and of course windsurfing. Like snowboarders and skiers, windsurfers and kiteboarders often share play space, as they are doing here off the Pelješac Peninsula in Croatia. They can count on a stiff afternoon breeze to fill their sails in the summer months, when the land heats up and draws in the cool air over the Adriatic.\nPeople began experimenting with kiteboarding in the late 1970s, and with key technical innovations in the '90s, the sport began gaining popularity. Many windsurfers were drawn to kiteboarding because the detached sail—in this case the kite—gave the kiteboarders more freedom to maneuver. The kite is inflated, giving it structure and the ability to float should it land on the water. In a sign that the relatively new sport has entered the mainstream, kiteboarding will make its Summer Olympic debut at the Paris 2024 Games as one of 10 sailing events.",

Not only was it not established until this late date, but before the mid-20th century, much of the land here simply didn't exist. Flevoland was created through vast land reclamation projects in the 1950s and '60s. While the Dutch had been reforming their landscape to meet their changing needs for hundreds of years, the 20th century would see their most dramatic and ambitious projects realized. The province's anthem is the fitting 'Waar Wij Steden Doen Verrijzen' ('Where We Let Cities Arise'). It's an ode to pushing back the sea and creating a 'province that's not bad, youngest part of the Netherlands. Where it is nice to live, my beloved Flevoland!'\nWith its landscape of bogs, marshes, and swamps, Flevoland is a perfect nesting ground for these bearded reedlings. The reedlings are sometimes referred to as bearded tits, due to their passing resemblance to the long-tailed tit, but not only are they not tits, they don't really have beards either (though the males have something closer to a mustache). Found across Eurasia, the bearded reedling is considered a unique songbird, with no other living species closely related to it.",

		"description": "The Baltic Sea in northeast Europe is a peculiar body of water, combining the characteristics of a sea with those of a lake and an estuary, too. Strictly speaking, it is in fact a sea and thus appropriately named, joined to the Atlantic Ocean through three straits in Denmark: the Öresund, Great Belt, and Little Belt. Technically, the Baltic is classified as a brackish sea, meaning it is not entirely fresh and not entirely saline. The Baltic Sea isn't landlocked, but it does border many countries, including Russia, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia—and it's the Estonian coast featured in today's image.\nLike a lake, the Baltic is relatively shallow with an average depth of 150 feet. Its salinity is so low it nearly qualifies as a freshwater sea. That's because hundreds of rivers and streams empty into the sea, and more fresh water falls on the sea in the form of rain and snow than evaporates. The Baltic can also be described as a giant estuary, into which flow several major rivers. Sailors favor the Baltic because there is very little current and tide to contend with, and even when surface winds pick up, the seas remain relatively calm. Easy to navigate, gateway to so many lands, the Baltic has been integral to trade and commerce—and inevitable conflict—in the region for centuries. It has been known by many names, proof the Baltic is a true meeting place.",

Wild creatures from frogs to elk roll the dice with death when they need to traverse the thousands of highways humans have threaded through wildlife habitat. Sadly, the dice don't fall favorably for millions of animals each year, and collisions with vehicles often cause fatalities for both them and the drivers who hit them.\nMany countries now construct wildlife crossings—also called green bridges, ecoducts, natuurbrugs (like this one in Wierden in the Netherlands), and écoponts (in France). These can be either overpasses or underpasses, and they are an expensive venture. Are they worth it? Well, officials in Banff National Park in Alberta, Canada, would say categorically yes. Over 20 years they built 44 bridges and underpasses so wildlife could cross the Trans-Canada Highway, which divides the park; traffic accidents involving wildlife dropped by 80%.\nFrance built the first overland wildlife crossings in the 1950s and continues to invest in many elaborate safe passageways. But the Netherlands leads the initiative, with an impressive 600-plus wildlife crossings, and counting. In fact, the Dutch can claim the honors for the world's longest animal crossing too—the Natuurbrug Zanderij Crailoo is an overpass that's half a mile long and 55 yards wide.

This big little island is small enough to drive across in a few hours but full of wonders, from mountain ranges to gorges to beautiful beaches. Take this jewel box of turquoise water near the port city of Chania, for example. Set on the easternmost of three peninsulas that stick out like horns from the northwest shoreline of Crete, Seitan Limania is one of the most photographed beaches on the island.\nSeitan Limania is beautiful to behold from a distance but driving up close via the narrow switchback roads takes some nerve. And once you get to the parking lot, the rocky hike down is for only the most surefooted of beachgoers. On your way down, you'll likely meet some of the goats that populate the area. The narrow cove is flanked by steep rock walls that zig one way, then zag the other. When you reach the beach, you'll find yourself on one of the most beautiful spots on any coast—and a selfie here at Seitan Limania is hard to beat for bragging rights.",

		"description": "The Petronas Twin Towers are the unmistakable calling card of the Malaysian capital city of Kuala Lumpur, affectionately called KL. The 88-story, 1,483-foot cylindrical towers were the tallest buildings in the world when they were completed in 1996, until 2004 when Taiwan's Taipei 101 topped them by almost 200 feet. Still the tallest twin skyscrapers in the world, they're our perfect inspiration today on Skyscraper Day, set aside to appreciate such engineering and architectural feats.\nThe Petronas Towers, named for Malaysia's state-owned oil and gas company, were designed by the late Argentine American architect César Pelli, who incorporated motifs of Islamic art into his postmodern design. It remains his masterpiece, and a true standout in a country and continent full of skyscrapers. One of the most notable features of the buildings is a two-level skybridge that connects the towers at the 41st and 42nd floors. The bridge is not actually anchored to the main structure, but freely slides into each tower to accommodate any swaying caused by wind.\nThe preponderance of supertall structures in Asia isn't a coincidence. Skyscrapers spring up where populations are high, land is in short supply, and economies flourish. Plus, for an up-and-coming city, nothing says you've arrived like a gleaming skyscraper—or a pair of them. And why stop there? Even the Petronas Towers, though emblematic of the KL skyline, are no longer the tallest kids on the block in Malaysia: A new skyscraper, the 2,227-foot Merdeka 118, is expected to be completed in 2023 as the second-highest building in the world.",

		"description": "Known for its immense, densely populated cities, India also has a seemingly endless coastline. And no part of it is more languid and lovely than Arambol, in the small and special state of Goa on the southwestern coast. Arambol is a popular holiday town with the vibe of a sleepy fishing village—which it was once was. Now visitors from around the world are drawn to its tropical climate, rainforest valleys, historic architecture, and sandy beaches.\nGoa is distinct from much of India as it was colonized by Portugal while Great Britain occupied the rest. The Portuguese Empire conquered Goa in the early 1500s and ruled it until 1961, when it was annexed by India. The influence of the Portuguese can be seen in Goa's Catholic churches and convents, as well as in the name of the state's largest city: Vasco da Gama, after the explorer who once governed Goa.\nIf history isn't your thing, Arambol is famous for a drum circle and flea market held on the beach a few hours before sunset. It's just as much a beach party as a market. Craftspeople sell handmade wares while musicians join impromptu performances. There's no better way to end your day in Goa, land of sand and spice and sun.",

		"description": "Our historical Labor Day photo shows striking textile workers taking to the streets of Gastonia, North Carolina, voicing their grievances and seeking support for their cause. By the time of this 1934 strike, the textile industry had been struggling for years to keep pace with the economic times, and workers were struggling as their wages were cut while their workloads increased. Things came to a head after the National Industrial Recovery Act became law in 1933, leading to the formation of the Textile Industry Committee meant to represent the interests of business owners, consumers, and workers—but this only led to shortened workweeks, effectively reducing wages by 25%. Workers rushed to join the United Textile Workers union to get their voices heard and demand improved conditions.\nOn Sept. 1, 1934, some 65,000 North Carolina textile workers stayed home, shuttering the state's mills. When this photo was taken on Sept. 3, the workers were hopeful that they could achieve change. The governor called out the National Guard to protect the mills, and a couple of weeks later the strike effort crumbled due to lack of union resources and a surplus of fabric on the market. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt did go on to appoint a committee to mediate the situation, and the consensus was that the textile workers' grievances had substance and should be investigated further. Unfortunately, the actual investigation never happened.",

It might surprise you, but squirrels don't only eat nuts. They'll eat just about whatever's around and that includes big mushrooms. Though a small percentage of wild mushrooms can be poisonous to humans, squirrels can eat many of these frightening fungi without worry, thanks to special proteins in their guts. Nice to know someone's enjoying them.\nDid you know the United States has a Mushroom Council? Since the early 1990s, the US Mushroom Council has worked as a Research and Promotion program of the Department of Agriculture. After an informal declaration during a Pennsylvania mushroom festival, the council proposed National Mushroom Month not just to highlight mushrooms as a culinary delicacy, but also showcase many other uses for the more than 900 million pounds of mushrooms the US produces each year. Believe it or not, we use mushrooms to build, clean, medicate, and even make leather—and so much more.",

Don Pedro I, first emperor of Brazil, was a member of the Portuguese ruling family (he would eventually briefly rule Portugal too). When Portugal threatened to take back the political autonomy Brazil had enjoyed since 1808, Pedro sided with his adopted homeland against the Portuguese. After a three-year war that was largely bloodless, the Empire of Brazil, which preceded the vibrantly diverse democracy we know today, was born on September 7, 1822.",

		"description": "The first recorded expedition to successfully circumnavigate the Earth returned here to Seville, Spain, 500 years ago today. This was the remnants of the Spanish fleet that had set sail under the command of Ferdinand Magellan almost exactly three years previously with the goal of finding a western sea route to the rich Spice Islands of Indonesia. While Magellan gets the glory as leader of the expedition, he didn't actually complete the marathon voyage—he had been killed in a skirmish in the Philippines in April 1521. In the end, his place as leader of the five-ship voyage was filled by Juan Sebastián Elcano, whose command ship, the 'Vittoria,' was the only one in the convoy that survived the trip. Harsh conditions, starvation, scurvy, hostile encounters, and other struggles had taken their toll: Of the roughly 270 crew members who set out, only 18 returned with the expedition.\nAlthough he made only half of this globe-circling journey, Magellan is rightly honored as an outstanding navigator, especially given the rudimentary knowledge of world geography and relatively primitive navigational tools of the time. He was the first European to traverse the strait that now bears his name near the tip of South America, trailblazing the first known passage between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. The eventual success of Magellan's expedition, however bedraggled its remaining crew, also offered the first practical proof of a notion many 16th-century people were still skeptical about: The Earth is round.",

Declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996, the Belize Barrier Reef has remained relatively healthy even as many of the planet's reefs are threatened by climate change.\nFeatured here is a mangrove forest on Lighthouse Reef, one of three major atolls (above-water sections of reef that form ringlike, often lush island chains) in the reef system. It's the most visited of the atolls for one reason: Near its center is the Great Blue Hole, a marine sinkhole that's 1,043 feet across, 407 feet deep, and a bucket-list destination for serious scuba divers. Now protected within the Blue Hole Natural Monument, the hole was made famous when oceanographer Jacques Cousteau charted its depths in 1971.\nThe barrier reef is by far Belize's most popular tourist attraction, a destination for diving and fishing as well as sightseeing. An exceptionally diverse ecosystem, it includes more than 400 cays or islands, mangrove forests, coastal lagoons, estuaries, and coral atolls.

But aracaris are much more social nesters: Up to six aracari adults and all their babies might live in one nest.\nToucans are found in tropical climates in Central and South America, mainly in rainforests—our chestnut-eared friend tends to live in the southern Amazon Basin. Known frugivores, or fruit eaters, toucans have also been spotted eating the occasional lizard or even rival bird.

		"description": "In the late 1800s, pioneers in Utah who wanted to expand their settlements south into Arizona were confronted by 600 miles of deep canyons carved by the Colorado River. By 1873 a ferry was established to cross the Colorado at the mouth of Glen Canyon—Lees Ferry, as it was called, remained vital to settlers in the area for more than 50 years, until authorities decided a bridge would provide more reliable and safer crossing. Construction began in 1927 of a span across the 834-foot gap of Marble Canyon, at the head of the Grand Canyon. When Grand Canyon Bridge opened to traffic in 1929 it was hailed as a 'modern marvel' and 'the biggest news in Southwest history.'\nBut as time passed, the bridge, which was officially renamed Navajo Bridge in 1934, saw heavier vehicles and more traffic. Debates raged over the traffic’s impact on Native land and endangered plants, and the likelihood of debris falling into the river below. The solution was a new, nearly identical but wider second bridge just downstream from the original bridge. It was dedicated on September 14, 1995, to much fanfare. Both bridges, collectively known as Navajo Bridge, are about 470 feet above the river below. The original span serves as a path for humans and horses while the new bridge carries vehicles.",

Its subjects highlight local cultural heritage, including portrayals of agricultural production and industrial work. Through conversations with members of the community, Casañas incorporated symbolism inspired by the mixed and integrated Latinx community of Buffalo.\nHispanic Heritage Month, a celebration of Hispanic and Latinx contributions to the United States, takes place each year from September 15 to October 15. Why doesn't it start at the beginning of the month? Because September 15 and 16 are important dates for many Hispanic communities in the Americas. On September 15, 1821, five Central American nations (Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua) declared their independence from Spain, almost 11 years to the day (September 16, 1810) after Mexico had declared its independence. These countries were specifically mentioned when US President Lyndon Johnson proclaimed the enactment of what was then Hispanic Heritage Week. In the 1980s, the week became a month, and Belize (which had declared independence from the UK on September 21, 1981) was added to the list of celebrated nations.",

While tourists will sometimes see the big cats on their own, trained guides take visitors on hikes or all-terrain vehicle tours to look for the stealthy pumas. The wild cats have been officially protected for the last few years, bolstering their population, and there are abundant guanacos in the Patagonian steppes, which also helps.\nThe puma (which is the same big cat you might call a mountain lion or cougar) is the fourth-largest cat in the world, following the lion, tiger, and jaguar. Pumas don't roar like their large cousins—instead, they purr like house cats. That might explain why people in Patagonia simply call pumas gatos ('cats' in Spanish). With their characteristic slim build and impressive camouflage coloring, these canny hunters can live 10 years in their remote Patagonian home.",

Rising as a manicured oasis of stories-high bamboo, the grove seems to turn the world green. The former villas and temples of the old noble class are located near the Arashiyama Grove, and its single 500-yard path is usually filled with visitors wielding cameras and selfie sticks, making this serene view a rare one.\nWorld Bamboo Day, celebrated September 18, was created in 2009 to bring attention to this useful and versatile plant that flourishes in East Asia. Though the tallest bamboo can grow up to 100 feet, bamboo is not a tree but a grass. Known for its light weight, strength, and rapid growth, bamboo can be used to make almost anything, from clothing to building materials—and its shoots can even be consumed as food. Because it grows as much as 3 feet in a day, it's a highly renewable resource. For the same reason, it's also an invasive species in some places, as a small stand of bamboo can quickly become a large one. While bamboo grows best in tropical and warm climates, it adapts well to cool temperatures and high altitudes. And though it might have the most cultural value in Asia, it grows wild in Africa, the Americas, and Australia, too. Could there be bamboo growing near you?",

		"description": "Officially called Enhydra lutris, and unofficially known as the cutest creatures that float, these sea otters in Sitka Sound, Alaska, are doing what otters do, showing us that it truly does take a village, in this case a flotilla. Groups of either males or females (sometimes with pups), are appropriately named rafts. Male rafts tend to be larger and can number more than 1,000 individuals. Sea otters' buoyant bodies indeed work like literal rafts, standing in as cradles, dinner tables, or any kind of solid surface. That's handy because otters spend the vast majority of their lives in the water, even giving birth in the sea. Although they seem to live carefree lives, frolicking and grooming and diving, they also serve an important role in keeping their aquatic ecosystems healthy, something to remember this week as we mark Sea Otter Awareness Week, observed every year during the last week of September.\nOtters keep the giant kelp forests of the Pacific Ocean healthy by eating sea urchins, which would otherwise decimate kelp, an important habitat for many fish and other sea creatures. Otters also eat crabs, shellfish, squid, and other invertebrates. They've learned to crack the shells of some of their shellfish prey by smashing the crustaceans and mollusks against a rock (fetched from the sea floor of course) lodged on their bellies. An otter's caloric needs are huge. It must eat a quarter of its body weight each day to keep up with its cold-water metabolism.\nThe key to an otter's aquatic lifestyle is its fur, the thickest of any mammal, with about 1 million hairs per square inch, so dense its skin never actually gets wet. Otters need all those gazillion hairs to stay warm as they don't have a layer of blubber like other marine mammals. Their luxuriant coats made them favorite targets for 18th- and 19th-century trappers who hunted otters to near extinction before they were protected by law. Although sea otter populations have rebounded, they are still considered endangered. Otters live along the Pacific Coast of North America, from California up to Alaska. Although they can walk on land, they almost never find the need or desire to, even when it's nap time. When they're ready for a snooze, they'll raft up, wrap themselves in a strand of kelp to keep them from drifting away, and recline on the world's biggest waterbed.",

		"description": "Today we're marking the International Day of Peace, first commemorated in 1981, when the United Nations dedicated the day to 'strengthening the ideals of peace, through observing 24 hours of nonviolence and ceasefire.' This year's theme is 'End racism, build peace.' As the UN says, 'Achieving true peace entails much more than laying down arms. It requires the building of societies where all members feel that they can flourish. It involves creating a world in which people are treated equally, regardless of their race.'\nOur photo today shows a striking symbolic artwork that seems as if it were commissioned to commemorate the International Day of Peace. Thousands of hands helped create 'Peace Doves,' an artwork installation from 2021 by sculptor Peter Walker that pulled together children and community groups in Liverpool, England. People wrote personal messages of peace on 18,000 paper doves, then those birds joined a dramatic heavenward flight of doves suspended on 15.5 miles of ribbon from the ceiling of Liverpool Cathedral. The lighting drew the focus to the powerful art installation, and if you stood inside the canopy of doves, you could look up and see where the strings of birds converged into starry points of light. Composer David Harper's musical soundscape added yet another layer to the artwork, which people flocked to—60,000 visitors marveled at the 'Peace Doves' in the first month. The main impressions noted? 'Beautiful' and 'moving.'",

		"description": "There's a chance this dazzling, ground-up view of fall foliage is not where you think it is. While New England garners most of the leaf-peeping attention in the US this time of year, the high country of Colorado puts on a spectacular show out West. The aspens of the Centennial State turn shades of gold and orange in autumn, which officially starts today. Fall typically marks the end of vacations, the beginning of school, the arrival of chilly nights, and, if you're lucky, a display of leaves turned brilliant shades of gold and red.\nThis thicket of aspen trees is on the Last Dollar Road, an 18-mile scenic drive in southwest Colorado that is as dramatic as its name suggests, with switchbacks and stunning views of peaks and meadows and of course the aspen trees that paint the land come September. Aspens thrive in the cold winters and cool summers of western North America, where they grow at altitudes between 5,000 to 11,000 feet. Their distinct, round leaves quake in the wind, making it appear as if the trees are glittering in the sunlight. Aspens generally grow on west-facing slopes, gorging on the afternoon sun. They're among the world's largest living organisms because aspen groves share a single root system. They're also the state's only native deciduous tree and cover about a fifth of its forested land.\nThere are many places to see them, but none better than the Last Dollar Road. It's unique among scenic byways in the US. For one, it's not a highway at all, but a road, and a dirt road at that. It joins the towns of Ridgway in the north and Telluride in the south, but this bumpy path twists and turns in every direction as well as up and down. The road is never plowed, so when the first snow falls, the road closes and stays closed until spring arrives. That makes this the last time of year you can take this drive, and it happens to be the most beautiful. Just make sure your tires have plenty of tread and your shock absorbers are ready for a workout.",

		"description": "If you're lucky enough to see this view through the lens of your diving mask, you must be snorkeling in Jellyfish Lake on the island of Eil Malk in the Pacific island nation of Palau. Golden jellyfish are a subspecies unique to this small lake, on this small island—they're found nowhere else on the planet. Millions of teacup-sized golden jellies inhabit the lake, following the sunlight that nourishes them. Symbiotic algae live inside the jellyfish and provide their hosts with energy as a byproduct of photosynthesis. The more sun the jellies get, the more energy they derive from their hitchhikers. The jellies start the day at the east end of the lake and drift westward until dusk, following the arc of the sun.\nThe saltwater marine lake they live in is one of dozens in the Rock Islands, which Eil Malk is part of. The Rock Islands, declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2012, is a scattering of hundreds of very small, mostly unpopulated limestone islands and islets characterized by their mushroom-like shapes. On Eil Malk, Jellyfish Lake appears to be landlocked, but it's connected to the ocean by three shallow tunnels that bring water into and out of the lake with the tides. Nevertheless, the lake is so isolated from the nearby lagoon that the golden jellies evolved in this micro universe mostly cut off from other food sources and predators. As a result, they've lost their ability to sting. So, if you take a dip—snorkeling is allowed, but not scuba diving—there's no need to keep a polite distance.",

		"description": "This striking photo lets us showcase two noteworthy events in one day, at no extra charge. (You're welcome.) National Public Lands Day is observed on the fourth Saturday in September, and today's also part of the Acadia Night Sky Festival, which celebrates the starlit skies over Maine's gem of a national park.\nIt's easy to take our national parks for granted. We certainly appreciate them and enjoy visiting, but today's commemoration reminds us that they also need our help. National Public Lands Day turns the spotlight on parks and other public lands, inviting everyone to explore but also to volunteer to plant trees, work on trail-maintenance projects, and more. As a bonus: Admission is free today at national parks, monuments, and other participating federal sites.\nAcadia is one of the smallest of the nation's 63 national parks, but it's attracted an impressive 4 million visitors annually in recent years. Aside from its natural beauty, Acadia has some of the most spectacular star-filled night skies in the eastern United States. The natural darkness is protected, with restrictions on outdoor lighting in the park and surrounding areas. The Acadia Night Sky Festival, which started on September 21 and continues through tomorrow, celebrates the natural darkness and the celestial star show. A favorite way to mark the occasion is by kayaking in Castine Harbor, where bioluminescent phytoplankton illuminate the water with a swirling, unearthly glow. With sparkling waters below and out-of-this-world stargazing above, it's been called Acadia's 'Floating Planetarium.'",

		"description": "On World Rivers Day, we honor what may be thought of as the queen of them all—the Amazon, which flows more than 4,000 miles mostly through the South American countries of Peru and Brazil. The Amazon discharges a whopping 58 million gallons of fresh water into the ocean every second, enough to fill 83 Olympic-sized swimming pools, far more water than any other river in the world. It accounts for 20% of all fresh water that flows into the world's seas and oceans. It's also the vital heart of the largest and most diverse rainforest in the world. The Amazon rainforest is home to a third of the world's animal species and its trees and plants pull billions of tons of heat-trapping carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year, making it one of the Earth's best defenses against climate change.\nMark Angelo, a river conservationist from British Columbia, launched World Rivers Day in 2005 to recognize the importance of rivers to the survival of humanity and millions of species all over the world. Rivers are our best source of fresh water, they can be an important energy source, they're the foundations of complex ecosystems, and they provide crucial sources of irrigation for our crops, among other contributions to our way of life. Besides, who doesn't love a float down a lazy river?",

		"description": "It's that time of year when Alaskan caribou are beginning to feel a little frisky. From late September until early November, males will be strutting their stuff, locking antlers with one another, and competing for the attention of females in hopes of furthering the species. Successful males will mate with 15-20 females a season. After the rutting season males will shed their antlers while females keep theirs until spring. In today's photo we're looking at some caribou in southcentral Alaska crossing the Susitna River.\nAlaska has 32 distinct caribou herds. It's likely today's caribou are members of the Nelchina herd, which roams across about 20,000 square miles in the high basin surrounded by the Talkeetna, Chugach, Wrangell, and Alaska ranges. The Nelchina herd is among the most studied and recognized of Alaskan caribou partly because their range is relatively close to the major human population centers of the state. The herd has provided food for Alaskans for hundreds of years and its population is maintained through carefully monitored hunting regulations. But caribou populations can fluctuate from one year to the next depending on the availability of food and severity of the weather.",

		"description": "The highest concentration of geysers in the world is found here in this corner of Yellowstone National Park, called the Upper Geyser Basin. They include what is perhaps the most famous geyser of them all: Old Faithful. But the Upper Basin contains many other geysers as well, including the tallest predictable geyser (Grand Geyser) and the most voluminous geyser (Giant Geyser). Yellowstone contains about 500 geysers, roughly two-thirds the number in the entire world.\nGeysers are essentially a rare form of hot spring—a water-filled tube that extends thousands of feet into the Earth's crust, so deep it makes contact with molten rock called magma. The magma is so hot that the water boils, builds to an extreme pressure, then shoots into the air, emptying the tube. After some time, more groundwater seeps into the tube, filling it, and starting the process over again. That's why geysers erupt at somewhat regular intervals. The bigger the tube, the more water, and the longer the eruption. Yellowstone is one of the few places in the world where you can safely walk among so many geysers and superheated springs, and view them close up. Trails and boardwalks guide the way, making the Upper Geyser Basin one of the star attractions of this famous national park.",

		"description": "At one point in history, the United States had upwards of 14,000 wooden covered bridges. Most of them were built between 1825 and 1875 to cross a stream or river and were intended to withstand the elements. An uncovered wooden bridge may have a life span of only about 20 years while a covered bridge could stand for more than 100. Even still, they don't fare well without upkeep and restoration costs can be high. That's why iron replaced wood as the preferred bridge-building material in the mid-1800s. These days, fewer than 900 of the original wooden covered bridges are believed to still be standing. The A. M. Foster Bridge, seen in today's photo, can be found in Cabot, Vermont.\nNamed after Alonzo Merrill Foster, the inventor of a type of spout for collecting maple tree sap to be made into syrup, the bridge is located on Spaulding Farm. Don't be deceived—the Foster Bridge is actually a 1990s replica of a 'farm bridge' that was built in 1890 and known as the Orton Bridge. Despite being a replica, the Foster Bridge was authentically constructed by hand, in collaboration with Foster's great-grandson, with spruce lumber and salvaged granite. Spanning 45 feet across a pond and literally bridging the gap between two farms, it took less than six weeks to complete. Unfortunately, the bridge was found to be too narrow for modern farm equipment, a miscalculation that its constructors found amusing. Still, it works well as a photo opportunity and frequent venue for weddings.",

Now fashion is a major industry and art can be a lucrative field, too. Today we're celebrating 'wearable art,' which blurs genres and has passionate devotees. Curious? Well, check out the World of WearableArt (WOW), which is WOW-ing (sorry) fashion and art fans with its awards show in New Zealand right now. The competition runs till October 16 and features work by global designers, artists, and costumers—it's New Zealand's largest theatrical production. The competition is just part of the event, though—there are dancers, musicians, and aerialists, too.\nOur photo shows Infini-D, a 2019 winner that is, according to a press release, 'a homage to Yayoi Kusama—a meditation on geometry, dimensionality, and cinematic postmodern gothic,' by Australian designers Tara Morelos, Ahmad Mollahassani, and Nelia Justo. It's not just the look that's unconventional: The outfit was created using electronics, acrylic, cardboard, and fabric. We suspect it's not designed to be worn in the rain.\nWOW is the brainchild of Dame Suzie Moncrieff, a sculptor who envisioned art displayed on the moving human body rather than static, dull gallery walls. She organized the first event in 1987, in the rural New Zealand area of Nelson, where she lived. Now it's held in New Zealand's capital, Wellington, and it's become a worldwide phenomenon, with 103 designers from around the globe delighting audiences this year.",

		"description": "The end of September in the Southern Hemisphere means warming weather and the nearing of summer. For southern right whales like this one off the coast of Argentina, it's time to migrate southward toward Antarctica and rich feeding grounds. Southern right whales are a subspecies of right whale that inhabit the oceans below the equator. They feed on krill at the surface of the water, holding their mouths open as they swim through clouds of the tiny crustaceans.\nRight whales got their name because they were the 'right' whale to hunt, desirable to whalers because they were relatively slow and floated when they died. Right whales are easily identifiable by the thick white calluses on their heads. They tend to be social and curious creatures and sometimes have close encounters with humans. They spend the southern winter in warmer waters closer to the equator. The whale featured today surfaced off the Valdes Peninsula, home to the largest breeding population in the world, and a fitting location for the Southern Whale Natural Monument, created in 1984. In these protected waters, thousands of whales will mate and give birth, staying until October or November, when they will begin their great migration south.",

		"description": "There are thousands of waterfalls in Yosemite National Park, but perhaps none are as well known as Bridalveil Fall. First things first: Don't call it 'falls' because then someone may think you were in Utah where another waterfall bears the surprisingly similar name, Bridal Veil Falls. Bridalveil, as seen in the photo, is often the first waterfall visitors to Yosemite encounter. It plunges 617 feet and flows year-round, fed with water from Ostrander Lake nearly 10 miles away. When the flow is light, brisk winds blow the water sideways. That's why the Ahwahneechee Native Americans, who have lived in the Yosemite Valley for centuries, traditionally called the waterfall Pohono, or 'Spirit of the Puffing Wind.'\nWhen Yosemite was made a national park on this date in 1890, it not only preserved this jewel of the Sierra Nevada from being turned over to sheep grazing, it was also pivotal to the continued idea of protecting natural areas for the future. Scottish American environmentalist John Muir is credited with convincing President Benjamin Harrison to preserve the Yosemite Valley, and that success kicked off a string of conservation efforts that would eventually lead to the creation of the National Park System. Today, Yosemite's pristine wilderness is internationally known for mountains, granite cliffs, giant sequoia groves, and, of course, waterfalls.",

The 50th Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta is the largest gathering of balloonists in the world, with more than 500 hot air balloons going aloft this week. The now nine-day event got its start by launching 13 balloons from a shopping mall parking lot in 1972 to celebrate the birthday of a local radio station. It has easily become the biggest event of the year in Albuquerque, whose entire populace can view balloons in flight simply by stepping outside their homes and looking up.\nThe event is staged from the 365-acre Balloon Fiesta Park, on the northern outskirts of Albuquerque with the Sandia Mountains a few miles away. The Balloon Fiesta claims to be the most photographed event in the world, and it's easy to understand why. The highlight of the week is a mass ascension, in two waves, of all the balloons, decorated with every color and some shaped like animals or cartoon characters. In the age of jets and helicopters and rockets, this mass celebration of nearly silent flight reminds us that the magic of flying is not about speed, but simply reaching the sky.",

The expansion is intended to resemble the hull of a sailing ship with a protruding bow glimmering with diamonds, recalling Antwerp's longtime trade in precious stones.\nToday we celebrate World Architecture Day and its 2022 theme of 'Architecture for well-being.' Architecture that preserves historic buildings by combining them with modern structures is becoming more prevalent as cities seek to retain the spirit of their earlier incarnations while creating new, modern spaces and never-before-seen constructions.

Glass octopuses are rarely seen and difficult to observe, but they're a great example of the diversity of the order Octopoda, which we're celebrating today on World Octopus Day. The observance comes around, appropriately, every Oct 8.\nThe more we learn about octopuses, the more fascinating they reveal themselves to be. They're among the most intelligent and behaviorally diverse creatures in the sea. Octopuses can remember and recognize individual humans and are among the very few animals known to be able to use tools. Some, like the giant Pacific octopus, are enormous, and some are tiny. They live in a variety of habitats, from tidal pools to the deepest abyss of the ocean.\nIn the darkness where they live, glass octopuses are nearly invisible, which helps them elude predators like bottlenose whales. Only their eyes give them away. The species is relatively small, with a mantle (the bulbous 'head' that houses the animal's organs) about 4 inches long and a total length of about 18 inches. And their lives, like those of most octopus species, are brief—just a few years. They grow quickly, mature early, reproduce, and die soon after that, never seeing the light of day.",

		"description": "We're celebrating Indigenous Peoples' Day by peering through the sculpture called 'Circle of Sacred Smoke' aka 'Wind Circle' or 'Circle Wind' at Devils Tower, one of the most famous rock monoliths in the US. The 'Circle,' sculpted by Japanese artist Junkyu Muto and installed in 2008, is the third of seven 'peace sculptures' placed around the world. Twelve feet high and made of white marble, it's intended to evoke a puff of smoke from a Native American ceremonial pipe.\nDevils Tower is a majestic Wyoming butte considered sacred by Indigenous tribes of the Great Plains like the Cheyenne, Crow, Lakota, and Kiowa. In myth, Devils Tower is associated not with the devil but with a great bear: Crow and Cheyenne names for it translate to Bear's House, Bear's Lodge, or Bear's Lair. The vertical grooves in the tower are said to be the bear's claw marks.",

		"description": "You may be surprised to learn that this elegant plant dappled with water droplets is a variety of moss: Tortula muralis, better known as wall screw-moss. It's found all over the world, even in urban areas where more sensitive mosses have a hard time thriving because of dry soil and air pollution. Mosses in general are accurate monitors of air pollution—they absorb air and water, so contaminants can also be measured in their cells.\nWall screw-moss is just one of at least 12,000 species of moss, ancient plants that date back 450 million years. The hardy bunch has weathered climate swings for eons, capable of surviving in icy tundra or scorching desert plains. They don't have roots—instead, they absorb moisture through hairlike rhizoids (which also act as anchors) on their surface. This ability to suck in water so efficiently makes mosses among the first plants to recover from forest fires or extreme heat, spreading out to stabilize the soil and keep it hydrated for other plants.\nHow appropriate, then, that our photograph captured raindrops on the moss. This is a perfect example of what's known as macro photography, when the image is many times larger than life-size. All the better to enjoy the delicate beauty of nature.",

This stunning fossil display is known as the Ammonite Pavement, where thousands of ammonite fossils are embedded in a limestone ledge at the west end of Monmouth Beach in Dorset. Although the ammonites look rather like snail shells, these are fossils of extinct sea creatures that are more closely related to today's octopus or squid. Britain's Natural History Museum notes that the fossil-filled ledge is unique in the world because of the sheer number and size of the ammonites: The fossils reach up to 27 inches in diameter. If you want to check them out, timing is everything—the ledge emerges at low tide, and there are more ammonites in large rocks nearby, too.\nToday is National Fossil Day, when we celebrate the fascinating world of extinct creatures and plants. It's no coincidence that it falls during Earth Science Week: We can learn more about our planet and all living things from this visible, touchable legacy of our past.",

Males, called bulls, will mark their scent on trees to attract females. They’ll also fight other bulls for access to females, called cows.\nFights between bulls can sometimes be fatal, and occasionally a bull will have to wait until next year's rut to mate if it loses a fight. Virtually all cows have only one mate per year, but bulls can mate with 25 cows over a 12-month period.",

The tombs of four Achaemenid kings (you can see three of them here) are marked by rock reliefs carved high above the ground into the cliff face. This site and the area around it are of huge significance to the history of Iran and its people. They're also a shining example of the role archaeology plays in understanding our past. On the third Saturday of every October, we pause to celebrate and recognize the contributions of archaeologists as interpreters of human history.\n'Necropolis,' the word for a complex of tombs and burial plots, literally translates as 'city of the dead.' This one is close to the ruins of the ancient Achaemenid ceremonial capital of Persepolis. One of the tombs is identified by an inscription as being the resting place of Darius I, aka Darius the Great, and the others are believed to be the tombs of Darius' son, Xerxes I, Artaxerxes I, and Darius II, leaders during the Achaemenid dynasty from 522-330 BCE. Naqsh-e Rostam is also home to relief carvings depicting kings of the later Sasanian Empire, the last Iranian empire before the Muslim conquests of the 7th and 8th centuries. Only a few hundred yards away is the archaeological site known as Naqsh-e Rajab, with more rock carvings depicting three Sassanid kings and a high priest. While these civilizations have faded, what they created endures as a permanent record of human history.",

It's one of the most numerous owl species in the world with an estimated population between 2 million and 5.5 million long-eared owls widely distributed across the Northern Hemisphere. Our featured friend today was found in the Czech Republic, but they'll adapt to several kinds of habitats.\nMaybe that adaptability is why they're unusually social, as far as owls go. They'll often roost together in large groups—anywhere from 20 to 100 of them may hunker down together for the winter. You might think it would be easy to see such a large group of owls, but long-eared owls are sneaky. They hide in thick cover, which makes them harder to find, especially when their feathers blend in with the surrounding branches and foliage. Early spring, before the leaves have fully returned, is the most likely time you'd catch a glimpse of a 'parliament,' or group, of long-eared owls.",

To commemorate the event, the museum has unveiled a slogan: 'Art Inspires Future.' The museum has also released a special edition of its logo in which the characteristic Gs of the Guggenheim brand move like gears to shape the number 25. Perhaps they'll serve cake as well?\nDesigned by famed Canadian American architect Frank Gehry, the museum not only changed the skyline of Bilbao, Spain, by transforming the city's decrepit port area, it changed the entire way the city was perceived by the world. Architect Philip Johnson called it 'the greatest building of our time.' The acclaim was echoed by critic Calvin Tomkins, writing in The New Yorker, who characterized it as 'a fantastic dream ship of undulating form in a cloak of titanium.'\nSince its opening on this day in 1997, the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao is credited with renewing the Spanish city from a gritty industrial backwater into a glitzy travel hotspot—a metamorphosis now described as the 'Bilbao effect.' Cities around the world have been attempting to repeat the formula: Hire a 'starchitect' to put a neglected locale on the cultural map, which will in turn attract more investment, prestigious brands, and tourism. Some attempts have been more successful than others, but there's no denying that Bilbao has long since arrived.",

		"description": "As you glance over today's photo of the trees changing color in the Thuringian Forest in Germany, make note of the castle in the distance. That's Wartburg, a castle built in the Middle Ages that holds significance to Christians. It was the home of St. Elizabeth of Thuringia (aka St. Elizabeth of Hungary), and later, where Martin Luther translated the New Testament into German while in exile. Wartburg is the area's most popular tourist attraction and has been recognized for its quintessential medieval architecture.\nThere's some clever wordplay in the name Wartburg. 'Warte' is German for both 'watchtower' and 'wait.' Tradition suggests the castle's founder, upon seeing this forested hillside, exclaimed 'Warte, Berg—du sollst mir eine Burg tragen!' or 'Wait, mountain—you shall bear my castle!' Note the 'berg' and 'burg' in that quote, which translate to mountain and fortress, respectively. And so in the grand German tradition of mashing words together, the name Wartburg came to be.\nIf the castle isn't of interest to you, the Thuringian Forest, known as the Green Heart of Germany, has plenty of its own charm for tourists. The oldest and most popular long-distance hiking trail in Germany, the Rennsteig, runs for about 110 miles within the forest. If you're out for a hike you'll notice the general quietness of the area and fresh, unpolluted air. You may even happen upon the tiny villages that pepper the area and have a reputation for welcoming outsiders.",

Your answer depends on how highly you rate the ability to just laze around all day, but in honor of International Sloth Day, let's all just embrace slothfulness. If you want to live the sloth life, head outside and hang upside down in the nearest tree. You won't be able to dangle there as long as a sloth though, because they spend most of their lives doing it. Their arms, legs, hands, and feet evolved for literally 'hanging around' like the pair of Hoffmann's two-toed sloths in today's photo.\nTwo-toed sloths might be better named as two-fingered: They have three toes on their hind legs. Even still, two-toed and three-toed sloths are distantly related, despite a shared preference for living the slow life in rainforests. The mother and child in today's photo are chilling together in a coastal town of Costa Rica. They won't be together forever, though, as part of the sloth's 'best life' is living alone.

Sunny days and crisp nights invite us to step outside to enjoy the changing colors of the leaves. While some may consider the maples of New England the leaf-peeping gold standard, others would give the prize to the aspens of the Rocky Mountains or the cypress trees of the South.\nThese bald cypress trees in Georgia turn brilliant shades of gold, orange, and crimson that rival their northern competitors. Most varieties of cypress are evergreen, but bald cypresses are deciduous—their lacy needles turn this vibrant copper color in autumn and fall in winter, then the trees grow a new set of needles in the spring. Bald cypresses are native to the southeastern US and flourish in the Mississippi River basin along the Gulf Coast. They're a familiar sight in the bayous of Louisiana and also grow in the coastal plains of the mid-Atlantic. Bald cypresses thrive in wet conditions like riverbanks and swamps. Commonly reaching well over 100 feet tall, these slow growers provide important habitat for amphibians, fish, and birds, and they protect coastlines from erosion and flooding. If you're in the area this time of year, head to the swamp to see the autumn display before the gentle giants shed their fall outfits.",

One glance at this swan, seen here holding a feather in a nature preserve in the Netherlands, and it's easy to see how the idiom 'graceful as a swan' came about.\nMute swans are native to Europe and an introduced species in North America. Despite their name, mute swans do make sounds, although they tend to be less vocal than other swan species. The misnomer is also the source of the phrase 'swan song,' which refers to the final act or performance of a long career.

Diyas are a traditional symbol of the festival, and they are arranged on a rangoli, a colorful pattern made on the floor using dried rice flour, colored powdered stone, flower petals, or other colorings. Rangoli designs are more than just attractive—they're believed to attract Lakshmi, the Hindu goddess of wealth and prosperity. Each day of the festival has its own significance, but day three—called Lakshmi Puja—is considered the main event. To prepare for Lakshmi Puja, people clean their homes to welcome Lakshmi's blessings of prosperity and happiness. A rangoli design is created near the entrance to a home or building, and families pass down traditional designs from generation to generation.\nDiwali is one of the most important festivals of the Hindu faith, though it is also embraced by Sikhs, Jains, and even some Buddhists.

Shelley concocted the concept for 'Frankenstein' (aka 'The Modern Prometheus') at Lake Geneva in the northern Alps on the French-Swiss border. She spent an unusually cold and wet summer there in 1816 with her future husband, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and Lord Byron, both poets. Confined indoors, the group challenged one another to come up with ghost stories.

		"description": "Swimming into view like an oceanic Halloween specter, today's 'sea angel' is one of about 3,000 sea slug species. Sea slugs can be found in all the oceans and seas of the world. Scientifically known as nudibranchs, sea slugs are mollusks and today is the day the world celebrates them. What, you didn't know? Perhaps that's because technically it's the birthday of the premier authority on all things related to sea slugs, Terry Gosliner. Gosliner has identified nearly half of the known sea slug species in the world, has written 150 scientific papers about them, and has personally named around 350 individual species. 'Everything about them just piques the imagination,' he says. So, we're saying 'Happy birthday, Terry' by taking a moment to examine the sea angel.\nSea angels are classified in six different families, and they're all remarkably small, with the largest being only about 3 inches long. They can be found anywhere from under the ice in arctic waters to tropical seas and all points in between. Gelatinous in nature, they're also mostly see-through. You see those 'wings' there in the photo? They allow the sea angel to 'fly' around in the water at about 0.22 mph, which may not seem very fast, but it's about twice as fast as its most common prey, the sea butterfly. Belying their name, these angels are ambush predators that actively attack and extract sea butterflies (technically sea snails) from their shells. Some species of sea angels emit a toxin to keep predators away, which has caused other sea creatures to carry them around as a sort of underwater pepper spray to fend off their own predators. Given this, maybe 'sea guardian angel' would be a more fitting name. Someone call Terry.",

Superbly insulated against the cold, polar bears are uniquely suited for life on the ice—so they're especially vulnerable to a warming planet. Their plight is the focus of Polar Bear Week, observed the first week of every November, bringing attention to these creatures who live far out of sight of most humans.\nPolar bears live in portions of Greenland, Norway, Russia, Alaska, and Canada. Most of Canada's polar bears live near the vast Hudson Bay, seen here near the delta of the Seal River. As summer ends, hungry bears who have been living on fat reserves for months gather on the shores of Hudson Bay, waiting for ice to form so they can return to the hunt. Due to climate change, the ice-free period of summer has grown longer, cutting short the bears' hunting season and making human-bear encounters more likely. And while the latter may seem like good news for bear-watchers, these maritime beasts are best viewed from afar.",

		"description": "What better way to spend Halloween than with a ghostly apparition in a scary haunted forest? Today we've (ill-advisedly?) wandered into Wychwood, an English forest with more than its share of spooky backstory. Many people walking in these woods have reported unexplained phenomena, such as feeling a hand on their shoulder and turning to find…no one. Or hearing children wailing as they're driven through the forest in a ghostly horse-drawn carriage.\nBut maybe the most spine-tingling yarn linked to Wychwood is that of Amy Robsart, whose ghost is said to haunt the forest. Born almost 500 years ago, she was the first wife of Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, a favorite—and perhaps love interest—of Elizabeth I of England. Robsart died mysteriously from a fall down the stairs in Cumnor Place, the couple's rented home in Oxfordshire, while Dudley was away at the royal court. But was it murder? Suicide? A simple misstep? Theories and conspiracies abound to this day.\nLegend has it that her apparition lingered at the foot of the stairs, screaming, and Dudley never slept in that house again. But later, as he rode through Wychwood one day, the specter of Robsart caught up with him and told him he'd be dead within 10 days—and he was. So, if you find yourself walking in Wychwood this Halloween, or any night, stay clear of ghostly women with dire warnings.

		"description": "It may seem odd to celebrate death—after all, it's the end of our personal era. But tell that to people who celebrate the Day of the Dead, or el Día de los Muertos, and they'll smile. They may explain that death is part of the circle of life, and as natural as any other human milestone. As our photo shows, the Day of the Dead is a big holiday in Mexico, where calacas—skeleton figures of musicians, workers, and other folks in merry scenes of everyday 'life'—lurk everywhere for weeks before the main event. Of course, living people also play dead for the day, donning skeleton outfits, masks, and grotesque makeup. Music, processions, and food add to the quirky, fun carnival atmosphere.\nThe Day of the Dead has deep roots in Mexico. In Aztec times, for example, the belief was that after people died, they traveled to the Land of the Dead, called Chicunamictlán. Mexico's pre-Hispanic beliefs eventually melded with Catholic celebrations of All Saints' Day and All Souls' Day to create the joyous event celebrated today. Families leave food or other gifts on their loved ones' graves or on homemade altars called 'ofrendas,' welcoming deceased relatives for the day. No wonder it's viewed as a happy holiday—you get to hang out with the spirits of the dearly loved people whom you've lost. (Just don't let Uncle Joe tell one of his jokes.)",

		"description": "Today we're looking back to a time when an eccentric billionaire's dream of reaching new heights was still a novel idea. It was 75 years ago today that Howard Hughes' 'flying boat,' dubbed the 'Spruce Goose,' made its one and only flight. Officially named the Hughes H-4 Hercules, the press persisted in calling it the 'Spruce Goose' even though it was constructed almost entirely of birch wood. The plane was commissioned in 1942 by American industrialist Henry Kaiser, who supplied ships to the US during World War II. Kaiser recruited Hughes—the film producer turned pilot, engineer, and business magnate—to build a flying cargo ship that could avoid German submarines while transporting troops and war supplies across the Atlantic. The contract called for three of the planes to be built within two years. Hughes was still working on the design when the war ended—in the end, he delivered only the one in our photo, two years after V-E Day.\nAdjusted for inflation, the Spruce Goose cost roughly $213 million. It remains the largest flying boat ever built and when it was finished, it had the longest wingspan of any previously built aircraft at 320 feet, 11 inches. Even though the plane was no longer needed for the war effort, Hughes was committed to seeing it fly, which it did, but just barely. After liftoff, it flew at 135 mph roughly 70 feet above the water. It cruised for about a mile for a whopping 26 seconds. 'I put the sweat of my life into this thing,' Hughes had said just a few months prior, vowing to leave the country if it was a failure. Failure is in the eye of the beholder, however, as Hughes never left and his spending of government funds was considered reasonable, because, technically, the Spruce Goose did fly.",

Elephants, lions, and giraffes make their home in the Amboseli. Designated a UNESCO biosphere reserve in 1980, Amboseli was a focus of a UN-sponsored program to ensure the long-term conservation of biodiversity in the area, partly by involving the local population in sustainable use.",

		"description": "A hundred years ago today, British archaeologist and Egyptologist Howard Carter discovered the sarcophagus of Tutankhamun, better known as King Tut, in Egypt's Valley of the Kings. Though they first uncovered the tomb of the 'boy king' on November 4, 1922, Carter and crew took years to excavate the burial site. What they found astonished the world. It was loaded with more than 5,000 artifacts, including a solid gold coffin, face mask, thrones, archery bows, trumpets, a lotus chalice, furniture, food, wine, sandals, gold caps to protect Tut's toes, and fresh linen underwear. Because you should always bring clean undies, even when you're crossing into the realm of the dead.\nThough Tut is considered a minor pharaoh by historians, the discovery of his tomb was one of the most significant in the history of archaeology. The burial site was remarkably well preserved—unlike many neighboring tombs, it was untouched by grave robbers, thanks to debris covering the entrance for most of the tomb's existence. In the 1960s, Egypt allowed the treasures of King Tut to leave the country for display, and the exhibit has traveled the world numerous times. Today, King Tut's death mask and sarcophagus are displayed here at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.",

Writers are also inspired by its beauty: Way back in the early 1800s Sir Walter Scott's poem 'The Lady of the Lake' and novel 'Rob Roy' stirred interest in visiting this area of wooded glens, braes, and waterways called 'the Trossachs.'\nToday many visitors hike or bike the Trossachs Trail, a beautiful 40-mile route that starts at Loch Lomond and winds along rivers and through woods, offering family-friendly adventures as well as challenges for mountain bikers and rock climbers. More of a water person? The Trossachs are also great for canoeing, kayaking, paddleboarding, sailing, swimming, and fishing on rivers and lochs aplenty.",

		"description": "If you missed the first full lunar eclipse of the year back in May, you'll get another chance tonight as the second blood moon (as lunar eclipses are often called) of 2022 takes to the sky over the Pacific region. Tonight's display can be seen from Asia, Australia, North America, and parts of northern Europe and South America. If you're lucky enough to find yourself under a clear sky, the view might look something like this image, taken over Mount Crested Butte, Colorado, during the lunar eclipse of September 27, 2015.\nA lunar eclipse is a happy accident of the solar system and is possible because of relative sizes of and distances between the sun, Earth, and moon. Every couple of years on average, the Earth casts a perfect shadow on the moon, causing a full lunar eclipse. During a full solar eclipse, the moon casts a perfect shadow on the Earth. While not as rare, and perhaps not quite as dramatic as a solar eclipse, lunar eclipses have plenty of upsides. For one, you can safely look at them without doing any harm to your eyes. They last for hours, while solar eclipses last minutes. And a lunar eclipse is visible from a much larger portion of the planet—in fact, the eclipsed moon can be seen at the time of the eclipse wherever the moon is above the horizon.\nIf you want to see tonight's lunar eclipse in the US, you'll likely have to sacrifice some sleep. Totality on the West Coast begins at 2:16 AM, 5:16 AM on the East Coast, and will last about 85 minutes. The next total lunar eclipse won't happen until March 2025, so a few hours of lost sleep seem a small price to pay for this dazzling view.",

In New Zealand, for example, the hedgehog has no natural predators and threatens the food supply of native bush birds. But it's hard to blame such a cute little creature. With roughly 6,000 spines on its back, the hedgehog was, at one point, used as an unofficial symbol for NATO, chosen because it's a peaceful animal that has a rather pointed defense system.",

The military efforts of women, less visible than those of men, are commemorated by the Vietnam Women's Memorial, featured today on Veterans Day. While Memorial Day honors those who died during military service, Veterans Day recognizes the service of all veterans, whether or not they served during a war. Veterans Day, a federal holiday, was originally known as Armistice Day and coincides with the anniversary of the end of World War I. For this reason, other countries also observe today as a holiday.\nThe Vietnam Women's Memorial was officially dedicated on Veterans Day in 1993. During the Vietnam War, 265,000 American women volunteered to serve. About 11,000 were stationed in Vietnam, most as nurses. Women were not allowed to serve in combat roles then as they are now. It took decades before their contributions were publicly acknowledged with the addition of this memorial. It depicts three uniformed women tending to a wounded soldier and reminds us of the roles women played during this and other wars, often behind the scenes, as nurses, physicians, air traffic controllers, translators, and intelligence officers.",

The prestigious World Cup tournament has been held every four years since 1930, except when WWII derailed it in 1942 and 1946. There will be fierce competition in Qatar as the champion French team seeks to defend their title, with the final scheduled for Qatar National Day, December 18. This is the first World Cup hosted by a country in the Middle East, and it's later in the year than usual due to the hot weather in Qatar.\nControversy swirled around Qatar 2022 from the get-go. Senior officials in FIFA, soccer's governing body, expressed concerns about corruption in the process of awarding World Cup hosting to Qatar, though an internal investigation didn't prove any violation. Soon Qatar's treatment of the country's invaluable 2 million migrant workers—most from Africa and Asia—was criticized, with groups like Amnesty International citing unethical labor practices. While Qatar enacted new laws to improve worker safety, conditions, and pay due to the international spotlight, Amnesty has stressed that these laws must also be effectively implemented. Perhaps the extent of the reforms will be revealed as soccer fans flood the nation and the TV cameras roll.",

		"description": "Today we're heading to the Netherlands to visit the red foxes at the Amsterdamse Waterleidingduinen Nature Reserve. This protected area about 8 miles west of Amsterdam is host to not only a diverse assortment of plants and animals, but also hundreds of specially designed sand dunes that help filter rainwater. The Waterleidingduinen ('water supply dunes') have been the source of the city's drinking water since the 19th century.\nMaybe for almost as long, red fox sightings have been common at the Waterleidingduinen. Red foxes are the world's largest foxes and are widespread across the Northern Hemisphere. They stick together with their families, the young often helping to care for the next generation of kits. Not fully content in the woods, red foxes are increasingly colonizing urban areas. It's just the latest move in a long history of foxes sharing the planet with humans, as they appear in the folklore of Native American, Greek, Celtic, and Chinese cultures.",

Helianthus annuus is native to the Americas, and its flowering head is actually made up of more tiny flowers that mature into seeds (and, of course, get eaten around the world). But did you know that sunflowers also bring one of nature's mathematical wonders to life?\nThe gorgeous sunflower displays its seeds in two spirals that twist and curve in opposite directions, fanning out from the center to the golden petals. If you mapped either of those spirals on a graph, they would closely follow the Fibonacci sequence (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21…), where you add a number to the one before it to get the next number. While the famous spiral formula is attributed to Fibonacci, the 13th-century Italian math whiz, scholars in India described the sequence centuries before him—and they probably weren't the first to figure it out either. But regardless of the origin story, each November 23 (11/23…get it?) we celebrate the infinite series known as the Fibonacci sequence.",

Once the fruit ripens in the fall, the beds are flooded with water, creating bogs full of submerged shrubs. A harvester machine dislodges the berries, which float to the top of the water. Then they're easily corralled on the surface with flexible booms.\nThe very sour cranberries will need to be further processed, with lots and lots of sugar, to be palatable as turkey's best friend on the Thanksgiving table. Cranberries grow wild in the wetlands of North America and were an important food for Native Americans, who used them to make pemmican, a nutritious paste of berries, dried meat, and fat. Today, the US accounts for more than half of commercially grown cranberries in the world.",

		"description": "Today we mark Native American Heritage Day and Month with the imposing pyramid now known as Monks Mound, once the center of a city that rivaled any European city of the age in population. Built by people of the Mississippian culture, construction of Monks Mound began early in the 900s CE in present day southern Illinois. By around 1050 the area had grown into a major hub of commerce and agriculture now known as Cahokia. With a population that may have exceeded 40,000 at its peak, Cahokia was the largest urban center north of the great Mesoamerican cities of Mexico and Central America. In the 13th century, for reasons still debated by scholars, the city began to decline, and it was abandoned around 1350. Excavations in the 19th and 20th century revealed a society far more sophisticated and complex than many had believed existed north of Mesoamerica previously.\nNative American Heritage Month celebrates the rich traditions, languages, and stories of Native American, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, and Island communities. Public schools are encouraged to enhance student understanding of Native Americans by providing classroom instruction focusing on Indigenous history, achievements, and contributions, while many government institutions make efforts to recognize the contributions of the first Americans.",

		"description": "While not everyone would recognize this as an olive tree, most of us understand the meaning of the phrase 'extending an olive branch,' long known as a gesture of peace and friendship. That sentiment of compassion, harmony, and wisdom is at the heart of UNESCO's World Olive Tree Day, created in 2019 and observed every November 26. The intent of the day is to bring attention to the resolution of conflict worldwide and to the preservation of the olive tree itself, like this one standing in front of the Temple of Concordia in Agrigento, Italy. The well-preserved, Greek Doric temple was built on what is now the south shore of Sicily, around 440 BCE. Olive trees are native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean and are cultivated today in places with similar climates, like parts of California and Israel. About 90% of harvested olives are used to make olive oil, the quintessential ingredient in Mediterranean cooking.\nThe cultivation of olives is about as old as human civilization itself, as are some of the trees themselves. Although olive trees do not grow very tall, usually no more than 30 feet, they live a very long time. One of the oldest known trees in the world, in Portugal, is believed to be 3,350 years old. Many live for millennia, their trunks growing thick and gnarled, and their branches bearing fruit century after century. As civilizations rise and fall around them, these hardy trees remain resilient and steadfast.",

		"description": "No doubt your eyes are drawn to the large, silver-bluish leaf in today's photo, but there's a little more to this colorful display. We're on the floor of a Mexican rainforest to examine a large Cecropia leaf and some lobster claw petals. The genus called Cecropia contains some of the most recognizable neotropical trees anywhere, but the roughly 60 different species can be hard to tell apart. All Cecropias grow fast, by tree standards anyway. On average, they'll climb about 2.5 feet per year and under perfect conditions can grow as much as 10 feet in that time, eventually reaching around 60 feet tall. When dried, Cecropia leaves shrivel into a fist-like form which displays interesting patterns and shapes. Not only are Cecropias very popular with animals like sloths, monkeys, and toucans for their fruit and leaves, many species have a symbiotic relationship with Azteca ants. Cecropias provide shelter and food for ants, and the ants in turn defend the trees from plant-eating predators.\nThe other striking leaves here are cup-shaped flower petals of the hanging lobster claw plant, or what botanists call the Heliconia rostrata. With its bright colors and distinctive shape, the lobster claw is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for tropical gardens. Gardeners looking to attract birds love the Heliconia because its plentiful nectar draws hummingbirds to its downward-facing flowers. Those same flowers have special recognition in Bolivia as 'patujú,' the national flower, which appears on one of the country's flags.",

Mars, popularly known as the Red Planet, is the fourth planet from the sun, after Mercury, Venus, and Earth. We know more about Mars than any other planet but our own. That knowledge has been gained over centuries and has grown exponentially in recent years with the successful landings on Mars of the Curiosity and Perseverance rovers in 2012 and 2021 respectively. Today we celebrate those and other accomplishments on Red Planet Day, which coincides with the launch of Mariner 4, the first probe sent to Mars, on this day in 1964.\nMars was observed in ancient times as a bright and moving object in the night sky, distinct from the stars. Even its reddish tint was observed by the naked eye. Our curiosity was cemented. It might not be the planet closest to ours—Venus owns that title—but it seems to be the planet that most captures our imagination. The more we learn, the more we can imagine that Mars might have been just like Earth a long time ago, possessing organic life, rivers and oceans, and a much thicker atmosphere than it does today. Current conditions on Mars, while not exactly habitable, are hospitable by comparison to those on other planets, maybe the most compelling reason we're inclined to imagine that living on the Red Planet might someday be possible.",

The male heron finds building materials while the female assembles the nest, then both birds maintain and add to it. The helpful male heron shown here is presenting his mate with nesting material—he seems an apt mascot for this year's Giving Tuesday.\nAlways observed on the Tuesday after Thanksgiving in the US, Giving Tuesday began in 2012. It has since spread around the globe, as other countries have embraced the idea. The purpose of the observance is to encourage everyone to set aside some time to do something good for others.

Inhospitable as it sounds, Antarctica, which lies almost completely below the Antarctic Circle, is also a place of stunning beauty as evidenced by this image of Paradise Harbour, aka Paradise Bay, near the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula. Antarctica is also extraordinarily vulnerable to the effects of climate change, worth remembering today on Antarctica Day, which marks the anniversary of the signing of the 1959 Antarctic Treaty. The international agreement protects Antarctica as a scientific preserve.\nThe Antarctic Peninsula is the northernmost part of Antarctica and the closest to South America, making it relatively accessible. Paradise Harbour is one of the most-visited places on the continent, and a regular stop for cruise ships. The area is home to a thriving colony of penguins and is an excellent place to see glacial calving. While the loss of glacial ice is normal, the process has accelerated at an alarming rate due to global warming. The mile-thick ice sheet that covers Antarctica accounts for 70% of the planet's supply of fresh water. To put that in perspective, if it all melted, sea levels would rise by 200 feet. Without this land of ice, the world would look a lot different.",

That's thanks to a special split hoof that allows them to grip rocky slopes. Being plant eaters, mountain goats tend to spend most of their time grazing and looking for places to lick up much needed minerals.",

This winter dusting of Istanbul, Türkiye's largest city, brings into sharper focus the lines of Rumelihisarı in the center of our image. The structure, also known as Rumeli Fortress, was built in the 15th century by an Ottoman sultan as a way to choke naval traffic through the narrow Bosporus Strait. The Bosporus connects the Sea of Marmara to the Black Sea, separating Istanbul into what are often referred to as its 'European side' and 'Asian side.' Today, the fortress isn't used to fire upon ships but serves as a museum and concert venue. While the place has changed over the centuries, the killer view hasn't.",

When the birds dive deep into the ocean looking for food, their black feathers disguise the birds from predators above, while their white undersides do the reverse. Kings are legendary for their diving prowess—in their quest for tasty squid and lanternfish, they can dive to depths of 300 feet, and some have even been spotted nearly 1,000 feet beneath the surface. Underwater, these flightless birds are the epitome of grace. On land, however, they are not so graceful, and waddle or 'toboggan' on their bellies to get around.",

Mangrove forests not only protect coastlines but are a crucial component of tropical coastal ecosystems and are uniquely suited to thrive in brackish or salty water. These hardy trees can withstand the force of tremendous waves and ferocious winds, fending off the damaging effects of storms and erosion.\nBelow the surface, they work just as hard: Their complex root systems filter out salt and provide shelter and protection for marine life, encouraging biodiversity. Here in Guanahacabibes, that marine life includes several species of turtles as well as red swamp crayfish and a slew of reptiles and amphibians.\nAnother reason to tip our hats to the mighty mangroves? They capture up to 10 times more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than tropical forests do. They're also incredible carbon sinks, storing much more carbon in their roots than their terrestrial counterparts.",

Blake's order to vacate a seat on a Mongomery bus in favor of a white passenger and was arrested and fined for this act of civil disobedience. Parks then helped lead a boycott of Montgomery buses that lasted for over a year. The year-long protest finally ended when the US Supreme Court ruled that Alabama’s laws enforcing segregation on city buses and other modes of transportation were unconstitutional.\nWe're remembering Parks on the anniversary of her birth on Feb 4, 1913. Her act of defiance was a pivotal moment in the civil rights struggle. Though some tried to paint the seamstress as an accidental martyr, Parks was already involved in the movement at the time of her arrest. She later said of the incident, 'People always say that I didn't give up my seat because I was tired, but that isn't true. I was not tired physically, or no more tired than I usually was at the end of a working day. I was not old, although some people have an image of me as being old then. I was forty-two. No, the only tired I was, was tired of giving in.'",

Western Monarch Day marks their seasonal migration to California's Central Coast from cold northern locations west of the Rocky Mountains.\nA grove of eucalyptus trees at Pismo State Beach creates an optimal microclimate for the butterflies. Thousands arrive in the fall and roost through the winter until March, when they begin to fly north. After traveling a relatively short distance inland, the monarchs stop to mate and lay eggs on milkweed plants. The eggs will hatch after just a few days, eventually transforming into the next generation of adult butterflies to continue the trek. The annual cycle takes four or five generations of monarchs to complete, so the butterflies are following in the path most recently traveled by their great-grandparents (or so).\nIn recent years, Western monarch butterfly populations have suffered significant declines, due to climate change and loss of overwintering habitats. We can help protect and restore monarch butterflies by planting native milkweed (their primary food source) and other pollinator-friendly plants in our gardens and yards.",

		"description": "With sweeping views of fjords, mountains, and the sea, this is possibly one of the most beautiful places in the world to rest when you are on the road. Ureddplassen, also known as Uredd Rest Area, provides a place for respite to travelers on a section of the Helgelandskysten national scenic route in Norway. It also serves as a WWII memorial, sharing its name with a Norwegian submarine which was lost when it hit a German mine in February 1943.\nWith its minimalist architecture and breath-taking scenery, Ureddplassen offers a visual experience like no other. It has marble benches and steps leading out to the open sea, and a wave-shaped public restroom with frosted glass that lights up beautifully in the dark.\nSince its unveiling, the rest area has quickly become a popular tourist destination. Here, visitors and locals can witness the midnight sun in summer and feast their eyes on the northern lights in winter.",

Visitors shimmy through tight passages and climb up and down ladders to reach the bottom of the chamber. There they find themselves in an almost otherworldly environment, where sunbeams break through to the canyon floor, making the stone walls glow.\nTour guides, managed by the Navajo Nation, are mandatory for visitors to the canyon.",

Built in the 4th century BCE, this massive open-air venue, which could hold about 14,000 spectators, is known for its perfect architectural proportions. It sits alongside several ancient Greek monuments in the wider Sanctuary of Asclepius, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nThe theater was part of a complex dedicated to Asclepius, the Greek god of medicine, and hosted music, singing and dramatic games that were included in his worship. It has the three main features of the Greek auditoria: a circular space used as the main stage, a stage building that serves as a backdrop, and an ascending row of seats in a semi-circular shape. The theater is a feat of engineering built into the hillside with such precision that it has both perfect acoustics and optimal sight lines.\nThis ancient masterpiece is still in use today, occasionally hosting musical events and welcoming theatrical performances for the Epidaurus Festival each summer.",

It is only the males that sing and each whale population has its own song. Although the exact purpose is still a mystery, it is thought the songs might allow them to communicate with other whales over vast distances and help navigate new areas.

About 80 Hani villages with traditional thatched houses and farming methods, including buffaloes working the fields, are part of this landscape, where people and nature have worked in harmony for centuries.",

Each year, marchers pass by the Great Mother of the Gods on her chariot drawn by lions, as they turn out in their thousands to campaign for gender equality in Spain's capital city.\nInternational Women's Day has its roots in the US labor movement in the early 20th century. In 1908, 15,000 women marched in New York City for better working conditions and the right to vote and a national women's day was declared in 1909. The following year, German activist Clara Zetkin put forward the idea of holding an international women's day at a conference in Copenhagen. She got unanimous backing and the first one was celebrated on March 19, 1911, in Austria, Denmark, Switzerland, and Germany. It wasn't until 1975 that it was officially recognised by the United Nations.\nThese days, International Women's Day is observed on March 8 in many countries around the world, a date to celebrate women's achievements and to continue to campaign for full gender equality.",

So, if you want to see the true variety of Kauai, leave the beach behind and take the winding Route 550 into the mountains for stunning views of the shore and canyon, before arriving at the lookout to enjoy the best view of Waipo'o Falls.

These black-and-white giants start off small—a newborn panda is about the size of a stick of butter—but after eating their way through between 26 and 84 pounds of bamboo a day, male adults can weigh in at up to 300 pounds.\nChina's Chengdu Panda Base, pictured on our homepage, houses one of the world's largest populations of giant pandas bred in captivity. Their journey started with six rescued giant pandas in the 1980s, and the base is now home to about 150 of these beautiful animals. In the wild, panda numbers are rebounding after years of decline thanks to conservation efforts. The species has been upgraded from 'endangered' to 'vulnerable' but they still require our help—and events like Panda Day—to raise awareness of the need to protect these loveable giants.",

While not everyone is a fan, frogs play a critical role in the food chain, eating pests like mosquitoes, flies, spiders, and even mice.\nIt is estimated that at least 200 species of frogs have gone extinct in the last five decades and there are fears hundreds more will follow. So, this April, let's take a moment to learn more about these little amphibians and ways to save them. Even the smallest changes, such as being more wary of how we dispose of our trash, can be immensely beneficial for this important species.",

Native Americans named it for the pink wildflowers, moss pink or creeping phlox, that bloom in the eastern US in the spring.\nIf it does appear pink, orange, or golden, it is because sunlight reflects off the moon and travels through our atmosphere. Here, dust, pollution, and other particles scatter the light, making it appear more colorful when it hangs lower in the sky. It appears whiter as it rises.

It says the giant Fionn mac Cumhaill, anglicized as Finn McCool, built a bridge across the sea to fight his Scottish giant counterpart, Benandonner. The remains of his bridge are said to be found in the Giant's Causeway on one side, and Fingal's Cave on the Scottish island of Staffa, also formed by basalt columns.

One theory is that, because animal products were not eaten during the religious Lenten season, people would hard-boil the eggs and decorate them with dye and wax, until they could be eaten at Easter. A more opulent type of decorated egg, Fabergé eggs, were famously created as bejeweled Easter gifts to the Russian imperial family.

In 1872, Nebraska City News editor Julius Sterling Morton proposed a day for locals to plant trees, and the idea grew and grew. Today all 50 states celebrate Arbor Day, most commonly on the last Friday in April, although different states might observe it on the best dates for tree planting in their area.\nGiant sequoias, like the ones on our homepage, have been around for a very long time. Geological evidence suggests that they are the third-longest-lived tree species in the world. There are hundreds of them in Yosemite's Mariposa Grove, including the famous Grizzly Giant, which is estimated to be about 3,000 years old. Let's hope it is around for thousands of Arbor Days to come.",

		"description": "Get your telescope and star map app ready because it's Astronomy Day! Doug Berger, then president of the Astronomical Association of Northern California, created Astronomy Day in 1973 to get more people interested in the wonders of space. He set up telescopes on street corners, malls, and parks to give people a chance to see the stars firsthand.\nEarly astronomers lacked the means to view celestial objects beyond those which could be seen by the naked eye. But they still made major discoveries, such as calculating the size and distance of the moon, affirming the sun as the center of our solar system, and predicting the movement of stars relative to the seasons. Today we have sophisticated telescopes, from the orbiting James Webb Space Telescope to the portable ones you'll find in use at International Dark Sky Parks, including Joshua Tree National Park, seen in our photo. With such ground-breaking technology at our disposal, astronomers can boldly go where no human eyes have gone before.",

Instead, May 5 marks Mexico's victory over better-equipped French forces at the Battle of Puebla on May 5, 1862. Although the French Empire would counterattack and take the city a year later, the unexpected victory was a morale boost which still has symbolic significance. While in the US, Cinco de Mayo is a popular festival celebrating Mexican American culture, celebrations in Mexico are relatively quiet and focused mostly on Puebla.\nIn Mexico, the celebration became known as Battle of Puebla Day after President Benito Juárez declared it a national holiday in 1862. Today, the people of Puebla celebrate with parades, speeches, and battle reenactments. The Church of Nuestra Señora de los Remedios in Puebla, pictured here, was already nearly 300 years old when the 1862 battle was fought.

His bloody resistance to Ottoman encroachment made him a national hero and the subject of much folklore—some of it gruesome. These tales are likely what inspired author Bram Stoker to name his fictional vampire Count Dracula.\nPoenari Castle was abandoned decades after Vlad's death in 1476. Over the centuries, it fell into ruin as earthquakes and landslides sent parts of the building down the cliff and into the Argeș River below. Visiting the ruins today requires a bit of stamina. It's a 1,480-step climb to the citadel walls, unless you can change into a bat and fly to the top.",

		"description": "With distinctive markings on their shells, western box turtles, such as the one seen here, are among the most widely recognized turtle species and one of two box turtle species in the US. Box turtles are named after their dome-shaped shells which are hinged at the bottom, allowing the shell to close like a box if it needs to hide from predators. They generally live for around 25 years but can survive for more than 50, and there have been reports of some living for 100 years.\nSome turtles may have existed more than 100 million years ago but while they outlived the dinosaurs, more than half of all turtle and tortoise species are now on the verge of extinction. Today is World Turtle Day, an event set up to celebrate these incredible creatures and highlight their disappearing habitats.",

Situated in a strategic location between the Ionian and Adriatic seas, Corfu became one of the most fortified places in Europe amid successive sieges by the Ottoman Empire. The island was ruled by the Republic of Venice for 400 years until the late 18th century, which built forts in Corfu's Old Town to defend its maritime trading interests. They held off three Ottoman sieges in 1537, 1571, and 1716 but have been repaired, rebuilt, and added to over the centuries. The Old Fortress has witnessed the rise and fall of mighty empires for hundreds of years, from the tip of a rocky peninsula jutting into the sea. These days, however, it is home to the public library and Corfu's archives.",

		"description": "Juneteenth is here, a day celebrating the freedom of enslaved African Americans shortly after the end of the Civil War. While Abraham Lincoln's final Emancipation Proclamation in January 1863 freed slaves in Confederate states, certain areas did not abolish slavery until months after Confederate forces surrendered. Texas issued an order on June 19, 1865, that 'all slaves are free.' This act was the origin of Juneteenth, which combines the words June and nineteenth. However, slavery did not fully end in the US until the 13th Amendment was ratified on December 6, 1865.\nThe holiday has been recognized in every state since 1979. Modern celebrations and jubilees include concerts, marches, fairs, and buildings lit up with red, black, and green like we see in our photo. Juneteenth offers us the opportunity to celebrate progress while also challenging ourselves to identify the ongoing work that needs to be done.",

The bald eagle, named for its white-feathered head, was once an endangered bird, but conservation efforts and the Endangered Species Act have helped boost its numbers.\nToday's image was taken in the Tongass National Forest in southeast Alaska, which has the highest nesting density of bald eagles in the world. Eagles are picky when it comes to selecting a tree in which to nest. They like tall ones that offer a good view of their surroundings.

Exactly why and how this massive stone circle was built are still debated. What we do know, is that it was done without metal tools or the use of wheels—and some of those stones were moved more than 150 miles.\nOn the summer solstice, the longest day of the year, the sun rises directly over the largest stone, the Heel Stone, creating a captivating spectacle. On the winter solstice, the shortest day, the sunset aligns with the stones, casting an enchanting glow upon the ancient site. Stonehenge's precise alignment with astronomical events suggests its importance in ancient ceremonial practices, making it an iconic symbol of human ingenuity and our connection to the cosmos.",

		"description": "It's lunch time for these beautiful monarch butterflies, which like to feed on clusters of colorful wildflowers. While they dine out on nectar, they get a light dusting of pollen, which is then spread to other flowers they land on. This process is pollination, transferring pollen from the male part of a flower to the female part, and is crucial for growing many of our fruits and vegetables. It improves the quality and quantity of crops and increases harvest yields. Nearly $20 billion of goods are produced in the US alone each year, because of pollination.\nPollinators are a critical part of food systems and ecosystems, but their numbers have declined due to various threats including loss of habitats, pesticides, and climate change. Pollinator Week, held in June each year, aims to raise awareness of pollinators and what we can do to protect them. You can mark the week by avoiding using pesticides and creating a pollinator-friendly habitat for butterflies, bees, and other pollinators, helping them continue to play their essential role in plant reproduction.",

From the graceful hammerhead with its panoramic vision to the fastest species, the sleek mako, shark species are diverse, but a third face extinction. Among threats are unregulated fishing and abandoned nets as well as demand for shark fins. They have a fearsome reputation but are the victims of myths and misconceptions that paint them as mindless killing machines. Today, let's celebrate these magnificent creatures, a key part of healthy marine ecosystems, by advocating for their conservation.",

Its narrow alleys and cobblestone streets pass buildings that cling to the mountainside. This picturesque destination is brimming with history; from its rule by feudal lords to battles long forgotten. It's believed that the Normans settled here around the 11th century AD and constructed a castle, from which the village gets its name. Castelmezzano isn't just a sleepy portrait of the past, it also offers adventure activities for the brave, including a high-altitude zip line between mountains on the Volo dell'Angelo (Flight of the Angel). Yet the finest pleasure the small village offers might just be grabbing a cup of coffee and watching the sun rise behind the majestic mountain peaks, illuminating those huddled houses as the streetlamps go out.",

The philosophical concept of infinity dates back at least as far as ancient Greece.\nTaipei, the capital of Taiwan, was founded in the 18th century.

		"description": "Lions are known as 'the king of the jungle,' but on World Lion Day, let's set the record straight: Lions don't live in the jungle. Lions lounge in lordly leisure and hunt with ferocious focus on grasslands and plains. When they're not hunting, these majestic creatures nap, wrestle, and groom each other. But in an instant, they're chasing down a hapless gazelle or a hippopotamus that's wandered too far from the safety of its river. Like the opening song of 'The Lion King' movie says, it's the circle of life. World Lion Day is our opportunity to (ahem) lionize these regal beasts and raise awareness of threats to their well-being like poaching, habitat destruction, and other human-lion conflicts.",

The railway was sold to the US government and rebuilt as an automobile highway, opening in 1938.\nThese days, the Overseas Highway still stretches about 113 miles through the Florida Keys over 42 bridges, which jump from island to island over the Atlantic Ocean, Florida Bay, and the Gulf of Mexico. Many of the original bridges were replaced in 1982, including the longest, the Seven Mile Bridge pictured in the distance in our homepage image. Drivers crossing the Overseas Highway can still see remnants of some of the old bridges running alongside their replacements, including the Old Seven Mile Bridge, a section of which was renovated for cyclists and pedestrians.

In 1894, President Grover Cleveland signed a bill declaring the first Monday in September as Labor Day. Today, Labor Day marks the unofficial end of summer, but let's not forget to take a moment to give thanks for the work we all put in to take care of our communities, our families, and ourselves.",

It's a common misconception that Mount Sopris was a volcano but, although magma built up beneath its surface, it never erupted. Instead, it crystallized about 10,000 feet beneath the Earth's surface, creating a massive rock-covered dome. Erosion by rain, melting snow and glacial ice then shaped it into this twin-peaked giant over tens of millions of years.\nMount Sopris was a hallowed site for Indigenous peoples, including the Ute tribes who have historically inhabited the region. The Roaring Fork and Crystal Valleys served as seasonal dwellings and hunting territories for the Parianuche and Yampa bands of the Ute people.

It was the summer residence of the ruling Habsburg emperors from the 18th century to 1918, having been redeveloped by Empress Maria Theresa in the 1740s. Complemented by its lush gardens, which house the world's oldest existing public zoo, the palace itself is a gem of Europe's opulent Baroque era. Schönbrunn Palace Park has been open to the public since 1779 and both it and the palace, now under the ownership of the Austrian government, are listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This leaf-strewn path offers an escape from the bustling city. So, take a stroll on this enchanting estate and let yourself be transported to centuries past.",

From atop the bridge's weathered, mossy stones, travelers can take in the majestic Cuillin Mountains in the distance.

The windmills are thought to have inspired Cervantes to write the famous scene in which Don Quixote mistakes them for an army of giants. With their stone walls and wooden blades, some date back to the 16th century, when they were built to grind grain.\nCastilla-La Mancha is the third-largest region—after Castile y León and Andalusia—in Spain but one of the least densely populated. The regional capital city, Toledo, has a significant architectural and cultural legacy—including Old Town and the Catedral de Toledo—that led to its designation as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1986.

Ravens are known for their playful behavior and their omnivorous diet, feeding on a wide variety of foods, including carrion, insects, and small mammals.\nRevered across various cultures, ravens have frequently appeared in literature and legends. In Edgar Allan Poe's famous poem, 'The Raven,' this bird serves as a symbol of death and melancholy, haunting the protagonist with its ominous refrain of 'nevermore.' Native American folklore often portrays the raven as a cunning and mystical trickster, with some tribes believing it possessed the power to shape-shift.

Between early November and January, thousands of gray seal pups are born on the shoreline, a little earlier than those on US coasts. The seal moms feed their pups on the beach for three weeks, during which time the pups gain about 4.5 pounds a day. They stay on the beach until they shed their pale fur to make way for a waterproof, mottled gray coat. Then it's time to head to the sea and learn to hunt for themselves.",

Bring your binoculars with you, and if it's summertime, be on the lookout for pronghorn, which travel about 150 miles to get there from Wyoming's Upper Green River Basin. They aren't the only creatures to visit seasonally; elk and bison are also summer visitors. These migrations play a vital role in the ecosystem of Grand Teton National Park.

Written records tell of an early thanksgiving shared between Plymouth Pilgrims and Wampanoag Native Americans, who provided a harvest of corn, deer, and turkey. There were many early days of thanksgiving, but an official, national celebration was proclaimed by George Washington in 1789, and has been a part of our holiday season ever since. Today, we wish you good company and plenty of things to be thankful for. Happy Thanksgiving!",

		"description": "Among their feathered friends, Bohemian waxwings cut striking figures with their pointed crests, 'blushing' faces, and velvety gray plumage with splashes of color. Large groups wander across the northern US and Canada in search of food, swooping on trees and shrubs to find fruit. In winter, they feast upon cotoneaster, juniper, and rowan berries. As spring casts its spell, these nomads settle down for the breeding season. The female waxwings craft the nests, laying two to six bluish-gray eggs, and hatchlings are fed a diet of insects and fruits by both parents. One can easily spot these sociable birds, as they often gather in chirpy flocks in North America and Eurasia.",

Their low calls can be heard by other lynx, and they are primarily active at night, dawn, and dusk, although they can hunt by day if needed. These solitary hunters have keen senses and remarkable agility, able to climb trees and jump more than 6 feet straight up to catch prey. In temperate forests, they mainly dine out on rabbits, hares, marmots, and other small mammals, although they can take on prey as large as deer.",

To avoid this, males often ease their way through crowded colonies with their heads tucked down to their chests. The main threats though, are not their fellow penguins.

This centuries-old festival combines revelry with anonymity, thanks to the masks traditionally worn by attendees, from the classic square-jawed Bauta mask to the Colombina eye mask, with roots in Italian theater. Costumed rowers take part in a parade of traditional boats on Venice's famous Grand Canal while thousands of people wearing elaborate costumes enjoy the carnival atmosphere. Parades, parties, concerts, and performances will fill the streets until festivities end on Shrove Tuesday, which falls on February 13 this year. Visitors might pass by the Santa Maria della Salute, seen toward the back of today's image, a baroque basilica dedicated to the Virgin Mary, who is considered to be the protector of the city.",

Humans are thought to have sought shelter here as far back as the Early Stone Age, about 70,000 years ago, and many Neolithic artefacts from 6000-4000 BCE have been discovered. Several large openings in the cave cast natural light into the chambers, offering better illumination for photographers and nature lovers alike.",

His observations on the remote volcanic islands in the eastern Pacific Ocean would help him to develop his famous theory of evolution through natural selection. While studying the creatures here, he concluded that many South American species, mainly reptiles and birds that could cross the vast expanse of water, had migrated to the Galápagos and gradually adapted to their surroundings.\nAmong animals Darwin encountered were Galápagos giant tortoises, like those featured on our homepage. They grow up to 5 feet in length but have different shaped shells, depending on which island they inhabit. The islands are named after these magnificent creatures, 'galápago' meaning freshwater tortoise in Spanish. Today, on International Darwin Day, let's celebrate these gentle giants, which contributed to one of the great scientific discoveries of the 19th century.",

The date was chosen to coincide with the time when cubs are in their dens being protected by their mothers, as this is the most vulnerable time in a polar bear's life.\nThese apex predators live and hunt on Arctic sea ice. Their prey largely consists of seals, but they have been known to eat beluga whales, reindeer, and other Arctic animals. The polar bears in today's image are in Kaktovik, a small Inupiat whaling community in Alaska. The bears visit the village during the fall, attracted by carcasses left behind by whale hunters.",

		"description": "Bamburgh Castle perches on a crag of volcanic rock, overlooking sand dunes and the coast of Northumberland, England. The fortress, once a strategic Anglo-Saxon stronghold, evolved over centuries into the imposing structure seen today. The site was the seat of the ancient Northumbrian kingdom—an early medieval Anglo-Saxon kingdom covering present-day northern England and southeast Scotland. The original castle was destroyed by invading Vikings in 993 and a new castle was built here by the Normans. Today's castle is the result of various restorations in the 18th, 19th, and early 20th centuries. After surviving its share of attacks, Bamburgh Castle has made its way to the limelight due to its impressive silhouette against the North Sea, featuring in productions like 'Macbeth,' 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,' and 'Ivanhoe.'",

A leap year is a calendar oddity that exists because Earth's orbit and our usual year count are slightly out of sync. Earth takes 365.25 days to revolve around the sun. To compensate for those extra 5 hours, February gets an extra day—leap day—every four years. The concept, dating back to the ancient Romans, was refined in the Gregorian calendar, introduced in 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII. While the purpose of the day is to keep our year aligned with the solar calendar, it can also serve as an extra day to prepare for spring! Cultures worldwide mark leap days and years with unique customs. In Ireland and Britain, women propose to men, in Greece, marrying during a leap year is said to bring misfortune, and in France, a satirical newspaper is published.",

Established by the UN 11 years ago, the day draws attention to the need to preserve these essential ecosystems, which supply food, water, medicines, and other resources. Covering over 30% of land on Earth, it is thought that woodlands around the world contain more than 60,000 tree species. Featured here is the Bwindi Impenetrable National Forest in Uganda, which is home to 160 species of trees and 100 species of ferns, as well as an extraordinary 50% of the world's mountain gorilla population. The forest has thickets of bamboo growing between the trees, making access on foot difficult, giving the Impenetrable Forest its name.",

		"description": "It's World Water Day, a United Nations event that ripples across the globe, reminding us of the importance of this essential resource. Water quenches thirst and irrigates harvests, and its absence can derail prosperity and stability. The World Economic Forum lists the water crisis among the top global risks, with 2.2 billion people still lacking access to clean water. From educational forums to local cleanups, each action, big or small, contributes to the wave of change needed to address the crisis. This year's theme, 'Water for Peace,' invites us to reflect on water's power to foster unity. So, are you ready to dive into a current that flows deeper than New Zealand's Blue Spring at Te Waihou Walkway, pictured on our homepage? This clear spring is renowned for its purity, supplying about 70% of the country's bottled water. For those in regions without easy access to safe water, World Water Day is here to promote greater cooperation to help conserve this crucial resource, for everyone.",

		"description": "'When clouds appear like rocks and towers, the Earth's refreshed with frequent showers.' There's a whisper of truth to this old proverb for the storm clouds, also known as cumulonimbus or anvil clouds, which are pictured here. Today, on World Meteorological Day, we honor the marvel that is our atmosphere. This observance, first held in 1961, commemorates the establishment of the World Meteorological Organization and recognizes the vital role meteorology plays in our lives. Weather forecasts may not always appear reliable, but thanks to advances in technology like satellites and supercomputers, they have come a long way. Global weather models provide forecasts for up to 16 days and, the average lead time for tornado warnings is now around 15 minutes. Cheers for the progress made and much more to come!",

		"description": "Yellow, round, tiny, and gregarious—say hello to these silvereyes enjoying cherry blossoms in South Korea. While this family of passerine birds is native to Africa, Australasia, and Asia, several of its species can be found in places like French Polynesia and Hawaii, where they appeared by introduction. Also known as white-eyes or wax-eyes, these birds come in a range of colors and patterns, but they all share that trademark eye ring. They have a sweet tooth for nectar, but they're not picky eaters, happily feeding on fruits, insects, and berries. Let's celebrate these beauties for adding a touch of wonder to spring!",

		"description": "It's Holi; get ready to become a walking rainbow and sprinkle joy wherever you go! This festival of colors, spring, and love is a cornerstone of Indian and Nepali culture. It is also celebrated in other countries with large Hindu populations, such as Bangladesh, Pakistan, the US, the UK, Suriname, Indonesia, and Malaysia. Festivities last for a night and a day, starting on the evening of the last full moon in the Hindu calendar month of Phalguna, which usually falls in March in the Gregorian calendar. As the sun sets, people gather to light bonfires, a ritual known as Holika Dahan, symbolizing the triumph of good over evil. The following day, the streets come alive with people splashing each other in colors, giving everyone a vibrant makeover. Are you ready for the hues of Holi?",
