### Version 2 roadmap

After two years, I decided to rewrite the entire project and fix numerous issues including storage capacity and metadata.

Stages (roughly in order of importance):

- [x] Proper everyday image retrieval from three sources
- [x] Uploading images to external storage (chose Google Cloud for now)
- [x] Removing metadata nonsense â€” images should be preserved in their original form
- [x] Upload alll images to storage
- [x] Replace spaces by `\t` in api to reduce space
- [ ] Fix metadata for all images (currently done: ?/?)
- [x] Finally remove all images from this repo and reduce the size of repo (+ number of commits in repo)
- [ ] Write a comprehensive README
- [ ] Enable other countries
- [ ] Improve website + add protection for GCloud (because 5s per image ~= 500'000 images per month if sombody decides to leave the page open for so long xd)
- [ ] Deal with integrity errors (see [TODO](#todo) below)
- [ ] Update (and upload to storage) videos, if needed
- [ ] Find a way to retrieve videos from Bing (identify that today's image is a video, etc.)


### Usage

All information is stored in "API files"[^1] in the <code><a href="api">api/</a>{country}</code> directories

The following countries are currently available: <a href="api/US"><code>US</code></a>

One API file consists of an array of image data:
```jsonc
[
    // Types and descriptions:
    {
        "title": "{Title}" | null,
        "caption": "{Caption}" | null,
        "subtitle": "{Subtitle}" | null,
        "copyright": "{Copyright}" | null,
        "description": "{Description}" | null,
        "date": "{Date in %Y-%m-%d format with leading zeros}",
        "path": "{Path to image in this repo: {country}/images/{date}.jpg}",  // To be removed in v2
        "bing_url": "{URL of image on Microsoft servers}" | null,
        "url": "{URL of image in storage}" | null  // After v2 this field will be required (no null)
    },
    // Example:
    {
        "title": "Example title",
        "caption": "Example caption",
        "subtitle": "Example subtitle",
        "copyright": "npanuhin/Bing Wallpaper Archive Â©",
        "description": "Example description\nThat can span multiple lines",
        "date": "2009-06-03",
        "path": "US/images/2009-06-03.jpg",
        "bing_url": null,
        "url": "https://{storage_url}/US/images/2009-06-03.jpg"
    },
]
```

- Images are sorted by `date` in ascending order (oldest first, newest last)

- The `bing_url` field contains the original image URL from Bing (Microsoft) servers. Unfortunately, it is not possible to retrieve images from more than a couple of years ago from these URLs (they all point to the same dummy image)

> [!NOTE]
> API files tend to be quite large (a couple of MB)

> [!TIP]
> Feel free to use the API files and images, but please **avoid sending frequent requests** (for images this would incur additional costs for me on GCloud Storage).
>
> <a name="sometext"></a>If you need to make frequent requests to the API files, I recommend downloading and caching them locally (they are updated only once a day). The same applies to the images (although this will be quite difficult to implement)
>
> Your understanding and cooperation are greatly appreciated ðŸ™‚


### TODO

- **Missing images (!)** (`src/check_status.py` shows 4 images)
    UPD: probably those are videos, need to check
- Add more images from 2009
- Videos update

<!-- -  `2016-06-05` copyright: `Â© Heinz Wohner/Getty Images` vs `Â© Richard Du Toit/Minden Pictures` -->

- Multiple months are missing one image on the last day
- Month `2016-02` has two duplicate images and is missing one image


[^1]: These files are not a typical [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API), but they are used to retrieve all valuable information. In some sence they are the Interface of my Application (though not really a Programming Interface)
